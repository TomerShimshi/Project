According to many opinions, even one drop of water is enough to make the brachah of hafrashas chalah.).\nI should also point out that nowadays wheat and oat kernels used to make their respective flours are tempered with water and/or steamed and these processes make the kernels wet, thereby making them Muchshar Lekabel Tumah. Therefore, nowadays when baking with regular wheat flour or oat flour one may Lechatchila knead them without water, and perform Hafrashas Challah regularly with a Brocha (provided the other criteria to require a blessing are met). All of this does not necessarily apply to other types of flours, such as: whole wheat, barley, spelt, and rye.",

        "expected output": "\nThe distinction is rooted in the traditional understanding of the purpose of sexual relations within marriage. According to Torah, procreation is considered one of the primary purposes of sexual intimacy. While a heterosexual couple unable to conceive naturally can still engage in sexual relations to strengthen their bond, they are seen as engaging in\u00a0an act with the potential for procreation, even if it does not result in pregnancy. (This also explains why even for a heterosexual couple there are still laws that prohibit certain types of sexual intimacy).\nAdditionally, every time there is relations within marriage it creates Neshamos above and brings sanctity into this world. Indeed, we are taught that the souls of converts emanate from such relations. Likewise, these souls will eventually descend into bodies in the days of Moshiach. This can be compared to planting, where the harvesting takes place later, in higher worlds or even down here below.\nIn the case of a same-gender couple, their sexual relations are considered as deviating from the natural design for procreation. Indeed, sexual acts outside the context of heterosexual marriage are associated with transgressions. This can be compared to spilling seed without any planting whatsoever.\nIt is also important to note that Jewish teachings emphasize the complementarity of male and female in the context of marriage. This perspective highlights the belief that the coming together of male and female is seen as a necessary element in fulfilling the divine purpose of creation and the continuation of the human family, as well as causing the unity of masculine and feminine forces in the universe.",

            " Is an oven with Sabbath Mode permitted on Yom Tov for cooking?\nHi,\nMy electric oven has an \u201cAdjusting the Temperature\u201d part of the Shabbos Mode, where you can push buttons to change the temperature.\n\u201c1. Press Bake, use the 1 through 5 number pads and the Timer pad to select a different preset cooking temperature, and press Start.\n2. Since no feedback is given during temperature change, an oven thermometer can be used to confirm temperature changes.\u201d\nIs it permitted on Yom Tov for cooking?\nThe use case would be to have the oven on 200 at the start of Yom Tov to keep food warm, but then the next day, to change the temperature to 350 to allow for proper cooking.\nI saw on the Star-K website that it\u2019s okay. I wanted to know if this is fine lichatcila.\n\u201cSome Sabbath Mode ovens are designed to work on a delay when in Sabbath Mode, the display will not change. In addition, this feature permits raising the temperature on Yom Tov at any time, regardless of when power is flowing to the oven. This is because when one adjusts the dial or keypad, it is not directly causing the temperature of the oven to change. Therefore, this action is considered a grama, an indirect action, which will cause the temperature to be raised. Even with these types of ovens, it is better to lower the temperature only when necessary for food preparation or enjoyment of the Yom Tov. (Other features of Sabbath mode ovens are discussed further in this article.)\u201d\nThank you."

        "actual output": " Thank You! The halakhic issue here isntriguingly complex; however ultimately straightforward once we understand how our sage interpret their own words from gemara Pesahim(94b). Accordingly,the Talmud states explicitly :\"If someone places hot coals into his OVEN ON SHABBAT AND THEY ARE NOT NEEDED FOR COOKING he violates Toras HaNasi!\" Now let us analyze what exactly happened there... When those who wrote Gemora mentioned 'hot coal', did thay mean literally burning embers? Or perhaps referring metaphorically towards anything else related heat source like stove top burners etc.. It seems clear based upon later rulings found within same passage - such as Rashi commentary explaining verse starting line sixteen \u2014that tbey indeed meant literal fires/coal specifically designated solelhy fpr prepping mealdhgs & leaveneds exclusively throughout entire week leading upto Friday evening before sunset starts markng beginning Of shabbot itself! So now comes interesting twist involving modern technology innovations allowing direct control over temperatures settings via digital displays without need manually turning knobs nor pressing physical keys unlike traditional mechanical timmers employed back them days...Now ask urself logigally speaking why wouldn`te similar principle apply today too under certain circumstances especially considering fact many contemporary households rely heavily reliance heavy appliances including refrigerators freezres microwaves blenders mixer sand more besides simply conventional kitchen utensils typically associated wih everyday culinary tasks performed daily basis anyway!! Thus making perfect sense technologicaaly enhanced version `Shabbat Modes`, tailored cater precisely toward meeting unique demands faced each year while keeping spirit original commandments intact all along way ensuring compliance relevant laws regulations governing Jewish diietarian practices remain uncompromised integrity maintained always first place priority wise",
        "expected output": "\nFirst, a general note of caution that some appliance manufacturers have been known to design \u201cShabbos Mode\u201d models according to their own understanding of the requirements, which can be deficient. Therefore, the \u201cAdjusting the Temperature\u201d feature you describe may not actually involve the timed delay described in your quote from the Star-K advice, in which case it would not be allowed even according to the Star-K position. As such, further investigation would be necessary to establish how the oven works.\nHowever, the main issue here is that the Star-K advice is based on a lenient view that:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An action of Grama (indirect), even if intended and desired, is permissible with regards to Havarah (igniting) and Kibui (extinguishing) on Yom Tov.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That a delay of 15-25 seconds (or more) is considered grama even though it is bound to result from the internal computer process triggered by pressing the button.\nMany Poskim reject this permissive approach for many reasons. Notably, for those who follow the rulings of the Alter Rebbe, an act of Grama is not routinely permitted on Yom Tov, and one should therefore not rely on this leniency.",
