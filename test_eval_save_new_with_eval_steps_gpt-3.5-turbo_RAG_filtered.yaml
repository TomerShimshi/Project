        You mentioned that you are fairly certain that the body is Non-Jewish. Therefore,
        we will answer accordingly. However, it is important to note that some schools
        do in fact use Jewish cadavers (though not often). So, if possible, it may
        be a good idea to ask about the history of your cadaver. If not possible,
        you can work under the assumption that the body you are working on is in fact
        not Jewish (outside of Israel obviously).

        In respect to your question, a non-Jewish cadaver donated to science for the
        purpose of medical education is okay to be studied on. This is because it
        is for the sake of medicine and the potential of finding cures for life threatening
        conditions.

        That said, when you are in the anatomy lab working on a cadaver you should
        always keep in mind that the Tzelem Elokim applies to all humans and therefore
        work respectfully on the body. This includes not talking divrei chol, not
        joking around the body (as many students unfortunately do), and overall respect
        for the person who graciously donated their body for your education.

        There are a number of organizations that may assist you with these challenges
        and others as you continue your medical career. One that comes to mind is
        an organization recently founded by frum medical students called the Jewish
        Physicians Network

        \ every time there is relations within marriage it creates Neshamos above\
