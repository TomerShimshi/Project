""I have set Hashem before me always."" This is a fundamental rule of
the Torah and of the attributes of the righteous who walk before God.
For we cannot compare a person's lifestyle, his activities and affairs
when he is alone, to his lifestyle, and activities and affairs when he is
before a great king. Similarly, his conversation and speech when he is
amongst family or relatives, [cannot be compared] to what they would
be in the presence of a king, because then he would certainly take
special care that all his activities and conversations be refined and
correct. How much more so when you contemplate that Hashem, the
greatest of kings, the Holy One, blessed is He, Whose glory fills the
entire world, stands above you and views your actions, as it is said: ""If a
person will hide in hidden places will I not see him? Says the word of
Hashem, Do I not fill the heavens and the earth!"" [Bearing this in
mind] it is certain that you will immediately acquire a feeling of
reverence and submissiveness for the awesomeness of Hashem, Blessed
be He, and be ashamed [to sin] before Him.

2

Also, while lying in bed you should realize before Whom you lay and as
soon as you awaken you should remember the kindnesses of Hashem,
Blessed be His Name, that were granted to you; that He returned your
soul to you. You committed it to Him faint and weary and it was
returned to you new and refreshed, enabling you to worship Hashem,
Blessed be His Name, with all of your capacity and serve Him the





entire day; because this is the essence of Man, as it is said in Scripture:
""They are new every morning how great is Your faithfulness."" This
verse teaches that every morning a person becomes a new creation, and
he should give thanks with all his heart to Hashem, Blessed be His
Name, for this (good fortune). While still in bed you should recite: I
give thanks to You, living and everlasting King for You have restored
my soul with mercy. Great is Your faithfulness. (Even though your
hands are not yet clean, you may say this, since the name of Hashem is
not mentioned.) You should pause slightly between the word chemlah
""with mercy,"" and the word, rabbah ""great.""
3

Yehudah son of Taima says: ""Be bold as a leopard, light as an eagle,
swift as a deer and strong as a lion to do the will of your Father in
heaven."" ""Bold as a leopard"" means, you should not be ashamed before
people who mock you for worshipping Hashem, Blessed be His Name.
""Light as an eagle"" refers to what the eye sees. This alludes to the
requirement to be swift to close your eyes to prevent the seeing of evil
because the sight of evil constitutes the beginning of sin. The eye sees
and the heart desires and the organs capable of action culminate the
sin. ""Swift as a deer"" refers to the legs, for your legs should run to do
good things. ""Strong as a lion"" is a reference to the heart, because true
valor in serving the Creator, Blessed is He, emanates from the heart. He
also states: ""Strengthen your heart to serve Him, and overpower your
evil inclination and defeat it as a hero triumphs over his enemy,
defeating him, and casting him to the earth.""

4

Therefore, it is imperative for a person to be strong as a lion.
Immediately upon awakening (and reciting the Modeh Ani prayer) you
should rise with alacrity for the service of the Creator, Blessed and





Elevated is He, before you are over-whelmed by your evil impulse with
various excuses not to rise, and be outsmarted and seduced in the
winter [with this argument]: ""How can you rise now so early in the
morning when the weather is so cold?"" Or, in the summer it will argue:
""How can you rise from your bed while you are still not satisfied with
enough sleep?"" or other similar claims. The evil impulse knows very
well the art of entrapping a person with all kinds of snares to prevent
him from rising. Therefore every sensitive person who fears and
trembles before the word of Hashem must triumph over the evil
impulse and not listen to it, even if it is extremely difficult because of
physical considerations or laziness. Your aim must be to fulfill the will
of the King of kings, the Holy One, Blessed be He. You should realize
that if you were called by any individual to participate in a business
transaction in which there is profit, or to collect a debt, or if someone
called with a plan to save your wealth from disaster, for example, if a
fire occurred in the city or something similar occurred, you certainly
would be quick to awaken immediately because of your concern for
your wealth and you would not act sluggishly. Similarly, if you would
need to go to the service of the king you would rise with alacrity and
not be sluggish lest you be denigrated. [Or you would rise with alacrity]
in order to find favor in the eyes of the king. How much more so
should this apply for the service of the King of kings, the Holy One,
Blessed is He, that you should be concerned to rise quickly and with
alacrity. Once you accustom yourself to this practice four or five times
you will no longer find it difficult, [as our Sages have said:] ""He who
makes an effort to purify himself is [Divinely] assisted in his efforts.""
5

If you are able to awaken and rise at midnight to recite the prayer of
Tikun Chatzos it is most praiseworthy, as it is said: ""Rise, cry out in the





night at the peak of the night watches"" etc. For the Holy One, Blessed
is He, [also] laments at that time, as it is said: ""Hashem from His high
place cries, and from the Dwelling Place of His Holiness He sends forth
His voice, as He cries for His Sanctuary."" And He says, ""Woe unto the
children that on account of their sins I destroyed My house, and I
burned My Sanctuary, and I exiled them among the nations."" If you
cannot rise at midnight, you should nevertheless exert yourself to rise
before daybreak, as said King David, may he rest in peace, ""I will
awaken the dawn,"" [He meant] ""I awake the dawn but the dawn does
not awaken me."" You may recite Tikun Chatzos, even after midnight
and then afterwards engage in Torah study according to your ability [or
capacity]. A lesson in Mishnah is preferable to any other study, (and by
so doing you will be worthy of [your] neshamah [soul] [as inferred from
the word] Mishnah which has the same letters as neshamah. If you are
not capable of this [studying Mishnah], you should recite Psalms and
Ma'amados and study works of ethics. A little learning or recitation
with concentration is better than a great deal without concentration.
Rabbi Chiyah taught: ""Whoever studies Torah at night the Divine
Presence is before him, as it is said: ""Rise, cry out in the night at the
peak of the night watches. Pour out your heart like water before the
Presence of Hashem."" This verse signifies that the Divine Presence is
before us at that time. It was also said by our Sages, of blessed memory:
""Whoever studies Torah at night is called a servant of Hashem, as it is
written: [Behold, Bless Hashem] all [you] servants of Hashem who
stand in the House of Hashem, during the nights."" During the short
nights when it is difficult to rise so early, you should at least endeavor
to rise while there is sufficient time to prepare yourself to go to the
synagogue to pray together with the congregation.



6


Chapters of the Psalms, and other sections of the Torah, Prophets and
Scriptures, in which all are not sufficiently fluent, must not be recited
by heart. Even someone who knows [them sufficiently] to recite them
by heart should be careful not to recite them by heart. However, a blind
person may recite them by heart.

7

We must object to the practice of those who recite the supplications of
the Ma'amodos and conclude: ""Blessed are You Hashem, Who listens to
prayer."" Rather, the proper conclusion is: ""Blessed is the One Who
listens to prayer,"" omitting the Name of Hashem. (See Turei Zahav, end
of Chapter 131).
"

When he arises from his bed in the morning a person is considered as a
newly created being, to serve the Creator, Blessed be His Name. He,
therefore, must sanctify himself and wash his hands from a vessel, [just]
as a Kohein washed his hands each day from the special basin [located
in the Temple] prior to his service. This washing is indicated in the
Scripture as it is said: ""I will wash my hands in purity and I will encircle
Your altar, Hashem, to proclaim a sound of thanks, etc."" There is also
another reason for this washing. When man is asleep, his holy soul
departs from him, and an unclean spirit comes and dwells upon his
body. When he awakens from his sleep, the unclean spirit departs from
his entire body except from his fingers, from which it does not depart
until he pours water upon them three times alternately. It is forbidden
to walk a distance of four amohs without washing the hands except in
cases of extreme necessity.




2


The first garment you should don is the small tallis in order not to walk
four amohs without fulfilling the mitzva of tzitzis. However, since your
hands are still unclean, you should not [yet] recite the berachah.

3

The procedure for washing hands in the morning is as follows: take the
vessel in your right hand and then place it in your left hand, and then
first pour on the right hand; and then take the vessel in your right hand
and pour upon the left hand. This procedure is repeated three times. It
is preferable to wash your hands until the wrist. However, in extreme
circumstances it is sufficient to wash them until the knuckles. You
should also wash your face in deference to the Creator, as it is said: ""For
in the image of God He created Man."" You should also rinse your
mouth because of the spittle in it, for you must pronounce the great
Name [of God] in holiness and purity. After this dry your hands and be
careful to dry your face well.

4

The hands must be washed only into a vessel. It is forbidden to derive
benefit from the water used for washing because of the foul spirit that
rests upon it, and [therefore] you should pour it in a place where people
do not walk.

5

Before washing you should not touch your mouth or nose, your eyes or
ears or anus, or food, or the place where blood was let; because the foul
spirit that rests upon the hands before washing is damaging to these
things.

6

It is preferable to be careful to wash your hands in the morning with
water poured from a vessel with human effort, similar to the washing of
hands before a meal (See Chapter 40). However, in extreme





circumstances, where you do not have suitable water and you wish to
pray, you may wash your hands from any [vessel], with any kind of
water, even if the water is not poured with human effort, and you may
still recite the berachah: al netilas yadayim. If there is a river close by it
is preferable to dip your hands in it three times, or even [to dip them]
in snow. However, if there is no water at all you may wipe your hands
on anything and recite the berachah, al nekiyas yadayim, and this is
sufficient [preparation] for prayer. Afterwards, upon finding water and
proper vessels you should wash your hands again properly, but without
pronouncing an additional berachah.
7

It is written: ""My soul, bless Hashem and all that is within me [bless]
His holy Name."" It follows that since a person needs to bless God with
all his innards, he is forbidden to recite the berachah until he cleans his
intestines from excrement and urine. In the morning when a person
awakens he probably has a need to relieve himself or at least to urinate;
therefore he should not recite the berachah over the washing of the
hands at the time of washing, but rather after he relieves himself. He
then washes his hands again and then recites the berachah al netilas
yadayim, and then the berachah of asher yatzar, followed by the berachos
on the Torah and then the berachah of Elokai neshamah.

8

If you awakened and washed your hands while it is still night, as
required, and remained awake until daybreak, or if you slept a second
time while it was still night, or if you slept during the day [long
enough] for sixty breaths (which is about one half hour), or if you are
awake all night [without sleeping long enough for sixty breaths,] in all
of these cases it is doubtful if there is a requirement to wash the hands





or not. You should, therefore, wash three times in the alternate manner
(as mentioned in paragraph 3) but without reciting the berachah.
9

These following situations require the washing of hands with water:
upon rising from bed [after sleeping], when leaving the lavatory or
bathhouse, after cutting nails or hair, after removing shoes, after sexual
intercourse, after touching vermin, or delousing a garment even
without touching vermin, after a head shampoo, or touching parts of
the body that are usually covered [out of modesty], after leaving a
cemetery, or walking after a funeral procession, or leaving a room in
which there was a corpse, or after blood-letting.
"
"1

It is written: ""You shall walk modestly with your God."" It is therefore
necessary to be modest in all your ways. Thus when putting on or
removing your shirt or any other garment from your body you should
be very careful not to uncover your body. You should put on and
remove the garment while lying in bed under a cover. You should not
say: ""I am in a private, and dark place."" ""Who will see me?"" Because the
Holy One, Blessed is He, Whose glory fills the entire world [sees] and
to Him darkness is like light, Blessed be His Name. Modesty and
shame bring a person to submissiveness before Him, Blessed be His
name.

2

We are not permitted to follow the ways of the gentiles, nor adopt their
styles in dress or in hair style or similar things, as it is said: ""You shall
not follow the ways of the gentile."" It is [also] said: ""In their ways you
shall not follow"" It is [also] said: ""Guard yourself lest you be ensnared





to follow them."" You should not wear a garment which is specifically
worn by them as a symbol of ostentation, such as a garment of highranking officers. For example, the Talmud states: that it is forbidden for
a Jew to be similar to them even in regard to shoelaces; if their practice
was to tie one way and the practice of Jews to tie another way, or if
their practice was to wear red shoelaces and Jews wear black shoelaces
because the color black indicates humility, submissiveness and modesty.
[In all such instances] it is forbidden for a Jew to deviate. From these
examples everyone should learn how to apply these standards to his
time and place. A garment designed for showiness or immodesty must
not be worn by a Jew, but rather his clothing should be made in a style
which suggests humility and modesty. The following is mentioned in
Sifrei: You should not say that since they go out with scarlet I shall go
out with scarlet, since they go out with kulsin (the word kulsin meaning
weaponry) I also shall go out with kulsin, because these practices are
indicative of arrogance and haughtiness which are not the heritage of
Jacob. Rather, our heritage demands of us to be modest and humble,
and not be influenced by the haughty. Similarly, any custom or statute
of which there is a suspicion of idolatrous intent or background should
be avoided by Jews. Similarly, you should not cut your hair or style
your hair as they do, but rather you should be distinct, in your clothing
and speech and all other endeavors just as you are distinct in your
perspectives and concepts. Similarly, it is said: ""I have set you apart
from the nations.""
3

You should not dress in extravagant clothing because such a practice
brings a person to haughtiness, nor should you wear tattered or soiled
clothing and appear repulsive in the eyes of people. Rather you should





dress in moderate, clean clothing. A person should even sell the beams
of his house in order to buy shoes for his feet.
4

Since we find that the Torah gives deference to the right hand: in regard
to service in the Temple and in regard to the thumb and big toe referred
to in the milu'im and purification of the metzora and in the mitzvah of
chalitzah; therefore in dressing and in other activities you should begin
with the right [hand or foot] as opposed to the left [hand or foot.]
When removing shoes or other clothing you should first remove the left
(because this shows respect for the right.) However, in regard to tying [a
lace] the left is held in higher esteem because we tie the tefillin on the
left [hand]. Therefore when you tie your shoes, you should first tie the
left. For example, with shoes that must be tied, put on the right shoe
without tying it, and then the left shoe and tie it, and then tie the right
shoe. This also applies to other clothing.

5

You should be careful not to put on two garments simultaneously
because this causes forgetfulness.

6

It is prohibited to walk four amohs or to utter sacred words with an
uncovered head. Also small children must be trained to cover their
heads in order to encourage them to have reverence for God, as it is
said of Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak: The mother of Rav Nachman bar
Yitzchak was told by Coldai, (""Coldai"" referring to astrologers), ""Your
son will be a thief."" [Upon hearing this] she did not permit him to
uncover his head. She said to him, ""Cover your head in order that there
be upon you the reverence of Heaven. (Maseches Shabbos, 156 b.)




7


You should not walk with an upright [haughty] posture and an
outstretched neck, as it is said: ""And they walked with outstretched
necks."" Nevertheless, you should not bend your head excessively, but
only moderately so that you will be able to see anyone approaching you
and also see where you are walking. (Rabbeinu Yonah in Sefer Hayirah).
From the way a person walks we can tell if he is wise and intelligent, or
if he is a fool and a boor. Thus said King Solomon in his wisdom: ""Also
in the manner that a fool walks his heart fails him, and he announces to
all his foolishness,"" thereby informing everyone that he is a fool.

8

You should be careful not to walk between two women. Similarly, two
men should not permit a woman to walk between them.
"
"1

You should accustom yourself to move your bowels in the evening and
in the morning because this habit is conducive to vitality and
cleanliness. If you are unable to do so you should walk four amohs and
sit and stand and sit [repeating this procedure] until you move your
bowels; or you should divert your thoughts from other matters. If you
delay going to the lavatory you transgress the prohibition of bal
teshaketzu. And if you delay urinating when you feel the urge you also
transgress the prohibition against bringing about sterility.

2

You should act modestly in the lavatory. You should not expose yourself
until you sit down. Also, then you should be careful to expose only
those parts of the body that are absolutely necessary in order not to soil
your clothing. You should be careful in this practice at night, just as





during the day. If you move your bowels in an open area around which
there are no partitions, you should position your body so that your
front faces southward and your back is toward the north or the reverse.
But to be positioned between east and west is prohibited. If there is a
partition you may move your bowels facing any direction if your back is
toward the partition. When urinating, you may face any direction. You
must not move your bowels in front of any person, including a gentile.
However, urinating is permissible, even during the daytime, even in the
presence of many people, when you must; because it is dangerous to
your health to refrain from urinating [when the need arises.]
Nevertheless, you should turn aside when doing so.
3

You should not move your bowels while standing and you should not
strain yourself more than necessary in order not to rupture the glands
of the rectum. You should not hasten to leave the lavatory until you are
sure that you no longer require it. When you urinate while standing be
careful that the urine doesn't splash on your shoes and clothing. You
should also be very careful not to hold in your hand the organ which
was circumcised. (See Chapter 151).

4

In the lavatory it is forbidden to think about Torah matters (as is stated
later, Chapter 5 par. 2). Therefore while you are there, it is best to think
of business affairs and accounts in order not to think of Torah or God
forbid indulge in sinful thoughts. On Shabbos, when it is forbidden to
think of business you should think of interesting events that you saw or
heard.

5

You should be careful to clean yourself well because if you have even the
slightest amount of excrement at the opening of the rectum you are





forbidden to utter any sacred word. (See Chapter 5 par. 3). You should
not clean yourself with your right hand because this hand is used to tie
the tefillin. Because of this reason you also should not clean yourself
with the middle finger of the left hand because the tefillin strap is tied
around it. A left-handed person should clean himself with his right
hand [because his left hand] is like everybody else's right hand.
6

After each defecation or urination, even of one drop, you should wash
your hands with water and recite the berachah, asher yatzar. If you
urinated or moved your bowels and forgot to recite the berachah, asher
yatzar and after urinating or moving your bowels again you
remembered that you did not recite the berachah you need to recite the
berachah only once. After drinking a laxative that induces diarrhea, and
you know that you will need the lavatory numerous times, you should
not recite the berachah until after all excrement has been passed.
"
"1

It is written: ""You shall cover your excrement because Hashem, your
God walks in the midst of your camp … your camp shall be holy and
there should not be seen in you any unclean thing."" From here our
Sages, of blessed memory, infer that wherever Hashem, our God walks
with us, meaning when we are engaged in a sacred matter such as
reciting the Shema, or prayers, or study, Torah, or the like, the place
must be holy. No uncovered excrement should be found there nor any
nakedness be visible in the presence of the person reciting the Shema or
praying.




2


Even to think of sacred things in a place with excrement or urine or
anything with a foul odor is forbidden unless it is covered, as it is said:
""You shall cover your excrement."" [In the case of urine] you may pour a
reviyis of water into the urine. It is immaterial if the urine was originally
in a vessel and you then poured water into it or if the water was in the
vessel first. (If the urine was in a trough specifically designated for it,
the mixture with water does not help as is explained later in par. 13).
For two urinations, we require two revi'iyos of water and so on. Even if
the urine was absorbed into the ground or in a garment, as long as there
remains some moisture from it, water must be poured over it.

3

If there is some excrement on the body, even if it is covered with
clothing it is forbidden to speak about sacred things as it is said: ""All
my bones shall say, Hashem who is like You?"" Therefore the entire body
must be clean. Some authorities are lenient in this matter, but it is
proper to follow the stricter opinion. If there is even the slightest bit of
excrement on the edge of the anus, even if it is covered, according to all
opinions it is of no avail, because in its original place it is more
loathsome. In the case of one ill with hemorrhoids, see Magen Avroham 76: 8 who
quotes from the Responsa of Radvaz, Volume III 315. The Magen Avraham concludes
that such a person is not required to do anything [in order to pray.]

4

Wherever there is any doubt concerning the existence of excrement or
urine we must take care not to utter a holy word until the place is
examined. We should not pray in a house in which there is filth in the
attic. (See Pri Megadim chap. 154 and Mishbetzos Zahav par. 1)




5


In the case of an infant—if others of his age are able to consume a
kezayis of grain even when cooked, in the time that an adult can eat a
quantity of bread equal to a p'ras, (in the Migdal Oz, authored by the
great Gaon, Yaavetz, it states that this refers to a child of one year) we
must distance ourselves from his excrement or his urine; and it is even
preferable to keep away from the excrement of an infant who is merely
eight days old.

6

We must keep a distance from the excrement of a person even when
there is no foul odor. This also applies to the excrement of a cat, weasel,
or from an Edomi hen, (a turkey). Excrements from other animals,
beasts, or birds probably do not have a foul odor and we need not
distance ourselves. However, if there is a foul odor, or a foul smelling
carcass, and anything with a foul odor caused by decay, or from a
chicken coup, we must keep a distance. We also must keep a distance
from foul-smelling water. [Standing] water in which flax or hemp was
soaked ordinarily omit a foul odor and we must distance ourselves from
them just as from excrement.

7

When excrement has become so dry that is crumbles when rolled, it is
considered as dust, provided it does not have a foul odor. However, if it
becomes frozen, since it can revert to its original state when the weather
becomes warm, it is still considered excrement. Excrement which is
covered with snow is considered covered.

8

How much must we distance ourselves? If the excrement is behind you,
you must keep a distance of four amohs from the spot where the foul
odor ceases. Even if you are unable to smell anything, you must keep





the same distance as if you actually did smell something. If it has no
odor it is sufficient to keep a distance of four amohs. If the excrement is
in front of you, you must remove yourself as far as the eye can see. Even
at night you must keep the same distance you would keep if it were
daytime. If the excrement is to your side the same strictness applies as if
it were in front of you, and you therefore should turn aside so that it
will be behind you.
9

If excrement is found, in a house in which a congregation prays even
though it is found behind the chazzan and is distant from him, four
amohs from the point at which the odor ceases, he nevertheless must
remain silent and wait until it is removed or covered, because it is
impossible that one of the congregation should not be within four
amohs from the place where the odor ceases, and this man is forbidden
to listen and to pay attention to what the chazzan is saying.

10

If you prayed and later found that the place contained excrement— if it
was a place that should have been inspected for possible excrement and
you neglected to inspect it, since the prayer of the Shemoneh Esrei is in
place of a Sacrificial offering, this Scriptural verse is applicable, ""The
sacrifice of the wicked is abominable"" and you are therefore required to
repeat the Shemoneh Esrei. Similarly, in regard to Shema which is a
Biblical command; since there is no problem of reciting a berachah in
vain you must again recite the Shema, without the berachos. Likewise
other berachos recited there, and even the Birkas Hamazon, need not be
repeated. If the place is one that did not require inspection for
excrement, you are not considered negligent, and even in regard to
Shemoneh Esrei your obligation is fulfilled. If urine is found, even in a





place where its existence should have been suspect, your obligation is
fulfilled even in regard to Shemoneh Esrei.
11

If a person flatulates, he is forbidden to utter anything holy until the
odor evaporates. If his neighbor flatulates, he also must wait untilthe
odor evaporates. But if he is engaged in studying Torah, it is not
necessary for him to wait for the odor to evaporate when it is emitted
from his neighbor.

12

In the case of a lavatory, even if it has partitions and has no excrement,
we must keep a distance from it [when praying]. Therefore, a seat in
which there is a hole under which a container is placed to retrieve
excrement, even if the container is removed and the hole is covered
with a board, this seat nevertheless is regarded halachically as a lavatory,
and must be removed from the house [i.e. room] or completely
covered. However, there are chairs designated for sitting and covered
with a cushion, and when the need arises the pillow is removed and the
chair is used as a toilet. The pillow is then returned to its place. In this
case we may be lenient.

13

A bed pan for holding excrement or a urinal, if they are made of
earthenware or wood are regarded as a lavatory. Even if they are clean
and have no foul odor, and even if water was poured into them or they
were inverted, it is to no avail. Even if they were placed under a bed, it
is of no avail (because our beds do not serve as partitions), rather they
must be removed from the house or covered. If they are made of metal
or of glass, if they are washed well and have no foul odor, there is no
need to keep a distance from them. With regard to the mouth of a hog,





since it pecks at excrement, it has the status of a bed pan. Even if it [the
hog] emerges from a river, the washing does not change its status.
14

In a bathhouse it is also forbidden to speak or think about sacred
matters. It is also forbidden to mention the specific Names of the Holy
One, Blessed is He, even in a secular language, (for example Gott in
German, or in any other language) in a bathhouse or in a filthy alley.
Similarly it is forbidden to extend shalom to your friend there, because
Shalom is the Name of the Holy One blessed is He. As it is said: ""And
he called it Hashem Shalom."" Regarding a person whose name is
Shalom, some authorities forbid calling him by his name in the abovementioned places. Others permit it since the intent is not the concept
of peace but merely to mention the name of that particular person. Our
practice is to be lenient. However, a God-fearing person should
preferably adopt the stricter view.

15

It is forbidden to speak words of Torah or other sacred words in the
presence of nakedness, whether your own or another's. Even a small
child's nakedness is included. (An exception is for the mitzvah of milah,
when a berachah may be recited in the presence of the child's
nakedness.) Even closing your eyes in order not see the nakedness does
not suffice, since it is in front of you, but you should turn your face and
body away from the nakedness.

16

With regard to the body of a woman, any place that is customarily
covered for modesty, of which a tefach is revealed, [is considered
nakedness]. The hair of a married woman should be covered, and if
part of her hair is revealed, it is in the same category as nakedness as far
as a man is concerned. There is no distinction between his wife or any





other woman. However, [when it is exposed] in the presence of another
woman, it is not considered nakedness. The voice of a woman while
singing, is also considered nakedness. Nevertheless, in unavoidable
circumstances when you hear women singing and cannot prevent it,
you should not refrain from reciting the Shema, prayers, or Torah.
Rather, you should concentrate intensely upon the sacred subjects in
which you are engaged, and pay no attention to their singing.
17

If your heart sees your own nakedness, even if your private parts were
covered, as when wearing a robe, it is also forbidden to recite any sacred
text. You must either wear trousers, which cling to your body, or put on
a belt, or place your arms against your robe, in order to create a
separation between your heart and your nakedness. A woman is not
required to do this.
"
"1

Before reciting a berachah you must be sure which berachah you are
required to recite, so that when you mention Hashem's Name which is
the principle part of the berachah, you will know how to conclude the
berachah. It is forbidden to do anything else while reciting a berachah.
Do not recite the berachah hurriedly but think of the meaning of the
words. The Sefer Chassidim states: ""When you wash your hands or
recite the berachah on fruit or on the performance of a mitzvah,—
berachos which everybody knows— you should direct your attention to
recite them in the Name of your Creator Whose goodness is bountiful,
Who granted you the fruit or bread for your pleasure, or commanded
you to perform the mitzvah. You should not recite the berachah
automatically, out of habit, spouting words from your mouth without





thinking of their meaning. On account of such practice Hashem's
anger was kindled, and He sent us word through the prophet, Isaiah,
saying: ""Because this people approaches [Me] [only] with their mouths
and honor Me [only] with their lips and their heart is distant from Me
and their reverence for Me is merely perfunctory."" The Holy One
Blessed is He said to Isaiah, See how the deeds of My children are
merely external and they adhere to them [only] as a person adheres to
and practices a custom of his forbearers; they enter My house and pray
to Me the designated prayers merely as a custom of their fathers but not
with their whole hearts. They wash their hands, and recite the berachah
over the washing and then break bread and recite the hamotzi, they
drink and recite the berachah out of habit. When they recite the
berachos they have no real intention of praising Me. Therefore, His
anger was fierce and He swore by His great Name to destroy the
wisdom of their Sages who know Him and still praise Him
perfunctorily, without sincerity as it is written thereafter: ""Therefore I
shall do yet more … and the wisdom of their Sages will be lost.""
Therefore our Sages warned us regarding this and said: ""Fulfill [your]
obligations for the sake of the Creator etc."" This concludes his [Sefer
Chassidim's] remarks. It is proper to accustom yourself to recite the
berachos aloud because the voice arouses concentration.
2

When you recite a berachah your mouth should be free of saliva nor
should anything else be in your mouth, as it is said: ""My mouth shall
be full of Your praises.""

3

It is forbidden to utter the Name of God in vain. Whoever utters the
Name of God in vain violates a positive commandment, as it is written:
""You shall fear Hashem, your God."" It is also written: ""If you will not





heed etc. to fear this glorious and awesome Name."" Included in the
concept of fear is not mentioning His great Name except in praise of
Him or when reciting a berachah whenever required, or when studying
Torah. You should fear and tremble when you mention the Name of
Hashem, Blessed Be His Name, but you should not utter it God forbid
in vain. This not only applies to the ineffable Name but includes all
Names that are ascribed to Hashem, Blessed be He. It is not only
forbidden in Hebrew but is forbidden in any language. He who curses
his friend or himself in the Name of Hashem, Blessed be He or in one
of the allusions to Hashem, (the allusions refer to the adjectives that are
used to praise the Holy One Blessed is He, e.g., the Great, the
Powerful, the Awesome, the Faithful, the Glorious, the Mighty, the
Valiant, the Strong, the Gracious, the Merciful, the Zealous, Prolonger
of Wrath, and Bestower of Kindness) in any language, incurs the
penalty of lashes. In our sinfulness many people are careless and say:
""God should punish him"" or something similar to that, thereby
violating a prohibition of the Torah. If one curses without using
Hashem's Name or without the allusion to Him or if the curse was
implied from something else that was said, for example: May that
person not be blessed by Hashem or a similar statement, even though
there is no penalty of lashes there is still a violation (see Choshen
Mishpat ch. 27). Similarly it is forbidden to write His Name Blessed be
He, in any letter, in any language. Many people mistakenly write His
Name, Blessed be He, in German or write the word, adieu which in
French means ""with God,"" and this constitutes a clear violation since
after a while the letter will be thrown away with trash. When the Name
of God is mentioned frequently, especially when mentioned
disdainfully, God forbid it causes poverty among Jews. Wisdom and




effort are required to halt this practice (See Urim there). When saliva
accumulates in your mouth, you should remove it and then say the
Name of Hashem, and not say the Name and then spit. Similarly, when
kissing the Torah, remove any saliva before kissing the Torah and not
afterwards. When you wish to mention the Name of Hashem you
should say the word Hashem, and not as the common people who say
Adoshem, because this reference is undignified when referring to
Heaven. (See Turei Zahav, Chapter 621).
4

You must be careful never to recite a berachah in vain God forbid, or
cause yourself to recite a berachah which is unnecessary. If you recited a
berachah in vain, or if you uttered the Name of Hashem in vain, you
should immediately say: Boruch sheim kevod malchuso le'olam va'ed
[""Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever.""]
If immediately after pronouncing Hashem's Name you remember that
the berachah is unnecessary, you should conclude [with]: lamdeini
chukecha, (teach me Your laws), which is a complete verse. Thus it is
considered as learning [Torah] and [the Name] was not mentioned in
vain. If you began the word Elokeinu [our God], and immediately recall
after saying Elokei and have not said the suffix nu you should conclude
by saying: Yisrael Aveenu meolam ve'ad olam [Israel our father forever
and ever] (which is also the syntax of a verse in Chronicles I, Chapter
29). Nevertheless you should also say: Boruch sheim kevod malchuso
le'olam va'ed (See Tzlach, Maseches Berachos, Page 39).

5

If you recited a berachah over water and heard there was a corpse in the
vicinity, and the custom in your community is to pour out the water in
the vicinity of the dead person, (as mentioned later in Chapter 194)
because such water is considered dangerous, nevertheless, since you





recited the berachah you should drink a bit of it so that the berachah
not be in vain, and do not worry about the health hazard, because
""One who performs a mitzvah will not suffer adverse consequence.""
(See later Chapter 109 par. 9). [However,] after drinking a bit of the
water you should pour out the rest.
6

With regard to all berachos (except for Birchas Hamazon which will be
elaborated upon, God willing in Chapter 44, par. 11), if you are in
doubt whether you said them or not, you should not repeat them.

7

A man must recite at least one hundred berachos each day. King David
instituted this obligation. A hint to this effect is found in Scripture: ""
[These are the words] of the man [David] who was raised high."" The
Torah: ""And now Israel, what does Hashem, your God request of you
but to fear Hashem etc."" Do not read the word mah, [what] but rather
read me'ah [one hundred] which refers to the hundred berachos which
will cause us to fear God, and to love Him, and constantly remember
Him through the berachos we recite. The curses in the book of
Deuteronomy number ninety-eight, and then it is stated: ""All sicknesses
and plagues etc."" bringing the total to one hundred. The hundred
berachos we recite each day shield us and save us from these curses. On
Shabbos and Yom Tov and on fast days which lack the hundred
berachos, we compensate by concentrating on the berachos recited by
the chazzan when he repeats the Amidah, and on the berachos recited
over the Torah reading and the reading of Maftir, after which we answer
Amein. Similarly berachos over foods add to the total.




8


Upon hearing any berachah made by someone, when you hear the
words: Baruch Attah Hashem, [Blessed are you Hashem] you should say:
Baruch Hu Uvaruch Shemo [Blessed is He and Blessed is His Name] and
when he completes the berachah you should say Amein. Amein means
it is true, and you should have in mind: ""The berachah which was
recited is true and I believe in its truth."" In the berachos which also
include prayer such as the berachos of the Shemoneh Esrei beginning
with Atah Chonein until Hamachazir Shechinaso Letzion and also the
berachah of Sim Shalom, you should have in mind these two things
when saying Amein: The berachah is true and that it be the will [of
God] that the prayers be fulfilled speedily. When answering Amein to
the Kaddish which is a prayer for the future, you should have in mind
only that the prayer be fulfilled soon.

9

If you are are reciting prayers where an interruption is forbidden, you
should not say Baruch Hu Uvaruch Shemo. Similarly if you hear a
berachah which you must hear to fulfill your obligation, so that it be
considered as though you recited it yourself, as for instance the
berachah over the Shofar, or the berachah over the Megillah, you should
not say Baruch Hu Uvaruch Shemo because this constitutes an
interruption in the middle of the berachah. (See Dagul Merevavah
Chapter 124). The laws of answering Amein when you are reciting
prayers where interruption is prohibited, will be explained, God
willing, later in special chapters. (Chapter 14 and Chapter 16).

10

You must be very careful to say the word Amein properly, and not say
the Aleph hastily nor ""swallow"" the Nun. You also should be careful not
to answer Amein before the one reciting the berachah has concluded





the entire berachah, because this is termed a hasty Amein. You also
should not delay the answering of Amein because this is an orphaned
Amein. Rather, immediately upon the conclusion of the berachah, you
should answer Amein. You should not raise your voice louder than the
one who recites the berachah, as it is said: ""Declare the greatness of
Hashem with me and let us exalt His Name together.""
11

You must not answer Amein to your own berachah (except in the
Birchas Hamazan, after the berachah to rebuild Jerusalem). Even if you
conclude a berachah simultaneously with the chazzan you should not
answer Amein. However, if you are reciting one berachah and the
chazzan is reciting another berachah and you conclude the berachah
simultaneously you should answer Amein to the berachah of the
chazzan. If you concluded the berachah of Yishtabbach, or the berachah
of Shomer Amo Yisroel La'ad, or the berachah Yehalleluchah, which
concludes the Hallel prayer, together with the chazzan you should also
answer Amein (Since according to numerous opinions even after your
own berachah in these instances you may answer Amein).
"
"1

There is a dispute among the authorities if the listener should answer
Amein after hearing [the berachah] La'asok B'divrei Torah. Some
maintain that this is not the conclusion of the berachah but rather that
Veha'arev nah etc. [please make pleasant] is a continuation of the above,
thereby making the entire text one berachah, and therefore you should
not answer Amein. Others maintain that this is the conclusion of the
berachah and Veha'arev nah begins another berachah and therefore you





should answer Amein. Therefore you should recite this berachah in an
undertone, so no one should hear it, and become involved in doubt.
2

The berachah, Hanosein lasechvi vinah, should not be recited until the
light of the day appears.

3

The berachah, Poke'ach ivrim, may be said even by a blind person,
because he also benefits from others who show him the way. If you
recited the berachah, Zokeif kefufim, before you recite the berachah,
Mattir asurim, You should not recite the berachah, Mattir asurim, since
it is included in the berachah of Zokeif kefufim, because the uprighting
of posture includes the free movement of the limbs.

4

After [the berachah], Hama'avir sheinah mei'einai usenumah mei'afapoi,
you should not answer Amein, because this is not the conclusion of a
berachah, for Vihi ratzon etc. [may it be Your will] is also part of this
berachah, and the actual conclusion of the berachah is Hagomeil
chasadim tovim le'amo yisrael.

5

[Even] If you are awake the entire night, in the morning, you should
recite all of the morning berachos, except for the berachah of Netilas
yadayim, which you do not recite. There is a question if the berachah of
Elokai neshamah, and the berachah Hama'avir sheinah, and also the
berachos on the Torah should be said, and therefore it is best to hear
them from another person and to answer Amein. (See Chapter 6: 9 and
Chapter 2: 8)

6

If you did not say all the morning berachos, before the morning prayers,
you may say them after prayers, except for the berachah of Netilas
yadayim, (some authorities hold that washing the hands in the morning





was instituted as a preparation for prayers; if so, after the prayers are
concluded there is no need for this berachah), and the berachah of
Elokai neshama (for which the obligation was fulfilled with the
berachah of Mechayei hameisim.)
7

Regarding the berachos on the Torah, if they were not said before the
morning prayers, there is a controversy among the authorities if they are
to be said after the prayers. Some maintain not to say them because
they were exempt with the saying of Ahava rabbah [With unbounded
love] (or Ahavas olam) [With an everlasting love] which are berachos
whose contents are also similar to those of the Torah berachos: ""Grant
into our hearts the ability to understand to listen, to learn, and to teach
etc."" And, others maintain that saying Ahava rabbah does not exempt
the reciting of the Torah berachos unless one learns after the Amidah
immediately without any interruption. Therefore, initially, you should
be careful to recite the Torah berachos before the morning prayers. In
the event, however, that you forgot to recite [the Torah berachos] before
morning prayers, you should study a Torah text immediately after the
Amidah. If you also forgot to do this, then because of doubt you are not
required to recite the berachos on the Torah.

8

If you are called to the Torah before having recited the berachos on the
Torah, if it is possible before the Aliyah to recite all the Torah berachos
and also to say at least one Torah verse, for example Yevarechecha etc,
[May He bless you], you should do so and then go to the Torah and
recite the berachos. If, however, it is impossible to follow this procedure
you should go to the Torah anyway. Since at the Torah you will have
recited Asher bachar banu etc, [Who chose us] you should say
afterwards, only the berachah of Asher kiddeshanu etc. [Who sanctified





us] and Veha'arev nah etc. [Please make pleasant] until Le'amo yisrael [to
His people Israel] and then say Yevarechecha etc.
"
"1

As soon as the day dawns, when a ray of light shines from the sun in
the east, since this begins the time when prayers may be said, (for if you
had prayed then, your obligation, would have been fulfilled) it is
forbidden to begin work or indulge in your affairs or set forth on a trip
before praying, as it is said: ""Righteousness will precede him and he will
set his footsteps upon the way."" ""Righteousness"" refers to prayer for we
declare the righteousness of our Creator, and then afterwards we may
set our footsteps on the road to our personal endeavors.

2

You may not eat or drink [before praying] as it is said: ""You shall not
eat anything with blood,"" [which means] You shall not eat before you
pray for your blood (life and welfare). Whoever eats or drinks and then
prays, of him, the Scripture says: ""And hast cast Me behind your back.""
Do not read gavecha [your back] rather gei'echa (your pride); said the
Holy One, Blessed is He,""After this person catered to his pride, he
accepted the yoke of Heaven."" It is forbidden even to drink coffee or
tea with sugar or milk before praying. An old or weak person who
cannot wait for his food until the time the congregation leaves the
synagogue, especially on Shabbos or Yom Tov when the prayers are very
prolonged, may pray the Shacharis service in his home, slowly, then
recite Kiddush and eat something. Afterwards he should go to the
synagogue and listen intently as the congregation prays the Shacharis
service, and then pray the Musaf prayers with them. [This is more





appropriate than permitting him] to drink coffee with sugar or
something similar without first accepting God's kingship. However, for
reasons of health, it is permissible to eat or drink before prayers, since
this is not an act of pampering one's ego. Similarly, one who is unable
to concentrate properly during prayer without eating or drinking, may
eat or drink if he wishes before praying.
3

Some [authorities] maintain that even if you arise at midnight it is
forbidden to taste anything before prayer and it is proper to follow this
stricter opinion. However, if you feel weak you may eat or drink
something to strengthen yourself for Torah [study].

4

Water, coffee, or tea without sugar or milk may be taken before prayers
even after daybreak because, there is no egotistic indulgence in doing
this. Even on Shabbos or Yom Tov when you are obligated to recite
Kiddush, you may drink these liquids before praying, without saying
Kiddush, because before prayers there is no obligation to recite Kiddush,
as Kiddush is said only at a meal and immediately prior to that meal.
Thus, since you may not eat before Shacharis prayers there is no
requirement of Kiddush.

5

[Before praying] It is forbidden to go to a friend to meet him, or greet
him with Shalom, or even to say good morning; to him as it is said:
""Withdraw yourselves from man whose breath is still in his nostrils;
because for what is he to be esteemed."" This means: what is his
importantce that you honor him before honoring Me? If you meet him
by chance, according to the strictness of the law, it is permissible to say
Shalom. However, it is proper to alter your usual form of greeting, in





order to remember that it is forbidden to engage in other matters before
praying.
6

It is even forbidden to begin learning Torah after daybreak. However, if
you are accustomed to go to the synagogue and there is no liklihood
that the time [for prayer] will elapse, it is permissible to begin learning.
Similarly one who studies with others and if they do not study now
they will not study later, it is permissible to study with them because
the collective merit of a group is very great. They must take care
however not to overlook the time for prayer.
"
"1

The mitzvah of tzitzis is very great for according to the Scriptures all
the mitzvos depend on it, as it is said: ""And you will look upon it and
you will remember all the mitzvos of Hashem."" The numerical value of
the word, tzitzis equals 600, and the eight fringes and five knots make a
total of 613. Therefore every Jew should endeavor to have a tallis katan
which he should wear the entire day. It should be [made] of white
sheep's wool measuring three quarters of an amah in length and a half
amah in width. Others maintain that it should be an amah by an amah.
Those who make the tallis katan, sewing its sides together [making it
like a shirt], should take care that both sides of the garment are left
open, i. e. the greater part of the visible sides are left open. Even hooks
may not be used to join the open parts. Also, every Jew should
endeavor to have a large garment with tzitzis [attached] to wear during
prayer. He should endeavor to have a beautiful garment. Similarly, all
mitzvos should be performed with as much splendor as possible, as it is
said: ""This is my God and I shall glorify Him,"" and we learn from this





be adorned before Him with mitzvos. You should take care to purchase
tzitzis from a trustworthy person to be sure that they were spun and
twisted specifically for the purpose [of tzitzis,] and according to the
prescribed laws. (The tzitzis) should also be adequately long.
2

If only a linen garment is available, in which it is prohibited to tie
tzitzis of wool because of the prohibition of sha'atneiz, according to one
opinion, the corners [of the garment] should be made of leather to
which woolen tzitzis can be tied. Others, however, dispute this view,
and maintain that this should not be done.

3

yourself bound tassels (tzitzis) on the four corners of your garment.""
Among the laws the Sages learned from this verse are:
which makes the garment fit for the fulfillment of the mitzvah. If, however, after
attaching the tzitzis there is something else to be done to complete the mitzvah then it

the ""corners."" It is considered the corner [when it is] no more than three thumb
breadths (agudlin) and not less than the distance between the thumb's middle knuckle
to the end of the nail from the edge of the garment.

The hole through which the tzitzah is inserted should be no further
than three thumb-breadths from the edge of the garment, whether
along its length or width. (Some maintain that these thumbs are
measured at the narrow part of the thumb, that is, at its tip, and it is
proper to follow this stricter [opinion] see Sha'arei Teshuva), because if
it is more than three thumb-breadths [away] it is not considered the




corner of the garment but [rather] the garment itself. If the hole was
made above three thumb-breadths, although upon tying the tzitzah and
drawing the knot, the garment is creased causing the hole to be
lowered, it is nevertheless invalid. If, after threading the tzitzah through
the hole which is above the prescribed distance, he widened the hole by
cutting it in order that the tzitzah hangs within three thumb-breadths
[of the edge], it is [still] invalid because Scripture states: ""You shall
make,"" and not [that] which is already made. Likewise, the hole should
not be closer to the garment edge, whether along its length or width,
than the distance from the middle knuckle of the thumb to the end of
the thumb nail, because less than this amount is also not considered the
corner but rather under the corner. If the hole was the proper distance
[from the edge] but by pulling the knot the garment edge shrank so
that there is no longer the proper distance, it is nevertheless valid. If
there are fringes on the garment edge and they are not woven into the
garment, it is questionable if they are included as part of these
measurements or not. Therefore, it is necessary to cut them before
attaching the tzitzis. Regarding the small tallis, some people have the
custom to make two holes next to each other similar to the vowel
tzeirei, and they thread the tzitzis through both holes so that they hang
on the garment towards the outside.
4

If at the time of tying the tzitzis the hole was at the proper distance, but
afterwards the hole tore slightly or the edge of the garment tore so that
the tzitzis are then less than the proper distance from the edge, it is not
invalid, because the Torah insists that the tzitzah be placed under the
corner only at the time of attaching [the tzitzis] as is stated in Scripture:
""They shall make for them tzitzis on the corners of their clothes etc.""
Nevertheless, it is preferable to make a hem around the hole and at the





edge of the garment so that it does not [tear and] diminish [the
distance to less than] the knuckle of the thumb [to the end of the nail].
5

The custom is to tie the tzitzis [into] five double knots so that between
them there will be four links. This [is done in the following manner:]
the four strings are inserted into the hole and are tied in a double knot
and are wound around seven times with the long string called the
shamash. Again a double knot is made and again [the string] wound
around eight [times] [with the shamash] [followed by] a double knot
and wound around eleven [times] [followed by] a double knot, and
wound around thirteeen [times] [followed by] a double knot. Since the
beauty of the tzitzis is the equal dimension of all its links, therefore, in
the first link, where the windings are few they should be a distance, one
from another, and in the second link they should be brought closer.
[This should] also [be done] in the third and fourth [links.] The proper
length for each tzitzah, that is from the first knot until the end of the
strings, should be at least twelve thumb-breadths. The preferable
adornment [would be] that all the links together should comprise a
third of the tzitzah and the hanging strings the [remaining] two thirds.
Therefore care should be taken that each link should be the width of a
thumb so that all of the links should total four thumb-breadths, and
the hanging threads should be eight thumb-breadths. If the tzitzis are
longer, then the links should also be made slightly longer. It is
preferable that all of the knots be made with the [same] four strings
[always remaining] on one side, with the [other] four strings [always
remaining] on the other side, so that each [individual] string is divided,
half on one side [of the four], and half on the other side.




6


If the strings were not cut from each other but, rather, one very long
string was taken and folded to make four [strings], and in this manner
inserted into the hole and then made into knots, and afterwards cut,
[separating them into individual strings,] it is invalid; this is based on
the verse in Scripture: ""You shall make tzitzis for yourself."" We infer
from this that you must make the tzitzis, and not tzitzis that come into
being, meaning: it is required that the tzitzis be valid when they are
attached to the garment. They may not be invalid at the time of
attachment and become valid [afterwards] through another action
which would cause them to be valid. This [entire procedure] is invalid.
Similarly if the tzitzah were made properly on another garment and
that garment tore, and you wish to place the tzitzah in the same way on
another garment, or even on this same garment, for example: if the
garment tore from the hole until the edge of the garment causing the
tzitzah to fall, and you want to put it back to its proper place and then
restitch the garment until the hole, this is also invalid because of Ta'aseh
velo min he'asui. Similarly, if you tied the tzitzis when the garment was
exempt from tzitzis, for example when most of the garment was sewn,
and afterwards you undid some stitches causing the garment to open
most of the way, and [as a result became] obligated to have tzitzis,
[then,] if the tzitzis remain as they were,they are invalid because of
Ta'aseh velo min he'asui. Rather,the tzitzis must be untied and then tied
again properly. The same applies in any similar circumstance.

7

Before putting on the tallis the tzitzis should be checked as to their
validity. You must also check the strings that go through the hole as
well as the shamashim (revolutions.) The strings should also be
separated so that they must not be entangled with each other. If you are





late in coming to the synagogue so that if you [take the time] to
separate the tzitzis and check them you will be prevented from praying
together with the congregation, you are not required to check them or
separate them.
8

All mitzvos require a berachah oveir la'asiyasan; that is, the berachah
must be made before the performance [of the mitzvah.] Immediately
after the berachah the mitzvah must be performed without any
interruption. Therefore, you should hold the tallis with both hands and
think consciously that the Holy One, Blessed is He, commanded us to
enwrap ourselves with tzitzis so that we remember to do all His
mitzvos, as it is said, [in Scripture:] ""And you will look upon them (the
tzitzis) and you will remember all the commandments of Hashem.""
While standing recite the berachah lehisa'teif ba'tzitzis (with the vowel
pasach under the beis.) You should then immediately cover your head
[with the tallis] so that the tallis extends below the mouth, and then
bring the corners [of the tallis] up to your neck and wrap yourself in the
manner of the Arabs. You should remain standing like that for [the
length of time] it takes to walk four amos and recite the verses: Mah
Yakar etc. After this you may remove the tallis from your head. You
should take care not to drag the tzitzis along the floor for [this would
constitute] disrespect for the mitzvah. Therefore, you should lift them
(the tzitzis), and you may tuck them into your belt.

9

The berachah over the tzitzis is recited only during the daytime and not
at night. It is preferable not to recite the berachah over the tzitzis until
the [light of ] day is sufficient to distinguish between blue and white. If
you put on the small tallis while it was still night, and did not recite the
berachah, or if you put it on before your hands were washed and thus





did not recite the berachah, then, when reciting the berachah on the
large tallis you should have in mind that this berachah [should also
include] the small tallis. If you do not have a large tallis, and you put
on the small tallis during the day, and your hands were [already]
washed, you should recite the berachah: Al mitzvas tzitzis on it (the
letter vav with the vowel pasach). If you put it on while still unable to
recite the berachah, then, afterwards, when daylight arrives and your
hands are washed, you should take the tzitzis in your hands and recite
the berachah: Al mitzvas tzitzis. If you slept while wearing a small tallis
you do not recite a berachah after [daybreak] at all; but, [should
instead,] when reciting the berachah on the large tallis, have intention
to include [the small tallis].
10

If you take off your tallis with the intention of putting it on again
immediately, even if you did so for the purpose of going to the lavatory,
when you return and put it on again you do not recite the berachah
over it (the tallis). (Since it is permissible to enter the lavatory with it [i.
e. even while wearing a tallis] it is,therefore, not considered an
interruption). However, if your intention was not to put the tallis on
again immediately, and then you changed your mind and did put it on
again, you must recite the berachah over it. If your tallis fell off
accidentally, [then] if part of it remained on your body, regardless if
most of it fell, as long as part of the mitzvah remained upon you you
are not required to repeat the berachah when you readjust [the tallis].
However, if none of the tallis remains on your body, although you are
holding it in your hand, [then] since no part of the mitzvah remains on
your body, for the mitzvah is not to hold the tallis in your hand, but for
the body to be wrapped in it, you must, therefore, say a berachah when
you put the tallis on again. If this happens to you during prayers at a





point when you are not permitted to interrupt, you should not recite
the blessing then but wait [instead] until you are permitted to recite the
berachah, [at which point] you should grasp the tzitzis in your hand
and recite the berachah.

The halachah states that ""One who borrows without the owner's knowledge is
considered a thief"". (Bava Basra 88a). Here we find an exception to this law. When
the borrower's purpose is to perform a mitzvah with the object, and the owner will
not incur any loss, then it is assumed that the owner would be pleased and the
borrower may make use of the object.
Some go so far as to say that even where the owner explicitly objects, use may be made
of his tallis. (Responsa Maharsham Vol. I 29) Others, however, maintain that if the
owner is known to be one who would usually object then it is not permitted to use
the article without specific permission (Mishnah Berurah 14: 13 ). Still others go even
further and hold that nowadays everyone is assumed to mind and specific permission
must be received (Aruch Hashulchan 14: 11).

It is permissible to borrow someone's tallis on an irregular basis, even
without his knowledge, and use it for prayers and to recite a berachah
over it, because it may be assumed that one is pleased that a mitzvah is
performed with his property, if it is at no loss to [the owner]. However,
[the article] may not be removed from the house in which it was placed
because the owner may object to that. If the [borrower found] the tallis
folded he should replace it folded, but on Shabbos he may not fold it
[and it may be assumed] that since the reason for his not folding it is
due to a Shabbos restriction, the owner would not object. One who
borrows a tallis from another only for the purpose of going up to [read
from] the Torah, there is a halachic question if the berachah is recited.
Therefore, you should specifically intend not to acquire the tallis,
thereby, according to all opinions, you are not required to recite a




berachah. However, on the congregation's tallis, even if you take it only
for going up to the Torah, you are required to recite a berachah, because
it is considered as if it were yours.
12

When the Torah refers to ""wool"" or when the Poskim do so they
[usually mean] sheep's or ram's wool. A pious person should not recite
the berachah over a tallis [in which] the warp [threads] are made of
wool and the woof threads are made of cotton, silk or the like; or the
reverse, [that is,] that the woof threads are made of wool and the warp
threads are of another material, because some Poskim maintain that
even tzitzis made of wool only exempt a garment made of the same
material. Similarly, over a tallis made of silk and the tzitzis are made of
wool, a berachah is not said, but, [rather,] you should first recite the
berachah over a woolen tallis and enwrap yourself with it and remove it
(the woolen tallis), and then, enwrap yourself with it (the silk tallis).
However, if the tzitzis [of the silk tallis] were also made of silk you may
recite a berachah over it (the tallis,) (Tzitzis of silk are not common in
our countries because tzitzis must be spun for the purpose of tzitzis). If
the tzitzis were partially made of silk and partially of wool it is even
worse (more questionable) and (tzitzis) should not be made in this
manner.

13

A tzitzah from which a string tore from the four strings (that are folded
over to form eight strings), and enough remained from it to allow the
tying of a bow, that is, four thumb breadths, or if two strings tore but
each had four thumb-breadths left and the other two strings remain
complete with the prescribed size, it [the tzitzah] is valid. However, if
three of the tzitzis strings tore, even if there remains from each (string)
four thumb-breadths and the fourth string is complete, or if the tear





was even in only one thread and there did not remain four thumbbreadths, even though the other three threads are complete, it is
nevertheless invalid (unless it is an emergency). Therefore, if one string
tears from the eight strings which are hanging, even if it tore completely
up to the links it is certainly valid since this one string is only half [of a
larger] string, and there is still [enough left] in the other half to tie a
bow and even more. If two strings tore and there did not remain in
each one four thumb-breadths, [then] if there is the possibility that
these two strings are [really parts of ] one string, then the tzitzah is
invalid. However, if it is certain that they are from two separate strings,
for example, if at the time of tying them he was careful to always tie the
four ends on one side with the four ends of the other side, (as I've
already mentioned at the end of paragraph five) and now there is a tear
in two of the ends located on one side of the knot; in this particular
case it is certain that the tears were in two separate strings, and since
there still is in each string the amount of four thumb-breadths and even
more on the second side of the knot, and the other two strings are
complete, the tzitzah is valid. If one string tears at the point where they
hang in the hole the tzitzah is invalid. We mentioned that if one string
tears, and there remains a [sufficient] amount to tie a bow, that the
tzitzah is valid, this is so only if at the time of making [the tzitzis] all of
the strings were the proper length, except that afterwards they tore.
However, if at the time of making the tzitzis, there was even only one
string that was slightly shorter than the prescribed length the tzitzah is
invalid.
14

The strings of the tzitzah must be twisted and if any string becomes
unravelled from its twistedness then any unravelled part is considered as
if it were cut off and as if it does not exist.




15


Please refer to preface to para. 3 where the rule of Ta'aseh velo min he'asui was
discussed. Here we find another situation where the problem arises:
A large tallis with a seam down the middle whose tzitzis are validly attached is
separated at the seam for the purpose of facilitating the handling of the tallis during
laundering or mending. We, thus, have ""two"" taleisim (the Yiddish plural of tallis)
with two tzitzis each. We are now faced with a problem—sewing the two halves
together again would result in validating the tallis for the mitzvah through an act not
done directly to the tzitzis. Thus: Ta'aseh velo min he'asui. The author here proposes a
solution to the problem.

This paragraph deals with a tallis that had tzitzis [attached] and was
divided into two [halves] as is common with many of our taleisim, that
are sewn together from separate sections. Occasionally [the sections] are
separated in order to launder it, or to mend it, and then is restitched.
Since there is usually enough left in each section to enwrap a person, it
is sufficient to remove two of the tzitzis from any section and after
restitching the tallis to retie the tzitzis. However, if each section is not
large enough to enwrap a person, he must [first] remove all of the tzitzis
(because when the sections were separated each part is exempt from the
mitzvah of tzitzis, and when they are later reattached and require tzitzis,
then, if the original tzitzis remain the tallis is invalid because of Ta'aseh
velo min he'asui as [was mentioned] previously in paragraph six). If in
one section there is a sufficient amount [left] to enwrap [a person], and
in the other section there is not enough to enwrap [a person], he should
[then] remove the tzitzis from the part that does not have enough to
enwrap a person.
16

If the corner [of the tallis] was either cut or torn and became
completely separated from the tallis, and the area of that piece is less





than three thumb-breadths by three thumb-breadths, there are those
who maintain that this piece, even after it is resewn properly to the
tallis, is invalid for attaching tzitzis to it. [The reason for this is] since
there is not [in this piece] three thumb-breadths by three thumbbreadths it is not considered to be a ""garment"" and even if it is attached
to the tallis it is still considered as separated. We should adhere to this
strict view. However, if the piece is not separated completely from the
tallis, as long as it remains slightly attached, resewing it [to the tallis] is
sufficient [for the piece] to be considered a part of the tallis, and the
tzitzis that will be attached, after resewing [the piece], are valid. The
custom is to sew a piece of cloth (three by three) on the corners of the
tallis because in many garments, even if they are new, there are pieces of
cloth attached that are less than three agudlin by three agudlin. We,
therefore, sew at the place that we attach the tzitzis, a piece of cloth,
three agudlin by three agudlin.
17

Rashi's opinion(Maseches Menachos 41a) is that any thread used in the stitching at the
corner of the garment should be of material other than the tzitzis. This is because
there is concern that one may leave some of the sewing thread dangling from the
corner and then combine it with three other strings for tzitzis. Since his original intent
for this thread was for stitching and not for tzitzis, it cannot become part of the tzitzis
merely by his decision to consider it so. This constitutes Ta'aseh velo min he'asui.

Some authorities hold: that on the entire area of the corner, which is
eligible for attaching the tzitzis, that is, from after the length of the first
thumb knuckle, from the edge of the tallis until a length of three
thumb-breadths, there should not be any stitches whatsoever with a
thread that may be used in the making of tzitzis for this particular tallis;
for example, if the tallis, was made of linen, one should not sew there
with linen threads, but [use] only silk threads or the like. [Likewise] if




the tallis is silk it should not be sewn with silk threads. If the tallis was
made of wool it should not be sewn with woolen threads but with
silken threads or the like. It is preferable to adhere to this strict view
also in regard to the hem that is made around the hole to reinforce it
(the hole). All of the above, however, applies only to white thread but
with colored threadthere is no reason for concern.
18

If you wish to remove the tzitzis from the tallis in order to reattach
replacement tzitzis which are more beautiful, or because one of the
threads tore and you wish to attach complete ones, although the
original tzitzis are still valid, it is nevertheless permissible [to remove
them] since you are not nullifying the tallis from the mitzvah of tzitzis.
On the contrary, you will be attaching more beautiful tzitzis.
[However,] you should be careful not to throw the original [tzitzis] into
a disrespectful place.

19

Even tzitzis that have become invalid and were removed from the tallis
should not be thrown into the trash because it shows disrespect for the
mitzvah. Some people are careful to place them in a holy book and to
use them as a bookmark; for since they were used to perform a mitzvah
at one time, let them be used for another mitzvah. Likewise, a tallis that
has aged and is no longer worn as a mitzvah, should not be used in a
disrespectful way.

20

It is important to note that wearing a four-cornered garment without valid tzitzis is
not merely a failure to perform a mitzvah but, rather, a transgression, because the
Torah prohibits the wearing of a four-cornered garment without tzitzis.

If you go to a Synagogue on Shabbos and discover that a tzitzah of your
tallis has become invalid and you are unable to borrow another tallis





and you are embarrassed to sit without a tallis, then, since it is not
possible for you to tie another tzitzah on this day, therefore for the sake
of your dignity you are permitted to wear the tallis as is but you should
not recite the berachah. This is applicable only if you were unaware
before Shabbos that [the tzitzah] became invalid, but if you knew
before Shabbos that it became invalid you are forbidden to wear the
tallis, since you should have fixed it the day before.
21

If a garment that requires tzitzis is worn without tzitzis, this constitutes
transgression of a positive command. We must be careful about certain
garments that are made with four corners; one corner must be cut so
that it becomes rounded. However, if the corner was merely folded and
sewed it so that it appears round it is not sufficient, because as long as it
was not cut, it is still considered part of the garment. Great is the
punishment for one who negates the mitzvah of tzitzis. One who is
scrupulous in this mitzvah will be worthy to behold the Divine
Presence.

"1

The mitzvah of tefillin is also a very precious mitzvah, for the entire
Torah is similar to tefillin, as it is said: ""In order that the Torah of
Hashem be in your mouth."" And someone who does not put on
tefillin, is reckoned among the transgressors of Israel who sin with their
bodies, [i. e., tefillin are worn on the arm and head]. Similarly one who
puts on invalid tefillin, not only fails to perform the mitzvah, but he
also recites many berachos in vain, which is a grave sin. Therefore, you
should be careful to purchase tefillin from an expert, and God-fearing
scribe. Similarly, the tefillin straps should be purchased from a





trustworthy person to be sure that the leather was processed for the sake
of tefillin, from hides of a kosher animal. But among our many sins is
the temptation to purchase tefillin and tefillin straps from anyone who
sells them cheaply, [even though] their tefillin are invalid. Every Godfearing person should consider this: if he is concerned to select proper
material for his clothing and utensils, then certainly he should not
economize and worry about the cost when buying articles to serve God,
blessed is His Name. You should therefore be careful to purchase [only]
those tefillin that are definitely kosher, even though they cost more. You
should take care that they are always in proper order, and that the batim
and straps are always black. You should smear the straps with oil
regularly to ensure their blackness, (but they should not be smeared
with the oil of a fish called ""fishtron"" because this oil is derived from a
non-kosher fish.) If the tefillin were damaged even slightly or if the
stitches tore, you should immediately consult a rabbinic expert to
determine their validity. You should be especially careful regarding the
corners [of the batim] and specifically to the shel rosh because they
frequently rub against objects which cause dents making them invalid.
And also very frequently when tefillin become old, a separation appears
in the upper hide of the shel rosh making it invalid. You should be
greatly concerned about all of these matters. All who are careful [in the
observance] of the mitzvah of tefillin and treat them with sanctity, not
speaking of trivial or secular matters when wearing them, will have his
days lengthened, and is assured of a share in the World to Come, as it is
said: ""Hashem is upon them (for they carry upon themselves the Name
of Hashem in the tefillin) and they shall live; and in all these things will
my spirit live, and You will give me health and give me life."" The word,
tefillin, means judgement and admonition (and therefore the lamed has




a dot in order to compensate for the second lamed which is missing)
because the tefillin are testimony and proof that the Divine Presence
dwells upon us, as is stated in Scripture: ""All the peoples of the earth
shall see that the Name of Hashem is called upon you etc."" Our Sages,
of blessed memory, explain that this refers to the shel rosh upon which is
formed the letters shin of Hashem's Name, Shadai. And therefore you
should not cover the shel rosh completely with the tallis.
2

The time for putting on the tefillin in the morning [begins from the
time] when you are able to see and recognize a neighbor with whom
you are slightly familiar at a distance of four amos. The tefillin should
be put on after you put on the tallis. The reason for the precedence of
the tzitzis over tefillin is because the mitzvah of tzitzis is performed
more frequently, being performed during weekdays as well as Shabbos
and Yom Tov, whereas the mitzvah of tefillin is performed only during
weekdays. [And] the rule is that in choosing between a regularly
performed mitzvah, and one that is not performed [as] regularly, the
regularly performed mitzvah takes precedence. However, if you happen
to touch the tefillin first even though they are still inside their bag, you
must put them on first and then enwrap yourself with the tallis, because
the rule is that a mitzvah must not be passed by as it is written: ""You
shall watch the matzos,"" which may also may be read as the mitzvos,
[that is, when the opportunity to do] a mitzvah presents itself, do not
let it sour by delaying its fulfillment.

3

It is written: ""It shall be a sign upon your hand."" Since the word
Yadecha is written with a [superfluous] hei, our Sages of blessed
memory teach: that this means yad keiha or weak hand referring to the
left hand which is weaker and feebler. The tefillin should be placed on





the elevated part of the muscle as it said: ""Place these words of Mine
upon your hearts,"" which means it shall be put opposite the heart, and
therefore you should place the tefillin there and incline it slightly
toward the body, so that when you bend your arm down, the tefillin
will be opposite your heart. Although regarding the shel rosh it is
written: ""Between your eyes,"" our Sages of blessed memory knew from
sacred tradition that this does not mean literally ""between your eyes""
but, rather, [on the head] above the space between your eyes. And the
proper place is from where the hair begins to grow, and this place
extends to the end of the spot where a baby's scalp is soft. This means
that the lower edge of the tefillin should not be lower than the place
where hair begins to grow, and the upper edge of the tefillin which is
above [on the head], should not be higher than the place where the
scalp of a baby is soft. Great care must be taken that the tefillin should
rest on its proper place. If you place the shel rosh [so that] even a small
part is on the forehead where hair does not grow or even if you place
the entire shel rosh on the place where hair grows but it is moved to the
side and is not between the eyes, the mitzvah is not fulfilled, and the
berachah is in vain. The knot [in the strap] should be placed opposite
the tefillin at the back of the head above the nape of the neck, which is
the base of the skull where hair grows, which is opposite the face; and it
should not incline to either direction. The strap should be secure on the
head. When the bayis and its base are exceedingly wide it is difficult to
maintain their tightness, and it is therefore, urgent to be most careful in
this matter.
4

The tefillin must be put on while standing. You should not shake the
tefillin out of the bag, because this is disrespectful to the mitzvah, but
you should take them out with your hand. You first put on the shel yad





and before you tighten the knot recite the berachah: lehani'ach tefillin
(the letter hay has the vowel kametz and the letter lamed of the word
tefillin has a dot in it). You then tighten the knot and wind the strap
around your arm seven times, and then immediately put on the shel
rosh. Before tightening it on your head recite the berachah: al mitzvas
tefillin (the letter vav has the vowel pasach). You then tighten the shel
rosh and say the verse: Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom
is forever and ever. The reason it is necessary to say: Blessed [is His]
Name, Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever, is because there is
some doubt regarding the [second] berachah, and because there is a
doubt regarding this berachah there is consequently also a doubt if one
who hears the berachah should answer Amein or not. Therefore, it
appears to me that it is preferable to recite this berachah in an
undertone. After putting on the shel rosh coil the strap of the shel yad
three times around the middle finger, once on the middle section and
twice on the lower section.
5

Even if you happen to take the shel rosh from the bag first, you must
pass by this mitzvah and put the shel rosh down, cover it with
something, and put on the shel yad first. Since the precendence of the
tefillin shel yad over the tefillin shel rosh is ordained in the Torah, as it is
said: ""And you shall bind them for a sign upon your arm and they shall
be totafos between your eyes,"" we are therefore not concerned with
passing over a mitzvah in this case.

6

Nothing must intervene between the tefillin and the flesh, whether in
regard to the tefillin of the arm [shel yad] or to the tefillin of the head,
[shel rosh], but short hair does not constitute a separation, because it is
normal to have it. However, people who grow long waves of hair, beside





the fact that it is detestable and arrogant, which in itself is a
transgression, it also causes a transgression regarding wearing the
tefillin, since when the hair is excessively long it is considered an
imposition [between the head and the tefillin].
7

Care should be taken that the knot of the shel yad should not be moved
away from the bayis (and even when the tefillin are in their bag you
should be careful about this) and the letter yud of the knot should
always be facing the heart. The base into which the strap is inserted
should be above and the bayis itself should be below. In extreme
circumstances, for example, a left-handed person who wears tefillin on
his right arm, and now has no other tefillin except those borrowed from
someone who wears them on his left arm (and similarly the converse)
and he is unable to change the knot, then if he wears the tefillin in this
manner, with the base upward and the bayis downward, the yud and the
knot will face outward. Therefore in these circumstances he may invert
the tefillin and put it on with the base downward and the bayis upward,
in order that the yud and the knot face the heart.

8

It is forbidden to talk between putting on the shel yad and the shel rosh.
Even gesturing with the eyes or snapping the fingers is forbidden, for it
is said: ""It shall be for you a sign upon your hand and a remembrance
between your eyes."" This remembrance requires the instantaneous
putting on of the shel rosh after the shel yad, in order that there be one
continuum for both of them. Even if you hear Kaddish or Kedushah,
you may not interrupt but rather remain silent and concentrate on
what the congregation is saying. However, if you hear someone reciting
the berachah lehani'ach tefillin you may respond with Amein, since the
response of Amein is an affirmation that you believe in the mitzvah of





tefillin, and this is considered one continuum. Regarding the tefillin of
Rabbeinu Tam it is likewise forbidden to interrupt between putting on
the shel rosh and shel yad; but you may interrupt for Kaddish and
Kedushah.
9

If by error you interrupted, move the shel yad a bit and repeat the
berachah lehani'ach tefillin, and tighten the knot. After that put on the
shel rosh, and recite the berachah. If the interruption was necessary to
the mitzvah of tefillin you are not required to repeat the berachah over
the shel yad.

10

Have in mind when putting on the tefillin, that the Holy One, blessed
is He, commanded us to put on tefillin which contain four sections of
the Torah in which are written the Oneness of Hashem's Name, blessed
is He, and the Exodus from Egypt. [The tefillin are put] on the arm
opposite the heart, and on the head opposite the brain, in order that we
remember always the miracles and wonders He did for us, which teach
us of His Oneness, and His power and dominion over the heavenly and
earthly worlds to do with them as He wills. [It also teaches us] that we
must subject to Him the soul which resides in the brain, and also the
heart, which is the source of desire and thoughts. By so doing, we will
remember the Creator and restrain our indulgences, and fulfill [that
which is written:] ""And you will not turn aside after your hearts and
after your eyes."" Therefore, it is written in the tefillin: ""Between your
eyes.""

11

The tefillin of the arm and the head are two separate mitzvos and are
not prerequisites for each other. Therefore if you have only one of them
or because of a particular situation you are able to put on only one of





them, you must put that one on. If you put on the tefillin of the arm
you recite only the berachah: lehani'ach tefillin. And if you put on the
tefillin of the head you recite over it the berachos: lehani'ach tefillin and
also al mitzvas tefillin, and then say: Blessed [is His] Name Whose
glorious kingdom is forever and ever.
12

A completely left-handed person, although he became left-handed
[only] through habit, nevertheless, must put the tefillin on his right
hand which is equivalent to everyone's left. If he performs all activities
with his right hand except that he writes with his left hand or vice
versa, the hand with which he writes is considered his right hand and
he therefore puts the tefillin on the other hand. An ambidexterous
person puts the tefillin on his left arm. Similarly, a man not born lefthanded at all, but later trained himself to write with his left hand, but
performs all other activities with his right hand, must put the tefillin on
his left hand.

13

The prescribed width of the tefillin straps, whether of the shel rosh or
the shel yad, cannot be less than the length of a barley kernel. The
prescribed length for the shel rosh, for both right and left straps [is that
it be long enough] to reach until the navel or slightly above it. Some
authorities maintain that the right strap should extend until the
circumcision, (Shimusha Rabbah), and it is proper to follow the stricter
view as the best way to fulfill the mitzvah. The strap of the shel yad
must be long enough to tighten the bayis to the muscle, and to make
seven coils around the arm and three coils around the middle finger,
with enough left to tighten it. If the strap breaks, whether of the shel
rosh or the shel yad, you should consult a rabbinic authority.




14


Care should be taken that the black side of the straps face outward. If it
happens that the straps become inverted around your head or around
the muscle of your arm so that the white side faces outward, you must
either fast or redeem yourself by giving charity. Similarly, if the tefillin
fall to the ground when they are not in their bag, you must also fast,
but if they fall while in their bag, you need not fast but you should give
something to charity.

15

If you remove the tefillin because you need to go to the lavatory, when
you return and put them on you must again recite the berachos.
However, if you are in the middle of the berachos of shema, that is from
the berachah of yotseir or and further, you should not interrupt by
reciting the berachos over the tefillin, but put them on without reciting
the berachos, and following the Shemonah Esrei you should move them a
bit and then recite the berachos.

16

As long as you are wearing tefillin your attention must not be diverted
from them even for a moment, except while praying the Amidah and
while studying Torah. It is forbidden to eat a regular meal while
wearing tefillin, but eating a snack [while wearing] tefillin is
permissible; but taking even a short nap while wearing tefillin is
forbidden.

17

You must touch the tefillin each time you think of them because by
doing so you will not have your thoughts diverted from them. You
should first touch the shel yad and then the shel rosh. It is a beautiful
custom to touch the tefillin when you mention their mitzvah during
the reading of Shema. When you say: ""You shall bind them for a sign





upon your hand,"" you should touch the shel yad and then kiss [your
hand] and when you say ""They shall be for totafos between your eyes,
you should touch the shel rosh and then kiss [your hand].
18

We may elevate a holy thing to a higher level of sanctity but not
diminish its level of sanctity. The tefillin shel rosh is more sacred than
the shel yad because the shel rosh is composed of four compartments and
also the letter shin; and therefore the strap that was part of the shel rosh,
may not be used for the shel yad, but the strap of the shel yad may be
used for the shel rosh. Similarly, if the strap of the shel yad tears above
the knot and you wish to reverse it and make the knot on the lower end
of the strap, it is forbidden; but you must remake the knot on that end
of the strap where the tear occurred. The same applies to the strap of
the shel rosh. It is forbidden to reverse that which was inside the knotted
area and remake it so that it is outside the knotted area. The same is
true of a bag made to hold tefillin and in which tefillin had actually
been held; it is subsequently forbidden to use this bag for any secular
purpose.

19

The tefillin should not be removed until after the kedushah of uva
letzion when we say: ""May it be Your will that we keep Your statutes.""
In communities where it is customary that on the day the Seifer Torah is
read, the Seifer Torah is not returned until after the kedusha of uva
letzion, the tefillin should not be taken off until the Seifer Torah is
returned to the Ark. A mnemonic for this order is: ""Their king will pass
in front of them and Hashem will be at their head."" On a day a
circumcision is performed the tefillin should not be removed until after
the circumcision. On Rosh Chodesh the tefillin are removed before the
Musaf Amidah. On the intermediary days of Sukkos, everyone removes





the tefillin before Halleil. On the intermediary days of Pesach the
congregation removes them before Halleil and the chazzan after Halleil.
20

The tefillin are removed while standing. You should unwind the coils
from the middle finger and two or three coils from the arm. The shel
rosh is removed first and then the shel yad because it is written ""They
shall be for totafos between your eyes."" Since it says ""They shall be"" in
the plural tense, our Sages of blessed memory, elicit that as long [as the
shel rosh] is between your eyes, both tefillin should be on you.
Therefore, you put on the tefillin shel yad first and remove the shel rosh
first, so that whenever the shel rosh is on you, the shel yad should also be
on you. You should remove the shel rosh with the left hand which is the
weaker hand in order to demonstrate that you are reluctant to remove
them, because ideally the mitzvah is to wear the tefillin the entire day;
but because our bodies are not always clean we remove them
immediately after prayers. You should not remove the tefillin in the
presence of the Seifer Torah nor in the presence of your rebbe but you
should turn aside [and remove them]. It is a custom ordained by our
Sages to kiss the tefillin when putting them on and taking them off.
You should not remove the tallis until after taking off the tefillin.

21

The tefillin should be placed inside their bag in a way that you will be
certain the next day to take out the shel yad first. However, you should
not place the shel yad on top of the shel rosh because the shel rosh is
more sacred than the shel yad, but they should be placed side by side.
The tefillin bag should be placed inside the tallis bag, below the tallis.
The tallis should be on top in order that the tallis is first at hand.




22


If you have no tefillin [and arrive at the synagogue] when the
congregation is already praying, it is preferable to wait until the end of
the service and then borrow tefillin from someone, in order to say the
Shema and the Shemoneh Esrei while wearing tefillin, rather than pray
with the congregation without wearing tefillin. However, if you are
afraid that the time limit for Shema will elapse before you find tefillin,
you should recite the Shema without tefillin. If you are afraid the time
limit for prayer will also elapse, you should also pray without tefillin;
and later when you find tefillin put them on, pronouncing the required
berachos, and then recite a Psalm, or put them on for the Mincha
service. However, the night is not the proper time to wear tefillin, and
it is forbidden to put them on at night. It is permissible to take
someone else's tefillin even without his knowledge [in order] to put
them on and recite the berachos over them, (as was mentioned in the
previous chapter, paragraph 11, in regard to a tallis).

23

He who wears tefillin must have a clean body, and must be careful not
to flatulate while wearing them. A person suffering from diarrhea,
although he has no actual pain, is exempt from the mitzvah of tefillin,
because he is incapable of keeping himself properly clean. If he feels
that he will be able to keep his body clean when reading the Shema and
during the Shemoneh Esrei, he may then put on tefillin. Regarding any
other sick person, if he suffers pain from his sickness, and his mind is
not at ease because of his pain, he is exempt from the mitzvah because
it is forbidden to divert his attention from the tefillin; but if he is not in
pain he must put them on.




24


When a minor knows how to care for tefillin properly, not to flatulate
while wearing them, and not to sleep while wearing them, his father is
obligated to purchase tefillin for him to put on. It is now the prevailing
custom that a child begins putting on tefillin two or three months prior
to his becoming thirteen years old.

25

As regards putting on tefillin on the intermediary days of Yom Tov,
there is a dispute among the authorities and there are various customs.
Some communities hold like those authorities who maintain not to
wear them at all. Other communities hold like those authorities who
maintain that they should be worn but without reciting the berachos
over them aloud in the synagogue, as is done on other days of the year.
In other communities they have a custom to put them on without
reciting the berachos at all. (And a person should bear in mind that if
the intermediary days are not the proper time for tefillin, the tefillin
should be considered as ordinary straps.) Even though you do not recite
the berachos, nevertheless, it is forbidden to interrupt between putting
on the shel yad and the shel rosh. However, you may interrupt for
Kaddish and Kedushah. Care must be taken that among the worshipers
in any one synagogue, there should not be some who put on tefillin and
some who do not put them on. (This seems to be the correct way
because otherwise there would certainly be a problem of Lo Sisgodidu.)

26

Once tefillin are assumed to be kosher, then according to halachah, as
long as the bayis itself is in perfect condition, the scrolls inside are also
presumed to be kosher and do not require examination. Nevertheless, it
is proper to examine them because sometimes they become spoiled
because of perspiration. If you wear them only periodically, they require





examination two times every seven years, because they may have
become moldy. Also, if the bayis tore the scrolls also require
examination. This also applies if they were soaked in water.
Nevertheless, if there was no [competent person] to examine the scrolls
and to resew the tefillin, you may wear them without examination, in
order not to negate the mitzvah but should not recite the berachos over
them.

According to Rambam, a house must have these ten conditions for it to require a
mezuzah: It must be at least six square feet, it must have two door-posts, a lintel, a
ceiling, doors, an opening with a height of at least ten handbreadths, it must be used
for secular purposes only, it must be used as a dwelling for people, it must be for
dignified usage and it must be a permanent dwelling.

It is a positive commandment to affix a mezuzah on every doorway.
Even if you have several rooms and each room has several entrances that
are made for entry and exit, even though you are accustomed to use
only one of these doorways, nevertheless, all of the doorways must have
a mezuzah. [Also] even if the number of dwellers has diminished and
you (the present dweller) now require only one doorway, nevertheless,
all the doorways must have a mezuzah. However, if there is a particular
doorway which is designated only as a place of entry for periodic
deliveries and there is also an additional doorway which is used for both
entry and exit, then the doorway which is used solely for delivery is
exempt.




2


Gates opening into courtyards and alleyways and cities and provinces,
are required to have mezuzos, as it is said: ""In your gateways.""

3

The mezuzah should be placed on the right side as you enter. If you
affix the mezuzah on the left side the mitzvah is invalid; and you are
required to remove the mezuzah and reaffix it on the right side and
[again] recite the berachah. There is no distinction in this rule whether
one is left-handed or not.

4

If there are two houses and each house has its own doorway which
opens to either a public domain or to a courtyard and in the partition
between the houses there is also a door, we must now deliberate how to
regard this door, regarding the proper side to affix the mezuzah. We are
guided by the location of the hinges, that is: the side where the hinges
are attached and toward which the door opens. This is considered the
main part of the house, and we place the mezuzah on the right side (of
the doorway) which serves as the point of entry. This rule applies only
when the two houses are used equally, but if one of the houses is the
main place of utility, we are not guided by the position of the hinges;
but should always place the mezuzah on the right side of the entrance
to the house which is the main place of utility. This applies even if the
door opens into the second house.

5

The mezuzah must be affixed at the beginning of the upper third of the
height of the door-post. If you affix it higher than this, it is also valid
providing it is distanced at least one tefach [handbreadth] away from
the lintel. If you affixed the mezuzah below the upper third of the
doorpost, you must remove the mezuzah and reaffix it in the proper





manner and recite the berachah. If you placed the mezuzah within the
uppermost tefach, you should also remove it and reaffix it properly, but
without reciting the berachah. It is best to affix the mezuzah within the
tefach closest to the outside of the door-post, but if you deviate from
this rule the basic fulfillment of the mitzvah is unaffected.
6

How do you affix the mezuzah? You roll the parchment from the end to
the beginning, that is, from the word echad toward shema, and then
place the scroll in a tubular case or any other container, and affix the
mezuzah diagonally to the doorpost with nails. The angle of the
diagonal should be such that the top of the mezuzah scroll which
begins with the word shema, is toward the inside of the house, and the
last line of the scroll is toward the outside. If the doorpost is not
sufficiently wide, you should affix the mezuzah in a verticle position.
This is preferable to affixing it behind the door. If you did not affix the
mezuzah but merely hung the mezuzah, the mitzvah is invalid.
Similarly, you must be careful to fasten the mezuzah at its top and also
at its bottom so that it does not hang.

7

Before affixing the mezuzah recite the berachah: ""Who sanctified us
with His command and commanded us to affix a mezuzah."" If you affix
several mezuzos [at one time], one berachah suffices for all of them. If
the mezuzah falls off and you reaffix it, you should again recite the
berachah. However, if you remove the mezuzah in order to examine it,
it is questionable if you are required to recite another berachah.

8

Some gates have a smaller doorway near the large opening of the gate,
and through this small opening people usually go out and come in;
whereas the main gate is used only occasionally. Since these are two





separate doorways having between them a post which has the width of
a tefach, two mezuzos are required.
9

In a place where you suspect that people might steal the mezuzah, if
possible you should make a groove in the doorpost of the house and
place the mezuzah in it; but do not make the groove deeper than a
tefach, because there the mezuzah would not be ""on the doorposts of
your house"" but in the doorpost, and would be invalid. You should also
be careful that in all circumstances the place of the mezuzah should be
distinct. If you cannot possibly cut out part of the doorpost of the
house, in this situation you may affix the mezuzah inside the house
behind the door, but only on the doorpost itself and not on an inner
wall of the house, and the mezuzah should not be distanced more than
a tefach from the doorway opening, because then it would be invalid.

10

A house is not required to have a mezuzah unless it has the dimensions
of four amos by four amos. If there are no dimensions of four amos by
four amos but there is the equivalent area of the square of four amos, for
example if the length was greater than the width or if the area was
round; some maintain that it requires a mezuzah and others maintain
that it does not.

11

A doorway does not require a mezuzah unless it has two doorposts
which have the minimal height of ten tefachim and a lintel above them.
Even if the doorposts were not of wood or stones, but rather the walls
of the structure itself serve as the doorposts and there was a ceiling on
top of them, a mezuzah is also required. If a house had only one
doorpost, for instance where on one side a wall extends as a
perpendicular from a side wall as illustrated in this diagram: If the





extension is from the left side, a mezuzah is not required, but if the
extension is from the right side, there is a question [if a mezuzah is
required]; therefore the mezuzah should be put up without reciting a
berachah, or put up after affixing another mezuzah on a doorway which
definitely requires a mezuzah and the berachah will exempt the
doubtful doorway. Similarly, in any case where the requirement of
mezuzah is doubtful, this practice should be followed.
12

If the doorway has two doorposts without a lintel, but there is above
them an arched top, like a bow or even if there are no doorposts at all
but rather the arch itself extends upward from the ground in a curve, if
the entrance has a height of ten tefachim and a width of four tefachim it
requires a mezuzah. In the case of stores where one doorpost is made to
reach from the ground until the lintel, and another doorpost that does
not reach until the lintel but rather the wall above that post is cut out
approximately an amah or more, as illustrated in the diagram: if the
doorpost which extends to the lintel is to the right of the entrance, the
mezuzah is placed on that doorpost. If the smaller doorpost is on the
right side of entry, if it is ten tefachim high the mezuzah is placed on it,
and if it is not ten tefachim high it is affixed to the wider part of the
wall.

13

There are some Halachic authorities who maintain that even if there are
no doors on the entrance, it still requires a mezuzah, and there are
others who maintain that there must be a door; and therefore you
should not affix a mezuzah until you first hang the door. You should
not first affix the mezuzah and then hang the door because we must
comply with the scripture, ""You shall make"" and not from what is
already made.




14


A house that is not designated for permanent dwelling does not require
a mezuzah, therefore the sukkah ""on Sukkos"" requires no mezuzah.
Similarly, those stores that are constructed on the market day solely for
the duration of the market, and are afterwards dismantled; or if they
remain without being used [these] likewise require no mezuzah.
However, stores that are permanently open for business require a
mezuzah.

15

A porch which has three partitions and a ceiling above them, but is
open on the fourth side, even though it has two columns (on the fourth
side) in the form of a doorway, requires no mezuzah, because the
columns are not made for the purpose of forming doorposts but rather
to support the ceiling. However, if there is also a partition on the fourth
side, even though the partitions are low and do not extend to the
ceiling, and even though they are constructed with many open spaces, a
mezuzah is required.

16

A gate house which is a small hut near the gate of a courtyard, in which
the watchman stays, or a hallway which serves as a passageway to go up
to an attic, or a garden or a corral, are exempt from mezuzah, because
[these enclosures] are not made for dwelling. However, if a house which
requires a mezuzah is open to any of these enclosures or to a porch,
these enclosures then require a mezuzah; even for those doors that
people enter from a public thoroughfare. And therefore gates of
courtyards and gate of alleyways and gates of provinces and cities all
require mezuzos, since houses that require mezuzos open into them.
Even if there are ten houses and one is open to the other, and that one
in turn is open to another (even if the outer nine houses are all exempt





from mezuzah), if the inner house requires a mezuzah, they all require a
mezuzah, and therefore a gate which opens from a garden to a
courtyard is required to have a mezuzah. Others maintain, however,
that a gate house or a hallway must have a mezuzah even if no house
opens into them, and therefore one should affix a mezuzah but without
reciting the berachah.
17

A bathhouse and a tannery and a mikvah (ritualarium) are exempt from
mezuzah because they are not used as dignified dwellings. A stable, or a
room in which birds are raised, or a house in which straw or wood is
stored, or storehouses of wine, or other drinks, that have the
dimensions of a house require a mezuzah but others maintain that they
are exempt.

18

In a place where children are usually found or in a room where people
sometimes bathe, or urinate the mezuzah should be covered. It is only
when these practices are occasional that we may rely on the covering;
however, if something odious is permanently installed, for example,
when a urinal is placed near the mezuzah, we cannot rely merely on
covering the mezuzah.

19

A house or a courtyard in which a gentile also resides, is exempt from
the mitzvah of mezuzah.

20

A cellar whose doorposts and doorway are flush with the ground is
exempt from the mitzvah of mezuzah, because it is not considered a
doorpost unless it is standing.

21

If you rent a house outside of Eretz Yisrael you are exempt from
mezuzah for thirty days. because it is not considered a permanent





dwelling [during this time].
22

If you move away from your house and it is to be occupied by another
Jew you should not remove the mezuzos but should leave them there
and the new occupant should pay for them.

23

One must be very diligent to observe the commandment of mezuzah
because it is the obligation of everyone at all times. Wherever you enter
or leave your home, you will encounter the Oneness of Hashem, the
Name of the Holy One, blessed is He, and recalling His love you will
awaken from your lethargy and cease going astray after the vanities of
the times. You will then realize that nothing endures forever except the
knowledge of the Eternal One, and will immediately return to your
senses, and walk in the path of the righteous. Our Sages of blessed
memory say: ""He who has tefillin on his head and on his arm, and
wears tzitzis on his garment, and has a mezuzah on his doorpost, is sure
not to sin, because he has many reminders and these are the guardian
angels who save him from sin."" And it is said: ""The angel of Hashem
encamps around those who fear Him and sets them free."" Our Sages of
blessed memory also say: ""Because of the sin of mezuzah his sons and
daughters may die young, whereas one who is diligent to observe the
mitzvah of mezuzah will have his days lengthened,"" as it is said: ""In
order that your days be lengthened and the days of your children.""

24

Since the mezuzah serves as a reminder of the Oneness of Hashem's
Name, therefore, when leaving the house and when entering you
should kiss the mezuzah. But you should not place your hand directly
on the mezuzah itself; it is therefore important to have a glass
encasement cover the Name of Hashem. When leaving the house and





placing your hand on the mezuzah, you should say: ""Hashem is my
keeper Hashem is my protector by my right hand. Hashem will
preserve my going out and my coming in from now until eternity.""
25

The mezuzah of an individual should be examined two times every
seven years, and one belonging to a group (in order to avoid excessive
bother) should be examined two times every fifty years.
"
"1

It is written: ""Prepare to meet your God, O Israel."" Preparing yourself
before Hashem, Blessed is He, means that you should dress yourself in
the same type of respectful clothing when you pray, as you would when
meeting a high official. Even if you pray privately in your home you
should dress properly. In those places where the custom is to wear a
special sash [during prayers], it is forbidden to pray until you gird
yourself [with such a sash].

2

It is good to give charity before praying, as it is said: ""As for me, with
righteousness I will behold Your Presence."" You should also resolve
before each prayer to fulfill the mitzvah to ""Love your neighbor as
yourself."" You must determine to love every Jew as yourself, because if
there is, God forbid, dissension within Israel in this world, there is no
harmony in the world above. However, when there is unity in this
world it causes spiritual unity of our souls in the world above, and as a
result, our prayers are unified; and when our prayers are unified, they
are accepted favorably before Him, Blessed is His Name.




3


It is written: ""Guard your feet when you walk to the house of God.""
Our Sages, of blessed memory, explain that ""your feet,"" refers to the
openings that are near the legs. Therefore, before praying you must
check if you need to relieve yourself. If you feel even the slightest urge
for relief, you are forbidden to pray. It is even forbidden to study Torah
when the body is feculent until you relieve yourself. If, however, you
prayed when you had the urge to relieve yourself, if you approximated
that you could have restrained yourself the length of time it takes to
walk a parsah (an hour and a fifth) your prayer is valid. If you could not
have restrained yourself even though you have already prayed, your
prayer is an abomination and you must pray again. Some authorities
hold that if you can restrain yourself for the period of a parsah, you may
even begin praying in this condition. You may rely on this opinion in a
situation where if you relieve yourself the time limit for prayer will
elapse. See chapter 18, paragraph 16.

4

If you are sure that you cannot restrain yourself from flatulating until
after completing the Shema and the Amidah it is preferable to let the
period of Shema and the Amidah elapse rather than pray with an
unclean body. If the prayer period then elapses, you are considered a
victim of circumstance (and you may pray later as is explained further
in Chapter 21). If you feel that you can restrain yourself during the
reading of Shema you should put on the tefillin between the blessing of
habocheir be'amo Yisraeil be'ahavah and the Shema and recite the
berachah upon them.

5

The hands must be washed with water until the wrist, before praying.
Therefore, even though you washed your hands in the morning, if your





hands touched an unclean spot i. e., parts of the body that are normally
covered, where there is an accumulation of sweat, or if you scratched
your head, or if you did not wash them until the wrist [in the
morning], you must wash them again before praying. If there is no
water available you must attempt to acquire some; even traveling four
mil (72 minutes) or backward one mil. If you are afraid that meanwhile
the time limit for prayer will elapse, you may clean your hands on a
rock or earth or with any other substance that cleans and then pray, as
it is written: ""I will wash my hands in purity etc."" ""I will wash,"" with
water if possible, and if not ""with nikayon,"" with any substance that
cleanses.
6

If you washed your hands in the morning correctly, but you do not
know if they became soiled, nevertheless, because your mind was
diverted in the interim, even if you had studied Torah in the interim,
this too constitutes a diversion, and you are obligated to wash them
again in preparation for prayer. However, in this case, you are not
required to search exclusively for water; for if there is no water available
and by searching for water you will be late for tefilah betzibur, you need
not search for water but should clean your hands with anything that
cleanses and pray with the congregation.

7

You should make a serious effort to pray with a congregation, as it is
written; ""As for me, may my prayer to You Hashem be at a favorable
time."" When is the time favorable? When the congregation prays
together. It is [also] written: ""Thus said Hashem; at a favorable time I
have answered you."" The Holy One blessed is He never disdains the
prayer of the multitude even though there are sinners in their midst, as
it is written: ""Behold, Hashem is mighty, (meaning He is the God of





the multitude) yet He does not despise anyone."" It is [also] written:
""He has redeemed my soul in peace from impending battle for the sake
of the many that were with me.""
8

If you are traveling and reach the place where you wish to lodge, and
ahead of you within a distance of four mil there is a place where a
congregation prays, and you are able to reach that place while it is
daylight so you will not have to travel alone at night, you must go four
mil ahead in order to pray with the congregation. You must also go
back one mil in order to pray with the congregation. Needless to say
that you should not depart from a place where a congregation prays if
you will be able to reach your desired destination while there is still
daylight.

9

It is a great mitzvah to pray in a synagogue or in a Beis Midrash because
these are sacred places. Even if it happens that there is no minyan, it is
nevertheless a mitzvah to pray there even when praying alone, because
these are holy places. If you usually study in a Beis Midrash you should
also pray there, with ten people, even though in your city there is also a
synagogue. However, if you are not accustomed to study in a Beis
Midrash, you should pray in a synagogue where there is a multitude of
people, for ""In the multitude of people is the glory of the king."" If there
are two synagogues in your city, you should go to the more distant one,
in order to earn a reward for the added steps. Said Rabbi Yehoshua ben
Levi: ""A person should always awaken early and go to a synagogue in
order to be counted among the first ten people, because even if a
hundred come after him, he receives a reward equal to all of them.""
Our Sages, of blessed memory, have also said: ""Whoever goes morning
and evening to the synagogue or to the Beis Midrash in the proper time,





and remains there the proper amount of time, and conducts himself
there with proper sanctity, will merit long life, as it is written:
'Fortunate is the man who listens to Me, watching daily at My gates,
waiting at the posts of My door.' And it is written following this: 'For
whoever finds Me finds life.'"",
10

You should select a synagogue or a Beis Midrash in which to pray
regularly. You also should designate for yourself a specific place for
prayer. The area within a radius of four amos is [still] considered ""your""
place. It is preferable to designate a place near a wall, [if possible], as
did King Chizkiyahu, as it is written: ""And Chizkiyahu turned his face
to the wall etc."" When praying, you should not stand or sit near an evil
person. When you pray in your house [privately] you should also
designate a place for yourself so that you will not be disturbed by the
members of the family.

11

It is a mitzvah to rush when going to the synagogue, or to the Beis
Midrash, or to perform any other mitzvah as it is said: ""Let us run to
know God."" It is also written: ""In the way of Your commandments I
will run."" Therefore, even on Shabbos it is permissable to run in order
to do a mitzvah. However, in the synagogue or in the Beis Midrash, it is
forbidden to run. Upon arriving at the entrance (of the synagogue), it is
proper to pause slightly in order not to enter suddenly. You should
tremble with awe before the splendor of His glory, Blessed be His
Name, and recite the verse: ""As for me, through Your abundant
kindness etc. which is like a request for permission to enter; and then
you should enter and walk with reverence and fear as one who walks
before a king. In those communities where the Jewish people have their
own streets, it is a mitzvah to put on the tzitzis [talis] and tefillin at





home, and proceed to the synagogue [in that attire.] In a place where
they reside among the gentiles, or if a person must walk through filthy
alleys, it is preferable to put on the tzitzis and tefillin in the corridor of
the synagogue, because it is of great merit to enter the synagogue
enwrapped in tzitzis and crowned with tefillin.
12

If because of some emergency you cannot attend the synagogue or the
Beis Midrash; or any other regular minyan, you should make an effort to
gather ten men to pray in your own home with a minyan. If this too is
impossible you should at least pray at the same hour that the
congregation prays, because that is a time of Divine favor. Similarly, if
you live in a place where there is no minyan, you should pray at the
time that the congregations pray in the city. However, if you must study
Torah or do work which you are prohibited to begin before praying as
it is explained in Chapter 8, you are permitted to begin early and pray
immediately after sunrise.

13

Similarly, if you are weak and find it difficult to wait until the
congregation's prayer is completed before eating it is permissible to
pray earlier, in your home, in order to eat immediately (as stated
previously in Chapter 8 par. 2). However, it is only in your home that
you are permitted to pray earlier in this manner, but if you come to the
synagogue in which a congregation is present, it is forbidden to pray
before the congregation prays. Even if you want to leave the synagogue
to pray before the congregation starts, it is forbidden, unless you see
that the congregation is delayed in prayer, then in order to pray before
the time of prayer elapses, you may pray alone. Similarly, if you are sick
or are in some other unavoidable circumstance, you are permitted to





pray earlier even in the synagogue. [In such a case] it is even better to
go home and pray.
14

Some poskim maintain that if one minyan prayed in the synagogue and
another minyan comes to pray there, the second Chazzan should not
stand in the place where the first stood, because this is considered an
affront to the first minyan, unless the first minyan had already left the
synagogue. If the first minyan took out a Seifer Torah and read from it,
the second minyan should not take out the Seifer Torah again to read
from it in that synagogue. However, in many communities they are not
mindful of these protocols, and these matters are governed by local
custom.

15

The inhabitants of a city can force each other to build a synagogue or
Beis Midrash and to buy books in which to study. In a place where there
is no regular minyan the people can force each other by imposing fines
to assemble regularly for a minyan, so that there be no interruption of
the daily service. Even those who are preoccupied with Torah study, and
will thus be prevented from studying Torah can be forced to attend the
minyan, because there is a time for study and a separate time for prayer.
"
"1

The sanctity of a synagogue and Beis Midrash is very great, and we are
commanded to fear the One Who dwells in them, blessed be His
Name; as it is written, ""Revere My Sanctuary."" A Synagogue and Beis
Midrash are also called ""Sanctuaries,"" as it is written: ""I will be to them
as a miniature Sanctuary"" and it is explained that this refers to the
Synagogue and the Batei Midrash. Therefore, it is forbidden to engage





there in idle talk, or to make calculations, except those that pertain to a
mitzvah, such as the calculations of charity funds, or the like. Such
places must be treated with respect, they must be kept meticulously
clean, and candles must be lit in them to show our respect. You should
not kiss your small children there, because it is not proper to
demonstrate any other love except the love of Hashem, blessed be His
Name.
2

Before entering you should wipe the mud off your shoes, and you
should be careful that there is no dirt on your person or on your
clothing. It is permissible to expectorate [if you must], but it must be
rubbed out with your feet immediately.

3

You should not enter in the summer in order to find shelter from the
heat, nor to find refuge from the rain. You may enter to call a friend,
but you must first recite a few verses of Scripture, or study a mishnah,
or say a prayer, or listen to a Torah discourse, or, at least, sit down for a
short while, for even sitting in a holy place is a mitzvah, and then you
may call your friend.

4

It is forbidden to eat or drink or sleep in a holy place, even if it is only a
short nap. However, for the sake of a mitzvah, for example, if you wish
to spend Yom Kippur night [in the synagogue,] it is permissible to sleep
there, but you should keep a distance from the Aron HaKodesh.
Similarly, eating there for the sake of a mitzvah, provided there is no
drunkenness or levity connected with it, is permitted. Likewise, those
who study regularly in the synagogue are permitted to eat there and to
sleep normally, in order not to lose time from their studies.




5


When building a synagogue it is necessary to consult a Torah scholar to
determine how it should be constructed.
"
"1

Pesukei D'zimrah consists of psalms and prayers beginning with Hodu
until after the Shirah (Oz Yashir). Baruch She'amar is the preceding
berachah and Yishtabach is the concluding berachah. It is prohibited to
speak, even in Hebrew, between Baruch She'amar until after Shemoneh
Esrei. (Similarly, wherever interruption is prohibited it is prohibited
even in Hebrew.) There is a difference between pesukei d'zimrah and its
berachos, and Kerias Shema and its berachos regarding an interruption
for the purpose of a mitzvah. During pesukei d'zimrah even in midBaruch She'amar or in mid- Yishtabach, if you hear any berachah you
may answer: Amein. Similarly, if you hear the congregation saying
Kerias Shema, you may recite Shema Yisroel with them. Certainly for
Kaddish, for Kedushah, and for Barechu you may interrupt and respond
with the congregation. However, if you can arrange to interrupt for
these prayers at a pause, such as between psalms, or at least between
verses, you should do so. Baruch hu u'varuch shemo should not be said
in mid pesukei d'zimrah even at a pause (since baruch hu u'varuch shemo
is not mentioned in the Talmud.) Also, the words: Yisbarach
veyishtabach etc. that are said when the chazzan sings Barechu should
not be said [during pesukei d'zimrah], since it is only a custom.
Similarly, if you went to the lavoratory and washed your hands, it seems
to me that you should not recite the berachah, Asher Yatzar, since you
can recite it afterwards.




2


You should hold the two front tzitzis and say Baruch She'amar while
standing, and upon completing mehulall batishbachos, kiss them and
release them. The entire pesukei d'zimrah should be said calmly, in a
pleasant and unhurried [manner]. Be careful of every word as if you
were counting money. Pay attention to the meaning of the words,
especially [while saying] the verse, poseach es yadecha etc. [You open
Your hand]. This verse should be said with great concentration and
prayer for your own sustenance as well as the sustenance of all Israel. If
you did not concentrate at all, even after having completed [the verse]
you must read it again attentively. Between [the word:] Elilim [idols]
and [the words:] v'Adon-y sho'maim osoh, you should pause
momentarily, so that it not seem as if referring to the above.

3

You must be careful not to touch places of the body which are normally
covered, or the covered area of the head when saying pesukei d'zimrah
and certainly until after all the prayers. The mucus in the nose as well as
within the ear is also not to be touched unless by means of a cloth. If
you did touch [the above] with your hand, wash your hand with water.
If you are in mid-Shemoneh Esrei when you cannot go for water, it is
sufficient to cleanse with a stone, or by rubbing your hand against the
wall, or by any similar means.

4

[The Psalm] Mizmor Lesodah should be said while standing and with
joy for [this psalm] represents the Thanksgiving sacrifice. Similarly,
from Vayevarach David until atah hu Hashem Ha'elokim, should be said
while standing. The Shirah, too, should be said while standing, with
concentration and with joy. During the berachah—Yishtabach, you
should also stand.




5


At the time of the Beis HaMikdosh a Thanksgiving sacrifice, Korbon Todah, was
brought by:
1) A person released from prison, 2) A seriously ill person who recuperated, 3) A
person returning from a sea voyage, 4) A person travelling through the wilderness and
arriving at his destination. As with other sacrifices, after the destruction of the
Temple, we now substitute prayer and discussion of the korbonos. It is for this reason
that in our prayers we mirror some aspects of the actual korbonos. Thus, on a day that
a particular korbon is not brought, we do not say the prayer that represents that
korbon.
Only communal sacrifices which have a set period within which they must be brought
are permitted on Shabbos and Yom Tov. Individual korbonos, such as the Todah, or
communal sacrifices that have no allotted time may not be brought on Shabbos and
Yom Tov. A Todah (or any other korbon, for that matter) is not brought when the full
time allotted for the eating of the korbon is not available (in this case—one day and
the following night).

On Shabbos and Yom Tov Mizmor Lesodah is omitted because the
Todah sacrifice is voluntary, and voluntary sacrifices may not be
brought on Shabbos and Yom Tov. It is also omitted in the intermediary
days of Pesach because a Todah sacrifice is not brought then, since,
along with the Todah, ten leavened breads are also required. Pesach eve,
too, [the Todah is not brought] since, [the breads] may possibly not be
eaten by the time the chametz prohibition begins and they will have to
be burnt. Yom Kippur eve, [too, the Todah is not brought] because the
time for eating is diminished, causing sacrifices to become invalid.
6

If you did not arrive at the synagogue, until after the congregation had
begun to pray, and by praying in the proper order you will not manage
to recite the Shemoneh Esrei along with them, and, whereas, the main





objective is that one pray the Shemoneh Esrei together with the
congregation, you may, therefore omit [part of pesukei d'zimrah] as will
[soon] be explained. However, [in any circumstance,] the berachah—al
netilas yadayim, the berachos on the Torah, and the berachah—Elokai
Neshamah, must always be said before praying. Therefore, if you did
not say them at home, you must say them at the synagogue, even if, as a
result, you will lag behind [and be unable] to pray with the
congregation. Also Kerias Shema with its berachos, which are said during
shacharis prayers, must be said before Shemoneh Esrei; that is, you must
begin with the berachah—Yotzeir Or and [continue] praying in the
proper order until after Shemoneh Esrei without any interruption. (The
berachah of Ga'al Yisroel must be adjoined with the Shemoneh Esrei
without interruption.) However, the rest of the berachos, the rest of the
order and pesukei d'zimrah (omitting ""Baruch She'amar"" and
""Yishtabach"") can be said also after Shemoneh Esrei.
7

Therefore, if after having said the three above-mentioned berachos and
having put on tallis and tefillin, you realize that you do not have
sufficient time to reach and pray Shemoneh Esrei together with the
congregation, unless you skip and begin with the berachah: Yotzer Or,
then you should begin there. If you have enough time to say: Baruch
She'amar and: Tehillah leDavid until the end, that is; [until:] sheim
kodsho l'olam va'ed and Yishtabach, then you should say them. If you
have more time, then you should also say: Halleluyah, hallelu keil
bekodsho until: kol haneshama tehalleil y-oh, halleluyah. If you have even
more time, then you should also say: Halleluyah, hallelu es Hashem min
hashamayim etc. If you have yet more time, you should say the rest of
the Halleluyah's. If you have even more time, then you should also say:
Vayevarech David until: lesheim tifartecha. And if you have yet more





time, then you should also say: Hodu until: vehu rachum, then skip
until the vehu rachum which precedes Ashrei and begin there. Regarding
the psalms that are added on Shabbos and Yom Tov, if you do not have
sufficient time to say them, then all the psalms and verses that are said
every day, have preference. If you have sufficient time to say some of
those that are added, then it seems to me, that on Shabbos and Yom
Kippur, Mizmor Shir leyom HaShabbos and the Great Hallel (which is
Hodu lashem ki tov etc. have preference, whereas, on the other Yamim
Tovim, only the Great Hallel has preference; followed by the psalm:
Lamnatzeach, leDavid beshanoso, [then] Tefilla leMoshe. All of these
psalms and verses should be said before Yishtabach. After completing
the prayers you should make up all that you skipped; except: Baruch
She'amar and Yishtabach which are not said after prayers. If you realize
that even if you begin with the berachah: Yotzeir Or, you will still not
manage to pray the Shemoneh Esrei together with the congregation
unless you rush, then, it is better to pray individually in the proper
order, slowly and with concentration. (see above 20: 11, 12)
8

If you arrive at the synagogue and the congregation is beginning to
recite the pesukei d'zimrah, and you have no tallis and tefillin, but you
expect that they will be brought to you you may also pray pesukei
d'zimrah, and when the tallis and tefillin are brought, you should put
them on after Yishtabach, before the berachah: Yotzeir Or, and then
recite the berachah over them. If you are concerned that as a result of
putting them on you will be prevented from praying Shemoneh Esrei
together with the congregation, then you may skip from vehu rachum of
Hodu until vehu rachum preceding Ashrei, or from Vayosha until
Yishtabach and say only the major psalms as was written above (para.
7), so that you may have sufficient time to put them on after you have





said Yishtabach, before the chazzan says Kaddish. (See above Chapter
10: 23).
"
"1

After [completing] Yishtabach the chazzan says half-Kaddish. Kaddish,
Barechu and Kedushah cannot be said and the Torah cannot be read
unless there are ten adult men present. If ten men were not present
when Yishtabach was said but, the minyan was completed afterwards,
then, the chazzan may not say Kaddish, because Kaddish is said only
following something that was said by ten men. They should, therefore,
wait to say Yishtabach until ten [men] arrive. They may wait until
almost a half-hour. They should not wait longer, but, rather, they
should say Yishtabach and then wait. When ten [men] arrive they
should first say a few verses, and afterwards the chazzan says halfKaddish.

2

An adult, is one whose thirteenth year has passed and he has entered his
fourteenth year (we may rely on the assumption that he has probably
grown two pubic hairs.) For example: If he was born on Rosh Chodesh
Nissan, he does not attain adulthood until Rosh Chodesh Nissan; that is,
at the beginning of the night of Rosh Chodesh Nissan; thirteen years
after birth, he becomes an adult. If he is born in the month of Adar
during a regular year and when reaching adulthood it is a leap year, he
does not attain adulthood until the second Adar. But, if he is born on
the first Adar of a leap year, he also attains adulthood during the first
Adar. If he is born during a leap year and he reaches adulthood during a
regular year, regardless of whether he was born during the first Adar or





during the second Adar—he attains adulthood on his birthday during
the Adar of the present [year]. Thus, at times, the result is that a boy
born before his friend, may attain adulthood later than his friend who
was born after him. For example: they were both born during a leap
year; one on the twentieth of Adar I, and the second on the tenth of
Adar II, and the year they attain adulthood is a regular year.
3

Care should be taken not to take a head-count of people to verify
whether there is a minyan, because it is forbidden to take a head-count
of Jews even for the purpose of a mitzvah, for it is written: ""And Saul
gathered the nation and counted them by means of lambs."" It is
customary to count them by reciting the verse: Hoshiah es amecha etc
which contains ten words.

4

It is necessary that all ten [men] be in one place and the chazzan with
them. If some are in one room and some in another room, they are not
considered combined, though the door between them is open. Even if
the majority are in the synagogue and the minority are in the vestibule
in front of the synagogue, they are not drawn to the majority to be
combined with them. Even those standing on the threshhold, within
the opening on its outer flank, that is—when the door is closed — that
place is on the outside, though the door may now be open,
nevertheless, it is considered outside. All this applies to combining ten
[for a minyan], but, if there were ten and they are saying Kaddish,
Barechu or Kedushah, then, whoever hears them may respond with
them, even if many houses separate them [from the main minyan],
because even an ""iron curtain"" cannot separate Israel from their Father
in Heaven, provided that there was no excrement or idolatry present
there.




5


You should take great care to listen to the Kaddish and respond with
concentration. Certainly at Amein, yehei shemei rabba … you should
concentrate well, for, who ever responds, Amein, yehei shemei rabba …
with all his strength and concentration his decree of seventy years is
nullified. The response should be loud, because with this sound you can
shatter all the indictments and nullify all evil decrees. Nevertheless, you
should not overshout so that people will not ridicule you thereby,
causing them to sin. Amein,yehei shemei rabba etc. is said along with the
word: yisbarach. Afterwards you should listen to the chazzan and
respond: Amein.

6

Some authorities maintain that you are not required to stand during
Kaddish. But, if you are already standing when Kaddish is to be said for
instance, after Halleil, you should remain standing until after: Amein,
yehei shemei rabba. Others hold the opinion that you should always
stand during Kaddish as well as during other prayers of Kedushah. This
can be derived by means of a kal v'chomer from the case of Eglon, king
of Moab, for it is written: ""Ehud came to him etc. and Ehud said: 'I
have brought you a word of God. ' And he (Eglon) stood up from his
throne."" If Eglon King of Moab, who was an idol worshipper, rose [to
hear] the word of God, how much more so, [should] we, who are His
people. Therefore, it is preferable to be stringent.

7

If there are not nine [men] listening to the chazzan he should not say
Kaddish at all because a sacred prayer should not be said with less than
ten; that is one reciting and nine listening. Nevertheless, if one of the
ten is in the middle of his Shemoneh Esrei although he cannot respond
with them he may be counted [in the ten]. The same applies to two,





three or four, [who are in mid Shemoneh Esrei] as long as there is a
majority responding, then the response of the minority is not a
necessity. However, if one of them is asleep, he should be wakened
because one who is sleeping cannot be counted in the ten.
8

After the chazzan says half-Kaddish, he says aloud: Barechu es Hashem
hamevorach,

and

the

congregation

responds:

Baruch

Hashem

hamevorach le'olam va'ed, and the chazzan, as well, repeats: Baruch
Hashem hamevorach le'olam va'ed, so that he does not exclude himself
from the congregation, by telling them to bless [God] and he himself
does not do so. There are some whose custom it is to respond Amein to
the chazzan. But the chazzan should not respond after the
congregation's blessing. If the chazzan prolongs the melody while
saying Barechu, the congregation says Yisbarach etc. [However,] it
should be said only while he (the chazzan) sings, but while he says the
words, they should say nothing, but rather listen to what he is saying.
Even if you did not hear the chazzan saying Barechu but only heard the
congregation respond Baruch etc., you may respond along with them.
9

The Kedushah of Yotzeir should preferably be said with the
congregation. But, if this is not possible you may also say it
individually.

10

If there is only an exact minyan, in the synagogue it is prohibited for
any of them to leave. Of one who leaves it is said: ""Those who abandon
God will be consumed."" But, if ten will remain, the rest may leave if
they have already heard Barechu, Kedushah and the Kaddishim after
Aleinu. In the event that less than ten were left they may conclude the
prayers, even with less than ten (provided that they are a majority of a





minyan). If the chazzan had started to repeat the Shemoneh Esrei, he
may complete the entire repetition of the Shemoneh Esrei and the
congregation may say Kedushah, and he (the chazzan) also says:
Elokeinu veilokei avoseinu barecheinu baberachah etc. However, the
kohanim do not bless the congregation. Also, the Kaddish that follows
the Shemoneh Esrei is not said because these are different subjects. If
they began the Torah reading with ten men and some [congregants]
leave, the reading may be completed, but no additional [aliyahs] are
permitted, and no one is called for maftir, but, rather, the last of the
allotted olim reads the Haftarah without the berachos.
11

The chazzan must be a worthy person for it is said: [God says of His
nation]: ""She raises her voice at Me, I therefore, have contempt for
her,"" and our Rabbis of blessed memory, said, that this refers to an
unworthy chazzan who, [nevertheless,] goes down to the Amud. Who is
considered worthy? One who is free of sin and who is respectful, that is,
his reputation is untarnished, and was unblemished even during his
youth; and one who is humble and acceptable to the congregation so
that they agree that he lead the prayers. He should have a pleasant and a
sweet voice, which draws [appeals to] the heart, and he should be one
who regularly reads the Scriptures, so that the verses in prayer are fluent
in his mouth. If a person cannot be found with all these attributes,
[then] they (the congregation) should choose one among them who
excels in wisdom and good deeds.

12

No person may pray [at the Amud] against the will of the congregation.
If one does pray without permission, through intimidation and
arrogance, [the congregation] should not respond: Amein after his





berachos, as it is said: ""And the brazen utters a blessing, he has mocked
Hashem.""
13

No one should be appointed a permanent chazzan whose beard is not
fully grown. But, on occasion, any male who has passed his thirteenth
year may ""go down"" to the Amud.
"
"1

Kerias Shema and its three berachos which are: Yotzer or, Ahava rabba,
[and] Emes veyatziv (likewise at the ma'ariv service—Kerias Shema and
its berachos) are more stringent [in regard to interruptions] than pesukei
d'zimrah. They (i. e. Kerias Shema and its berachos ) are divided into
""sections."" The following are considered ""between sections."" between
Yotzer hameoros and Ahava rabba between habocher beamo Yisrael
beahava and Shema Yisrael, between uvish'arecha and ve'haya im
shamo'a, [and] between al ha'aretz and vayomer.

2

""Between sections"" you are permitted to answer Amein to any berachah
that you hear. And, of course, you are permitted to respond to
Kedushah, to Kaddish and to Barechu. But, Baruch hu uvaruch shemo
may not be said. Also, if you hear the congregation reciting Kerias
Shema, you should not say the [entire] verse of Shema Yisrael with
them, but, rather say, whatever you are reciting, aloud, in the same
manner that the congregation is saying Shema Yisrael, so that it appears
as if you are reading along with them.

3

In ""mid-section"" you should not respond Amein except following the
berachah—ha'el hakadosh, and following the berachah Shomea Tefillah.





[Upon hearing] Kaddish you may respond: Yehei shemei rabba mevorach
le'olam ule'olmei almaya; and when the chazzan says: da'amiran be'alma
ve'imru amein, you may also respond: Amein. However, to the rest of
the Amein's of the Kaddish, you may not respond, because they are not
of the essence of the Kaddish. [Upon hearing] Kedushah, you should
remain silent and listen to the chazzan, and [then] say with the
congregation: Kadosh, kadosh, kadosh Hashem Zeva'os melo chol haaretz
kevodo and then remain silent; [then] say along with the congregation:
Boruch k'vod Hashem mimekomo. You may not say the rest for it is not
of the essence of Kedushah. Upon hearing Barechu from the chazzan, or
from one who was called to [the reading] of the Torah, you may
respond: Baruch Hashem hamevorach le'olam va'ed, as well as Amein
which follows the berachos of the oleh. If the congregation is saying
Modim, you should also bow [with them] and say: Modim anachnu
lach, but no more. Upon hearing the sound of thunder, some hold, that
you are permitted to interrupt and recite the berachah. Others maintain
that you may not interrupt for this.
4

If these interruptions which are permitted in mid-section, if they occur
in the berachos [of Shema], you should manage to make the
interruption at the completion of a subject; and if it is during Kerias
Shema, you should manage to make the interruption between verses. If
this is not possible, [then] you may interrupt even in mid-sentence, and
then start again from the beginning of the verse.

5

The rule we stated [above] —that it is permitted to interrupt in midsection for those things which we enumerated above does not apply to
the verse: Shema Yisrael etc. and: Baruch sheim kevod malchuso le'olam
va'ed, because when reciting these two verses it is prohibited to





interrupt in any circumstance. Even if the king greets you, you may not
interrupt to respond. Between Ani Hashem Elokeichem and Emes
veyatziv you should also not interrupt because Scripture states: ""And
Adono-y Elohi-m is true."" Therefore, [to fulfill this verse], it is not
permitted to interrupt between elokeichem and emes. It is preferable to
take care not to interrupt until after you have also said the word
veyatziv (because it also means ""truth."") Afterwards after having said
emes veyatziv you may interrupt just as any other place in mid-section.
(The practice of greeting or responding to a greeting nowadays is not
insisted upon and you should not interrupt for this purpose even [when
you are] between sections.)
"
"1

The earliest time for reading the morning Shema is the same as that for
putting on tefillin, (See Chapter 10 section 2) and the time period
extends until the end of the first quarter of the day, regardless if the day
is long or short. The length of the day is reckoned from daybreak until
the stars are visible. The commandment is fulfilled in its excellence
when it is read in the manner of the Vasikin (these were pious men who
treasured the mitzvos) who were careful to read it shortly before sunrise,
in order to complete the Shema and its berachos at sunrise, and proceed
with the Amidah immediately thereafter. He who is able to accomplish
this, will merit great reward. In any case, you must be very careful not
to delay [reading Shema] past the first quarter of the day, especially
during the summer when the days are long. In our country, the latest
time [for reading the Shema] is before seven o'clock [in the morning.]
Nevertheless, as a last resort, if the time limit has passed, you are





permitted to read the Shema with its berachos until one third of the day.
However, after one third of the day it is forbidden to recite the berachos
but the Shema itself may be read at any hour of the day. (Some
authorities hold that the berachos may also be recited the entire day.)
2

The Shema may be read either sitting or standing. However, if you are
sitting, you are forbidden to follow the stricter view which requires one
to stand. However, you may not read the Shema while reclining, but if
you were already reclining, you should turn completely on your side
and then read it. If you are ill and it is difficult to lie completely on
your side, you must nevertheless incline somewhat to one side.

3

Before beginning you should have the intention of fulfilling the
commandment to read the Shema, as the Holy One, Blessed is He,
commanded us. When saying Shema Yisrael you should concentrate on
its meaning [which is:] Hear Israel, Adonoy Who is our God, He is the
one God, singular and unique in the heavens and on earth. You should
prolong the sound of the ches in the word echad, [to give you enough
time in which] to acknowledge the kingship of the Holy One, Blessed
is He, over heaven and earth. The sound of the daled should also be
prolonged, giving yourself enough time to reflect that the Holy One,
Blessed is He, is singular in His world, and rules over the four corners
of the universe; but you must not prolong the sounds longer than this.
You should be careful not to distort the pronunciation of the word
echad by over emphasizing the letters, for some people [actually] distort
the word; some say: echa-ad, and others say echadeh. It is better not to
prolong the sounds at all, than to prolong them and distort the word. It
is customary to say the verse of Shema Yisrael aloud, in order to
stimulate your concentration; and to put your right hand over your





eyes. After saying echad, pause momentarily and say: Baruch sheim
kevod malchuso leolam va'ed, in an undertone (except on Yom Kippur)
[because then it is said aloud.] Here too, you must concentrate on the
meaning of the words.
4

You should pause for a moment and then say: Ve'ahavta (and you shall
love). Similarly, between this paragraph and the paragraph of Vehayah
im shamo'a, (and it will be if you listen etc.), you should pause
momentarily. Similarly, before saying: Vayomer (and He said) you
should also pause. You should have the intention, when reciting the
paragraph of Vayomer, to fulfil the positive commandment to remember
the exodus from Egypt.

5

The Shema must be read with great exactness from a very carefully
edited prayer book. You should make audible to your ears the words
uttered by your mouth. Take care not to pronounce an accentuated
letter in place of an unaccentuated letter, or an unaccentuated letter in
place of an accentuated letter. A short pause should be made whenever
this symbol appears, (I). Also when reciting Pesukei D'zimrah, it is
necessary to follow these rules. The ayin should be clearly enunciated in
the word, nishba (swore) so that it does not sound as if you said
nishbah, ending with hei. Likewise; the zayin in the word tizkeru and
the zayin in the word uzechartem, must be pronounced correctly, so
that it does not sound as if it were pronounced like a sin.

6

When reading the Shema you may not signal with your eyes, nor move
your lips, nor indicate with your fingers; but for the purpose of
[fulfilling] a commandment, it is permitted to signal when reading the
second paragraph.




7


Before reading the Shema, when saying; Vahavi'enu, (and bring us) etc.
take the tzitzis of the tallis in your hand and hold them while reading
the Shema. They should be held with the left hand, grasped between
the ring finger and little finger and held near the heart. When Vayomer,
the section concerning tzitzis is read, the tzitzis should also be held in
the right hand. When saying Ure'isem oso, (and you will look upon it)
touch them to your eyes, look upon them and kiss them. It is
customary to kiss them each time the word tzitzis is said. They should
be held until the words, Venechemadim la'ad are said; after which they
should be kissed and released.

8

After saying Ani Hashem Elokeichem, you should immediately add the
word, emes, without interruption. The Chazzan must also say it this
way [privately] and when he repeats it, he should say: Hashem
Elokeichem emes (Hashem, your God is true.) Everyone must listen
attentively to these three words recited by the Chazzan, because these
three words complete the two hundred forty-eight words of the Shema,
corresponding to the two hundred forty-eight limbs in a man's body.
After Shema, we begin saying Veyatziv (and firm) but it is forbidden to
repeat the word emes. When praying privately [without a minyan],
before reading the Shema, you should say: Eil Melech ne'eman,
(Almighty, faithful king) so that these three words will complete the
number of two hundred forty-eight.

9

If you interrupted while reading the Shema, (i. e. from Shema Yisrael till
al ha'aretz,) [which is the end of the second paragraph] or if through no
fault of yours you were forced to interrupt, for example if you had to go
out to relieve yourself, or if excrement were found in the house, and the





interruption was of such duration that you would be able to read the
entire Shema, you must repeat the Shema from the beginning.
10

If you had already read the Shema and entered the synagogue and
found the congregation reading the Shema, you must read the entire
Shema with them, so that it does not appear as though you are
unwilling to accept the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven with the
congregation. Your reward [for reading the Shema again], will be that of
one who reads the Torah. The same rule applies if you are in a
synagogue reciting supplications or verses [of Torah] where
interruptions are permitted, (the procedure to follow if you are at a
place where interruptions are prohibited, has been previously explained
[See Chapter 16: 2.]) and you have not yet read the Shema, you should
read it with the congregation but with the intention not to fulfill your
obligation [at this time], so that you can read it later with its berachos.
This rule also applies to other prayers that the congregation is reciting
such as the psalm Tehillah leDavid [Ashrei], and Alenu and the like.
Even Piyutim should be said with them, for you must never separate
yourself from the congregation.
"
"1

The ideal time for praying the morning Amidah is at sunrise, as it is
written: ""So they will fear You when the sun shines."" Nevertheless, if
you prayed after day-break, your obligation is fulfilled. The time for
prayer continues until the [first] third of the day, and must not be
delayed longer. Nevertheless, if it so happened that you delayed longer,
even intentionally, you may pray till noon. Even though the reward is
not the same as when you pray at the proper time, you will still be





rewarded for praying. If you willfully delayed until noon without
praying, you can no longer make up for it, and concerning such a
person it is said: ""What is crooked cannot be made straight."" Cases
where the delay was unintentional or because of circumstances beyond
control, will be discussed in Chapter 21.
2

Before saying, Tehillos le'eil elyon, you should stand and prepare yourself
for the prayer of Shemoneh Esrei [Amidah]. You should rid yourself of
phlegm and saliva, and anything that may distract your thoughts; then
walk back three steps and say: tehillos le'eil elyon, and continue till
[Ga'al Yisrael], then return [to your position] by walking three steps
forward in the manner of one approaching a king. You should not
make any interruption between Ga'al Yisrael and Shemoneh Esrei, not
even [in response] to Kaddish, Kedusha, or Barechu, because [the prayer
of ] redemption must be joined to the [Amidah] prayer. It is best to be
precise in concluding the berachah of Ga'al Yisrael simultaneously with
the chazzan, because should you finish first and the chazzan afterwards,
there is a question whether to answer Amein to the berachah of the
chazzan; but when you conclude the berachah with him, you are
certainly not required to answer Amein, because you do not answer
Amein to your own berachah. (See Chapter Six, paragraph eleven.) In
the ma'ariv service, since the berachah preceding the Shemoneh Esrei
[does not] end with Ga'al Yisrael, an interruption is permitted, as it is
permitted at any place between one chapter and another. [See Chapter
16 paragraph 2] Before praying Shemoneh Esrei, we say the verse:
""Hashem, sefasai tiftach"" [My Master open my lips]. This is not
[considered] an interruption because it is relevant to the prayer; but the
verse: ""Ki Sheim Hashem ekra,"" etc. should not be said [before the





Amidah], except at musaf and minchah prayers, before saying, Hashem,
sefasai tiftach.
3

When praying, you should be mindful that the Divine Presence is
before you as it is said in Scriptures: ""Pour out your heart like water
before the Presence of Hashem."" Arouse your concentration, and rid
yourself of all disturbing thoughts, so that your thoughts and
concentration are purely on the prayers. Consider, if you were speaking
before a mortal king, how well you would organize your words and
concentrate on them properly, taking care not to blunder. Certainly
then, before the King, Who is King of kings, the Holy One, blessed is
He, you must concentrate your thoughts before Him; because to Him,
blessed is His Name, thought is the same as speech, and He scrutinizes
all thoughts. Before praying, consider the exalted [majesty] of the
Almighty, blessed is His Name, and the insignificance of man, and
banish [the thoughts] of all humanistic pleasures from your heart.

4

When praying you must concentrate on the meaning of the words that
you utter with your lips, as it is said: ""Guide their heart, let your ear be
attentive."" Many prayer books have been published with translations,
enabling everyone to study and understand the meaning of the prayers.
If you are unable to concentrate on the meaning of the words, at the
very minimum, while praying, you should think about matters that
humble the heart and direct your thoughts towards your Father in
heaven. Should a profane thought enter your mind in the midst of the
[Amidah] prayer, you should be silent [cease praying] and wait until the
thought vanishes.




5


Your feet should be placed next to each other as if they were only one,
to resemble the angels, of whom it is said: ''And their feet were straight
feet."" Which means their feet [ragleihem] appeared as one foot [regel].
Your head should be bent slightly, and your eyes closed, so as not to
gaze at anything. If you are praying from a Siddur do not remove your
eyes from the Siddur. Your hands should be upon your heart, the right
hand upon the left. You should pray wholeheartedly with fear, reverence
and humility, as a poor man standing at the door; and pronounce the
words with concentration and exactness. Everyone should pray
according to his [accustomed] form [of prayer], whether it be
Ashkenazic or Sefardic, or another, [for] they are all based on sacred
origin. However do not intermingle words from one form with another,
because the words of each form are numbered and counted, based on
important mystical concepts, and nothing should be added or
subtracted from them.

6

Take care to pray quietly so that only you yourself may hear what you
are saying, but someone standing next to you should not hear your
voice, as Scripture says of Hannah: ""Only her lips moved [but] her
voice could not be heard.""

7

You should not lean on anything [for] even the slightest support [is
forbidden]. If you are slightly ill you may pray even while sitting or
lying down, provided that you are able to concentrate. If you are unable
to utter the words you should meditate in your heart.

8

Nothing should be held in the hand while praying the Shemoneh Esrei
except the Siddur or Machzor, if needed. Before praying, you should





mark the places to be read in the Siddur or Machzor, avoiding the need
to search for them in the midst of your prayer. There should be no
barrier between you and the wall, as it is said: ""And Hezekiah turned
his face toward the wall and he prayed."" Something is considered a
barrier only if it is ten tefachim high and four tefachim wide, but a
small[er] article is not considered a separation. Even a large article,
when installed permanently, such as a chest or cabinet, is not
considered a separation; neither is a person considered a barrier. When
there is no other choice, you need not be concerned, since you close
your eyes [anyway] or pray from a Siddur, so that your concentration is
not disturbed. You should also not pray in front of a picture, but
should it happen that you are praying in front of a garment or
decorated wall, you should [certainly] close your eyes. It is forbidden to
pray in front of a mirror, even with your eyes closed. You should not
pray in an open space, such as a field, for praying in an enclosed area
causes one to be imbued with awe of the King, and the heart to be
contrite and humbled. When traveling on the road, it is permissible to
pray in the field; if possible however, you should pray among the trees.
9

You must not belch or yawn [when praying the Shemoneh Esrei] but if
you cannot help yourself, place you hand over your mouth, so that your
open mouth is not visible. It is also forbidden to spit, but if there is
saliva in your mouth and it is so annoying that you are distracted from
your prayers, you may cause it to be absorbed in a napkin or
handkerchief. If you find this distasteful, turn to the left and spit
behind you. If you are unable to spit behind you, spit towards your left,
if you cannot spit to your left, you may spit towards your right. If an
insect is stinging you, you should remove it by moving your clothing,
so that your concentration is not diverted, but do not remove it with





your bare hand. If your tallis slips off your shoulders, you may retrieve
it even though most of it has fallen off, but if it falls off completely, you
may not enwrap yourself in it, because that is considered an
interruption. If a [sacred] book falls in front of you and it is on the
ground, and this distracts your concentration, you may pick it up
between berachos. All things that are forbidden during the prayer of
Shemoneh Esrei are prohibited until you have stepped three paces
backward. (However, regarding interruptions there is a difference. See
paragraph 14)
10

[During Shemoneh Esrei, ] we must stand facing the Land of Israel, as it
is said: ""And they pray to You toward their land."" We should also face
Jerusalem, [the place of ] the Holy Temple and the Holy of Holies.
Therefore, we, in our country, who dwell West of the Land of Israel,
must stand facing Eastward. (Not exactly Eastward but toward
Southeast.) Those living North of the Land of Israel should face
Southward, and those living East, face Westward, and those living
South, face Northward. Thus, all Jews turn their faces toward one place
when they pray, namely toward Jerusalem and the Holy of Holies, for
there is the Gateway to Heaven, through which all prayers ascend.
Therefore, the Holy Temple is called talpiyos, as it is written: ""Your neck
is like the tower of David, built magnificently."" It is the hill to which all
mouths turn. Should you be praying in a place in which you are unable
to face the Land of Israel, you should direct your heart [thoughts] to
your Father in Heaven, as it is said: ""And they pray unto God."" If you
were facing North or South and remembered during the Shemoneh Esrei
that you were not standing correctly, you should not shift your feet, but
turn your face Eastward. If you are unable to do so, or if you are facing
Westward, you may conclude your prayers in this position and direct





your heart [thoughts] towards the Holy of Holies, but do not shift your
feet. Also, if you pray in a place where there are pictures on the Eastern
wall, you may pray facing any side, even though it is not East.
11

You must bend your knees and bow four times during the Shemoneh
Esrei, at the beginning of the first berachah and at its conclusion, and at
the berachah of Modim, at its beginning and end. When saying Baruch,
bend your knees; and when you say atah bow until the vertebrae of the
spinal column protrude, and you must also bow your head. Before
pronouncing the Name [Hashem], straighten up slowly (as it is said;)
""Hashem straightens the bent."" Similarly, when saying Modim, bend
your knees and bow, and before pronouncing the Name [Hashem], you
should straighten up. Do not bend too low, so that your mouth is
opposite your belt, because this is an act of ostentation. For an old
person or an invalid to whom bending the knees is painful, just
nodding the head is sufficient. It is forbidden to bow additionally at the
other berachos, either at their beginning or their end.

12

After the Shemoneh Esrei recite the prayer, Elokai Netzor. Before saying
Oseh Shalom, bow and take three steps backward, in the manner of a
servant taking leave of his master. These steps should be of average size,
the minumum of which is that the toe should touch the heel. Do not
take large steps, and do not take more than three steps. Step back with
your left foot first and then with the right foot, then step back again
with the left foot. While still bowed, turn your face to the left, which is
to the right of the Divine Presence which is before you at the time of
prayer, and when you step back from [your position of ] prayer you
should say: Oseh shalom Bimeromav; turn your face to the right which is
to the left of the Divine Presence, and say: Hu ya'aseh shalom aleinu,





then bow forward and say: ve'al kol Yisrael ve'imeru Amein. Then
straighten up and say: Yehi ratzon… sheyiboneh Beis Hamikdash.
Because prayer takes the place of sacrifices, we pray for the rebuilding
of the Holy Temple, so that we might do the actual service speedily in
our days. The reason for taking the first step with the left foot is
because people usually start walking by moving the right foot first, and
therefore we take our first step with the left foot, as though to indicate
how difficult it is to leave the Presence of God, blessed is He. Therefore
a left-footed person, should move his [so called] left foot first [which is
actually his right or weaker foot] which corresponds to everybody else's
right.
13

At the place where your three steps end, you should remain standing,
feet together, as when you were praying. Do not turn your face toward
the West, and do not return to your place until the chazzan says
Kedushah. Similarly, when praying privately, you should remain
standing the same length of time. If the place is narrow and crowded,
or when Piyutim are recited, you may return to your place when the
chazzan begins the prayer.

14

When saying Shemoneh Esrei, you should not signal with your eyes, or
move your lips, or indicate with your fingers. You may not interrupt
even in response to Kaddish, Kedushah, or Barechu. You should remain
silent and concentrate on what is being said by the chazzan and the
congregation, and this will be accounted to you as if you had responded
and fulfilled your obligation; and nevertheless it is not considered an
interruption [of your Shemoneh Esrei.] However, when saying: Elokai
Netzor, interruptions are permitted for those things for which you may
interrupt in the middle of a section of the berachos of Shema, or the





Shema itself. (See Chapter 16) Nevertheless if possible you should first
recite: Yiheyu leratzon imrei fi; and if there is still time, you should also
take three steps backward.
15

Some are accustomed to say, immediately after Hamevareich es amo
Yisrael bashalom, the verse: Yiheyu leratzon etc. and then recite Elokai
netzor, followed by Yiheyu leratzon a second time, and this is the proper
way. It seems to me that in this manner, it is permissible to interrupt
the saying of Elokai netzor to answer Amein [to any berachah or
Kaddish.] Some hold that before saying the verse: Yiheyu leratzon, it is
advisable to recite a verse from the Torah or Prophets or from the
Writings which begins with the same letter that your name begins, and
ends with the same letter with which your name concludes. It seems to
me that if you say Yiheyu leratzon twice, the above mentioned verse
should be said before the second saying of Yiheyu leratzon.

16

It has already been clarified (Chapter 12: 3) that if you feel even the
slightest need to use the bathroom, you are forbidden to pray until you
purge yourself. This is certainly true of the Shemoneh Esrei, which you
may not pray when you feel the slightest need to use the bathroom,
until you purge yourself. However, if at first you didn't feel the need
but later while praying the Shemoneh Esrei, you felt the need, whether it
be to defecate or urinate, you should restrain yourself until the end of
Shemoneh Esrei. you should not interrupt even if the need is great. You
should rather restrain yourself as long as possible and not interrupt by
going out during the Shemoneh Esrei, until you have concluded [by
saying] Hamevareich es amo Yisrael bashalom.




17


If you feel that you are about to flatuate and cannot restrain yourself
[then] if you are praying at home (privately) you should move
backward four amos or [four amos] sideways, and flatuate, and wait
until the odor vanishes, then return to your [original] place and say:
""Master of [all] the worlds, You created us with many openings with
many hollows (blood vessels, ducts, etc.). Our shame and
embarrassment is obvious to You; shame and embarrassment during
our lifetime, gnats and worms in our death,"" and complete your prayer.
And if you flatuated in your place [of prayer] accidentally, or if you are
praying with a congregation [where] it would be embarassing to move
backwards [in the midst of Shemoneh Esrei], you are not required to
move or say the prayer: ""Master…,"" but you should wait until the odor
vanishes and then conclude your prayer.

18

It is forbidden to sit within four amos in front, behind or along side of a
person praying the Shemoneh Esrei prayer. But, if the person seated is
also engaged in that which is related to the ""Order of the prayers,"" he is
permitted [to remain seated]. There are [poskim] who are lenient [and
permit him to remain seated] even if he is not engaged in matters
relating to prayer, but is only studying Torah orally. But a God-fearing
man should not sit in front of a person praying the Shemoneh Esrei
prayer within his line of vision even if he (the seated person) is saying
Kerias Shema. But [to be seated] behind or alongside [a person praying
Shemoneh Esrei] is not objectionable, and it is permitted to stand in all
situations even in front of [the person praying].

19

If the one sitting [within four amos] is a weak [or sickly] person he
should not be chastised (corrected).




20


If the seated person was first, and afterwards the other one came to
stand and to pray [Shemoneh Esrei] alongside him or in front of him so
that the seated person is behind the person [praying], he need not
stand, because the second person came into his ""territory."" However [if
the second person] stood to pray [Shemoneh Esrei] behind him so that
the seated person is in front of him, he should use discretion and rise.
This applies only when he is praying at home, but if he is praying in a
house (room) assigned to a regular minyan, and certainly in a
synagogue that is designated for everyone [equally] to pray there even if
he was seated first he should rise since the place is designated for prayer
to everyone.

21

It is forbidden to pass within four amos in front of a person praying the
Shemoneh Esrei prayer. Therefore, if one prayed and concluded his
prayer, and the person standing behind him in prayer has not yet
completed [Shemoneh Esrei], he (the person in front) should not take
the [three backward] steps because, in essence [it would be considered]
as if he were passing in front of the person praying [Shemoneh Esrei].
But to pass by alongside, and certainly behind him, is permitted.




22


A person who has drunk intoxicating beverages, if he is incapable of
speaking before a great person and/or a dignitary, he is forbidden to
pray. If he transgressed and did pray, his prayer is an ""abomination,""
and he is required to repeat his prayer when ""his wine is removed from
him."" If, by then, the time of that prayer has passed, he must ""make
up"" [the missed prayer] at the next prayer, according to the law [of a
person who missed a prayer] inadvertently or by accident, as explained
further on in chapter 21.

There are seasons of the year when special prayers are added to the Shemoneh Esrei.
This chapter deals with three such additions: Mashiv haruach, tal u'motor, and yaaleh
v'yovoh. It also deals with the laws of Aneinu which is said on Fast days.

During the winter we add mashiv haruach (Causer of the wind to blow)
umorid hageshem (and the rain to fall) to the second berachah of
Shemoneh Esrei. We begin (this addition) with the Musaf prayer of
Shemini Atzeres. The shamash (sexton) announces before [Musaf:]
Mashiv haruach umorid hageshem. If he did not announce it it is not
said then at the silent Musaf prayer. An ill person who prays at home
privately, likewise the villagers who have no minyan, should wait with
[their] Musaf prayers until the hour of which it is certain that the city
synagogues have completed Musaf prayers, and then they, too, can pray
Musaf and say mashiv haruach umorid hageshem. It (mashiv haruach…)
is said until Musaf of the first day of Pesach (Passover). The
congregation as well as the chazzan still say it during the silent prayer.
When the chazzan repeats [the Musaf prayer], he (the chazzan)
discontinues saying it, and after that the congregation does not say it at




the Minchah prayer, because they have already heard that the chazzan
has discontinued saying it. A person praying privately, should say the
Musaf prayer early enough, in order [to be sure] that the chazzan has
not yet discontinued saying it in the city synagogues, because whoever
prays [Musaf on the first day of Pesach] after the chazzan has
discontinued saying [mashiv haruach] at Musaf, no longer says it
[himself ]. There are congregations that add, mashiv haruach umorid
hatal during the summer. [In those places] the shamash should
announce it before Musaf on the first day of Pesach, and then the
[congregation] begins to say it in the silent [Shemoneh Esrei of Musaf,]
and they discontinue saying umorid hageshem.
2

If by mistake you did not say: mashiv haruach umorid hageshem, if you
remembered before you completed the berachah mechaye hameisim,
then you may say it at the place you remembered, but only if you are
not in mid-phrase. For instance, if you remembered after you said:
umekayim emunaso, (and fulfiller of His faithfulness) [you continue
and] say also i. e. lisheinei afar (to those who sleep in the dust) and
[then] you say mashiv haruach … [and continue] mi chamocha … (who
is like You). If you prefer, you may repeat the whole paragraph, that is,
mashiv haruach umorid hageshem, and then continue: mechalkeil chaim
… But, if you did not remember [the omission] until after you
completed the berachah: mechayei hameisim, you are required to return
to the beginning of Shemoneh Esrei. (And it will not suffice to begin
[again] [from] atah gibor (You are mighty), because the first three
berachos are considered as one [unit] in this regard, [meaning] that if
you completed [any] berachah [of these three] improperly, you must
return to the beginning of Shemoneh Esrei. If by error during the
Ma'ariv service of Pesach or during the Shacharis service or during





Musaf you failed to say it (mashiv haruach), you need not return to the
beginning to say it.
3

Some congregations add mashiv haruach umorid hatal, in the
summertime (see footnote 2.) If you erred and said it also during the
winter, or if you did not remember [that you should have said:…
umorid hageshem] until after you said Baruch atah Hashem, you should
complete the berachah mechayei hameisim. You are not required to
repeat the berachos in order to mention geshem, since you already
mentioned tal (dew). But if you remembered before you said Hashem,
(you said Baruch atah, but not yet Hashem) then you should say: morid
hageshem at the place you left off.

4

If you erred during the summer and said: mashiv haruach umorid
hageshem, if you remembered (realized your error) before you
completed the berachah, mechayei hameisim, you should go back and
begin Atoh gibor (i. e. the beginning of the berachah). (This is not
because the berachah is invalid, but so that it is apparent that the
berachah does not include mashiv haruach umorid hageshem). But if you
did not realize [your error] until after you completed [Baruch atah
Hashem] mechayei hameisim, you must return to the beginning of
Shemoneh Esrei. If you only said mashiv haruach [and realized your
error] and did not say morid hageshem, [the berachah] is not invalid at
all and you may continue mechalkeil chayim … If you erred at maariv
or in Shacharis of Shemini Atzeres and added (Mashiv haruach …) you
need not go back to the beginning.

5

Introduction: The sixth berachah of Shemoneh Esrei begins, ""Bareich aleinu …"" It is a
prayer for bountiful harvests and ample rainfall for the earth and its inhabitants.





Therefore, when the season for rain arrives, we add a special prayer for ""dew and rain""
(tal umatar).

We begin to say tal umatar in the Shemoneh Esrei of Maariv of the
sixtieth day after the Tishri (Fall) season, which comes on the fourth or
the fifth of December, and it is said, until [the first day of ] Pesach.
6

If you erred and did not say tal umatar: If you remembered before
ending the berachah of mevarech hashanim, say: [before the close of the
berachah] vesein tal umatar livrachah al pnei ha'adama vesabeinu … and
conclude [the berachah] properly (i. e. Baruch… mavarech hashanim).
If you did not remember until having completed the berachah,
continue on, and in the berachah of Shema koleinu, after the words:
""reikom al tisheveinu"" [""Do not turn us away empty-handed,""] say:
vesein tal umatar livrachah Ki atah shomea … And even if you did not
remember then, but only after you said, Baruch atah, as long as you had
not yet said Hashem, you may say: vesin tal umatar livrachah, ki ata
shomea … But, if you did not realize [that you forgot to add tal umatar]
until after you completed the berachah Shomea tefillah, [then] you must
go back and begin Bareich aleinu … And if you did not remember until
you said the verse [at the end of Shemoneh Esrei]: Yihyu le'ratzon … you
must go back to the very beginning of the Shemoneh Esrei.

7

If you erred during the summer and added tal umatar you must return
to the beginning [and say:] Bareich aleinu. But, if you did not realize
[that you added tal umatar] until after you said the verse, Yihyu
le'ratzon, you must go back to the beginning of the Shemoneh Esrei.

8

If you are in doubt [about] whether you added mashiv haruach or not,
[then] if thirty days have passed, [meaning:] you already said Shemoneh





Esrei ninety times properly, it can be assumed that now, too, you prayed
[and added mashiv haruach] by virtue of habit. But [if the doubt arose]
within [or before] thirty days [elapsed], you are required to repeat
Shemoneh Esrei. The same [rule applies] to tal umatar. If the doubt
arose after you already prayed ninety Shemoneh Esreis properly, we
presume that now, too, you prayed properly. But before that (before 30
days), you must repeat the Shemoneh Esrei.
9

If you erred at Maariv on the first night of Pesach, and you prayed the
Shemoneh Esrei of the weekdays, and you realized [your error] after you
began Bareich oleinu, the law being [that even having begun a berachah
in error] you must complete that full berachah, but do not add tal
umatar, since the congregation also omits it. If the she'eila (petition)
(that is, the day that we begin to pray— or ""petition"" for tal umatar)
falls on Shabbos, and by mistake you prayed [the Shemoneh Esrei] of the
weekdays and also began [the berachah] Bareich aleinu, you do not say
tal umatar, since the congregation has not yet started, and the
individual always follows the congregation.

10

If you forgot [to add] Yaaleh veyavo on Rosh Chodesh in the Shacharis or
Minchah service, or on Chol Hamo'ed either in Shacharis, Minchah, or
Maariv, if you realized [your error] before you said: Yihyu le'ratzon you
should go back and begin Retzeih. Even if you remembered before you
started Modim, as long as you have completed the berachah:
hamachazir shechinaso letzion, you must begin [again] at Retzeih, (as we
wrote, above, in regard to mashiv haruach). However, if your realized
before [completing] the berachah: hamachazir shechinaso letzion, you
say it there (at the point where you realized) and you conclude:
vesechezena eineinu … If you did not remember until after Yihyu





le'ratzon … you must go back to the beginning of Shemoneh Esrei. On
Rosh Chodesh [however,] if you forgot Yaaleh veyavo in the Maariv
service, whether Rosh Chodesh be two days or only one day, once you
[already] said: Baruch atah Hashem, and mentioned: Hashem, you no
longer need to go back, [to insert Yaaleh veyavo] but complete [the
berachah] hamachazir shechinaso letzion and [go on] to complete
Shemoneh Esrei. The reason for this [allowing the completion of
Shemoneh Esrei without Yaaleh veyavo] is because [Rosh Chodesh] was
not sanctified at night.
11

If you forgot to say Yaaleh veyavo on Rosh Chodesh or Chol Hamoed, in
Shacharis, although you did not realize it until after you prayed Musaf
(where you already mentioned Rosh Chodesh or the festival),
nevertheless, you are required to repeat the prayers of Shacharis. If the
time [of Shacharis] has passed you may compensate for it at Minchah.

12

Whenever you must repeat the Shemoneh Esrei prayer, you are required
to wait the time it takes to walk four amos.

13

If the chazzan erred during the silent Shemoneh Esrei, he does not repeat
Shemoneh Esrei because it would be a burden on the congregation, but
he may rely on the prayer that he will pray aloud. (Therefore, after he
repeats the Shemoneh Esrei [aloud] he should say: Elokai netzor… and
step back three paces.) But if he erred in the first three berachos and
realized it before he completed his [silent] Shemoneh Esrei, in a manner
that his repetition will not constitute a burden on the congregation, he
should go back and repeat Shemoneh Esrei.




14


On fast days, whether a communal fast day or a private fast day, we add
aneinu to the Minchah prayer in the berachah Shema koleinu. After
reciting the words: bechol eis tzarah vetzukah, we conclude: ki atah
shomea … If you forgot to say aneinu, and you did not remember until
after you said: [Baruch Atah] Hashem of the berachah Shomea tefillah,
you do not repeat [the berachah] to say [aneinu.] But rather after
completing the entire Shemoneh Esrei, after Elokai netzor, before you
move your feet, you say it (the aneinu prayer) until [the closing words]:
bechol eis tzarah vetzukah and [then] conclude [with the usual] Yihyu
le'ratzon …. If you did not remember until after you moved your feet
[back] you no longer say it (aneinu).
"
"1

When the chazzan steps back upon completing the silent Shemoneh
Esrei, he remains standing there for the time it takes to walk four amos,
returns to his original place and says quietly: Hashem sefasai tiftach …
and begins aloud: Baruch atah Hashem. Everyone [in the congregation]
must be careful to remain silent, (during the repetition of Shemoneh
Esrei), to listen carefully and be attentive [to] what (the chazzan is
saying, and to say Baruch hu uvaruch shemo and Amein after each
berachah. Even the study [of Torah] is prohibited while the chazzan is
repeating the [Shemoneh Esrei] prayer; and needless to say that you must
take care to avoid idle conversation. If it is not difficult for you, it is
proper to stand as if you yourself are praying Shemoneh Esrei; your eyes
either closed or following the chazzan's chanting in the siddur. There
are some whose custom it is that after the Kedusha, they remove the





Rashi tefillin and put on Rabbeinu Tam tefillin. But what they do is not
in accordance with the law.
2

Since the chazzan has already prayed his own prayer silently and is
repeating Shemoneh Esrei only for the benefit of the listeners, it is,
therefore, required that during the repetition of Shemoneh Esrei, there
be no less than nine listening [to the chazzan] and answering [Amein]
lest his berachos be in vain. Therefore, when there is an exact minyan,
care should be taken that the chazzan not begin the repetition of
Shemoneh Esrei until all have completed their [silent] Shemoneh Esrei so
that they are able to answer [Amein].

3

The chazzan must be careful when completing a berachah, not to begin
the following berachah until after most of the congregation have
answered Amein. If he did begin the next berachah immediately, for
instance, after completing [the berachah] Magein Avraham he began to
say Atah gibor at once, then since he already started saying Atah gibor,
no longer [does the congregation] say Amein."" The penalty for vacating
the Amein is now upon him (the chazzan).

4

When the Kedusha [is said], you should be careful to join your feet so
that both are together as if they were one foot, as it is written [of the
angels who say Kedusha] ""And their feet (plural) are a straight foot""
(singular). When saying: Kadosh, kadosh, kadosh, also Baruch [kevod
Hashem mimekomo], and Yimloch [Hashem leolam …] you should raise
your body and heels upward. It is the custom to raise the eyes upward
[during Kedusha], and preferrably they should be closed.




5


When the chazzan reaches [the berachah] modim, the entire
congregation bows and says the entire modim derabanan in a bowed
posture. If you are standing [in the midst of ] the Shemoneh Esrei prayer
and you hear the chazzan about to say modim, if you are in the midst of
a berachah, you should also bow. But if you are at the beginning or end
of a berachah, you should not bow, because it is prohibited to add
bowings either at the beginning or end of a berachah besides those that
were ordained by our Rabbis, of blessed memory. See chapter 18,
paragraph 11.

6

Before the chazzan starts [the berachah] Sim shalom, he says Elokeinu
veilokei avoseinu barcheinu … when he reaches veyishmerecha, the
congregation responds, Kein yehi ratzon and does not say Amein. The
same applies when he reaches vichuneka and shalom. It [the Birchas
Kohanim] is said only at Shacharis and Musaf prayers, but not at
Minchah, with the exception of a communal fast day when we say Sim
shalom at Minchah; then the chazzan also says: Elokeinu veilokei
avoseinu …. It is not said [at the minyan] at the house of a mourner nor
on Tisha Be'av at Shacharis.

7

After the chazzan completes the Shemoneh Esrei he should say quietly
Yihyu leratzon … but he need not step back three paces because he may
rely on the paces at the end of the full Kaddish.

8

If there are ten [men, a minyan], in the synagogue, on a communal fast
day who are fasting and completing [the fast], the chazzan adds the
prayer aneinu before Refa'einu at Shacharis and Minchah. If he erred
and did not say it, if he realized [his omission] before he said ""Hashem""





of the berachah: Rofei cholei amo Yisrael, he goes back and says aneinu
and [then] Refa'einu. But, if he did not realize [his omission] until after
he said ""Hashem,"" he completes the berachah Rofei cholei amo Yisrael,
and says aneinu in the midst of the berachah Shomea tefillah, and closes
the berachah [with] [Baruch atah Hashem] shomea tefillah, as would an
individual. If he also forgot there, he adds it after completing Shemoneh
Esrei but without a closing berachah.
9

We do not repeat the Shemoneh Esrei aloud, unless there are at least six
men who constitute a majority of the minyan, who have finished
praying. But, if there aren't six men who are now praying, we do not
repeat the entire Shemoneh Esrei aloud. Instead, one [of those praying]
says [from the beginning of Shemoneh Esrei] until Ha'el hakadosh aloud,
and everyone says Kedusha, and [the one who said the berachos aloud]
completes his Shemoneh Esrei quietly.

10

In all cases where the individual who erred goes back [and repeats] the
Shemoneh Esrei, so too, if the chazzan erred in the repetition of
Shemoneh Esrei, he must repeat the Shemoneh Esrei [aloud], except at
Shacharis of Rosh Chodesh and Chol Hamoed. There [if the chazzan]
forgot to say Yaaleh veyavo and did not realize it until he completed the
[loud] Shemoneh Esrei, he does not go back, for since [it would result
in] an imposition on the congregation, we rely on the reference [to Rosh
Chodesh] [to be said] in the Musaf prayer. But if the chazzan realized
[his omission] before he completed the Shemoneh Esrei, he goes back to
[the berachah] Retzei as this [would not constitute] a burden on the
congregation.




11


It is incumbent upon every man to say Kedusha together with the
congregation; and also the Amein which is said after [the berachah]
Ha'el Hakadosh and after [the berachah] Shomea tefillah. These Ameins
are obligations equivalent to Kedusha. Likewise it is obligatory to
respond to the kaddeishim which the chazzan says. Also [when the
chazzan says] Modim you are obligated to bow together with the
congregation. Therefore, if you were late in coming to the synagogue,
having arrived too late to catch up and pray the Shemoneh Esrei together
with the congregation and will perforce pray Shemoneh Esrei
individually, if [by waiting still longer to start] the time for tefillah will
not pass, you must be mindful not to begin praying Shemoneh Esrei at a
time [which will cause you] to lose the opportunity of answering
[Amein] to any of the above. Rather you should wait until you respond
[Amein to them] and then start to pray Shemoneh Esrei. But, you should
not wait between ga'al Yisrael and [the start of ] Shemoneh Esrei, for you
are required to connect ""the Redemption"" to the Shemoneh Esrei, and it
is forbidden to interrupt between them. But you should [rather] wait
[silently] before [saying] Shirah Chadashah.




12


An individual standing in [silent] Shemoneh Esrei, who completes the
berachah, mechayei hameisim [as] the congregation is saying the Kedusha
in Uva Letzion or the Kedusha [in the berachah] Yotzer or should not say
kadosh, kadosh, kadosh, with them because these kedushos are not the
same as the Kedusha of Shemoneh Esrei. But, if the congregation is
saying the Kedusha of Musaf, though he is praying Shacharis, he says
kadosh,kadosh, kadosh. along with them. The same [applies] in reverse,
because the Kedusha of Shacharis and the Kedusha of Musaf are the same
[kedusha].

Preface:
The general rule is that omitting one of the prayers requires a make-up-prayer. This
will compensate for having omitted a tefillah, but only where the omission occurred
omitted a tefillah, there is no way to compensate. An important fact to keep in mind
while studying this chapter: The compensation tefillah is performed by repeating the
particular tefillah that is due at that time. For example, if at Maariv one compensates
for an omitted Mincha, he does this by praying two Maariv Shemoneh Esrei's. Due to
this, a number of unique situations arise: e. g. Omitting Mincha on Friday afternoon
requires two Maariv Shemoneh Esreis on Friday night, both, being the Shabbos eve
Shemoneh Esreis.This chapter discusses the form this compensation takes as well as
what is considered deliberate and what is considered unintentional and unwilling.

It has already been explained (in Chapter Eighteen) that if [you
allowed] the time of tefillah to pass intentionally, there is no
compensation. But if [it was] unintentional, or due to something
beyond your control, that you did not pray, or [if you did pray, but]




erred in your tefillah in a way that requires that you repeat the tefillah,
[then] you may compensate for it following the next tefillah. You must
first pray the tefillah that is due at that time and [only] afterwards the
make-up tefillah, for example: if you did not pray the Shacharis tefillah,
then when the time for Minchah arrives, you first pray a tefillah for
Minchah, followed by the Tachanun prayer, and immediately afterwards
you should say Ashrei, and then pray another Shemoneh Esrei for the
sake of [the omitted] Shacharis. [Similarly] if you omitted Minchah,
then you should first say the Maariv prayer, and then pause only for the
time it takes to walk four amos, do not say Ashrei, but, immediately,
pray the Shemoneh Esrei prayer for the sake of [the omitted] Minchah.
[Similarly] if you omitted Maariv, then after the Shacharis prayer you
should say Tachanun and Ashrei, and [then] pray the Shemoneh Esrei
prayer for the sake of Maariv. After that you should say Lamenatzeiach
and Uva letzion, etc. You may not eat until you also complete the
make-up tefillah, which is for the sake of Maariv.
2

If you did not pray when there was time to pray, because you thought
that there would still be time after you finished whatever you were
doing, but in the meantime the time [for prayer] passed; similarly, if
you were preoccupied in business matters, in order to prevent a loss,
and as a result the time for prayer passed, [then] despite the fact that it
is prohibited to allow the time of prayer to pass [merely] to avoid a
monetary loss, nevertheless, it is considered oneis, (an extreme situation)
and you may make up the missed prayer. Similarly if as a result of
intoxication you were not permitted to pray, you are considered an
oneis, despite the fact that drinking is prohibited once the time for
prayer has arrived.




3


Compensation for [an omitted] prayer is valid only at the very next
tefillah, but if the delay was greater, [compensation] is no longer
possible. For example: if you did not pray Shacharis and Minchah, then
compensation for Minchah is possible [immediately] after Maariv, but
for Shacharis, compensation is not possible, since two periods of prayer
have passed [and] you failed to pray [Shacharis], neither at its
(Shacharis') designated time nor at the time of Minchah.

4

However, on a day when there is an additional Musaf prayer, if you
omitted Shacharis [unintentionally], you may compensate for it after
the Minchah prayer, (because the period for Musaf extends, as a last
resort, until nightfall as does [the period] for Minchah; as a result, two
periods of tefillah have not passed). But, after the Musaf prayer you may
not compensate for [the omitted] Shacharis, (because having already
mentioned the Musaf sacrifice, it is inappropriate as a make up for the
Shacharis prayer). But, if the Shacharis period has not yet passed, you
may still pray the Shacharis prayer despite already having prayed Musaf.

5

The omitted tefillah can be made up only at the time of the next
tefillah, but not after the time of the next tefillah. For example: if much
time has elapsed since you prayed the tefillah which was due at that
time, you can no longer pray the compensatory tefillah for the one
omitted, because [the Sages] instituted compensation for the omitted
tefillah only at the time you are occupied with the prayer due then,
because [only] while being occupied with prayers can you also make up
[for] what you missed.




6


The make-up tefillah that you pray must be the same as the tefillah that
is due at that time. For example, if you omitted Mincha on Friday
afternoon, [then] you pray two Shabbos-Maariv tefillos at Maariv,
notwithstanding the fact that the second tefillah comes as compensation
for a weekday tefillah, nevertheless, since now (at the time of the makeup tefillah) it is Shabbos, you pray a Shabbos tefillah. If [being ignorant
of the above halachah] you said a weekday tefillah as compensation you
must repeat [the Shabbos] Shemoneh Esrei. Similarly, on the day
preceeding Rosh Chodesh, if you omitted Minchah [then] you pray two
Maariv Shemoneh Esreis and at both you say Ya'aleh ve'yavo. If you
omitted Maariv on Rosh Chodesh, requiring you to pray two Shacharis
tefillos, and if you inadvertently omitted Ya'aleh ve'yavo even during the
second [Shemoneh Esrei] you must repeat the Shemoneh Esrei; (despite
the fact that it is compensation for the night and, then, [had you
omitted Ya'aleh ve'yavo] you were not required to repeat [the tefillah],
nevertheless, now it is day.) If you omitted Minchah, on Shabbos here,
too, you pray two weekday [Shemoneh Esreis] at Maariv. However [in
this case] there is a difference [regarding] the Atah Chonantanu prayer.
In the first Shemoneh Esrei you should say Atash Chonantanu, but in the
second prayer, you do not say it. The reason for this is since Atah
Chonantanu is like the Havadlah blessing, and Havdalah is not said
twice in tefillah. The same applies in the opposite situation: If you
omitted Maariv at the conclusion of Shabbos, [then,] you pray two
Shacharis Shemoneh Esreis and during the make-up prayer say Atah
Chonantanu, because originally it was instituted that Havdalah be said
during Shemoneh Esrei.




7


If you erred at Minchah on Rosh Chodesh by omitting Ya'aleh ve'yavo,
and the following day it is not Rosh Chodesh, and as a result, even if you
pray two [Shemoneh Esreis] at Maariv, you will gain nothing, since you
can no longer say Ya'aleh ve'yavo, and you already prayed once without
Ya'aleh ve'yavo, therefore, you do not pray a make-up tefillah at all.

8

Regarding the Musaf prayer—although its time period is the entire day
(till nightfall), thereby making Maariv the next tefillah, nevertheless it
[musaf] cannot be compensated at night, because the musaf prayer was
instituted based on the verse. ""Let the offerings of our lips replace
bullocks,"" and once the time has passed the sacrifice can no longer be
brought.

9

If you require two Shacharis tefillos or two Minchah tefillos, and you are
the chazzan, you fulfill your obligation with the repeating of Shemoneh
Esrei aloud.

10

If you are in doubt as to whether or not you prayed, in our time (since
a voluntary Shemoneh Esrei is not said) you do not repeat the tefillah.

Preface
Jews, symbolically, also assume these three positions during prayer by: 1) sitting before
falling on the face) after the Amidah. This is called tachanun (Supplication). (Based on





Tur 131).Originally nefilas apayim was performed by entirely prostrating one's body
upon the ground while praying and pleading for one's needs. However, with the
destruction of the Temple this practice was discouraged. Also, the Talmud (Megillah
22a ) states that only a righteous person comparable to Joshua, who is assured of a

response to a prayer in this manner, may assume this position in prayer.Therefore, the
custom has become to perform nefilas apayim only perfunctorily by sitting and tilting
one's head downward (Aruch Hashulchan 131: 4).

Upon completing the shemoneh esrei, tachanun is said with nefilas
apayim (falling on the face). Idle talk is prohibited between shemoneh
esrei and tachanun.
2

During the shacharis [morning prayers] when tefillin are worn on the
left hand, [tachanun is said] leaning on the right [hand] out of respect
for the tefillin. But at the minchah prayers the leaning is on the left
[hand].

3

Nefilas apayim is preferably done while sitting. But, when necessary it
may be done while standing. After tachanun Ve'ananchnu lo neida is
said. It is preferable that it be said while sitting, afterwards you should
stand [and continue] saying: mah na'aseh …

4

Nefilas apayim is done only in a place where a Seifer Torah is present.
Where there is no Seifer Torah, even though there are other sacred
books there, nefilas apayim is not done but, instead, the psalm is said
without nefilas apayim. When praying in the synagogue vestibule and
the door to the synagogue is open, it is considered as if the Seifer Torah
is there.




5


When praying in the house of a mourner or in the house of the
deceased, even if there is no mourner present, tachanun is not said
during the seven days of mourning, even at minchah of the seventh day.
It is customary, that even if the mourners return home they do not say
Tachanun. If a mourner is present in the synagogue [during prayers] the
congregation is not drawn after him and they do say tachanun, whereas,
the mourner, does not.

6

Tachanun is omitted in a synagogue where a circumcision will take
place, or if the father of the child to be circumcised, or the sandik who
holds the child at the circumcision; or the mohel is praying there, even
if the circumcision will take place at another location. If the minchah
prayer is said, in the child's home, before the bris feast or during the
feast [there,] too, [tachanun] is omitted. But, if [the mincha] prayer is
said after birkas hamazon [tachanun] is said. However, the father of the
child, the one holding the child and the mohel do not say [tachanun]
even after birkas hamazon because it is their holiday

7

Likewise, [tachanun] is omitted in a synagogue where a groom is
present, during all seven days of feasting, provided that the groom was a
bochur or the bride a besulah. But if a widower married a widow there
are only three days, after which [tachanun] is resumed. On the day of
the marriage ceremony [tachanun] is said at shacharis prayers, but at the
minchah preceeding the ceremony it is not said.

8

Tachanun is not said on the following days: Rosh Chodesh, the fifteenth
of Av, the fifteenth of Shevat, during Chanukah, the two days of greater
Purim, the two days of minor Purim, the thirty-third day of the Omer,





during the entire month of Nissan, Tishah Be'Av, the days between Yom
Kippur and Sukkos, from Rosh Chodesh Sivan until the day following
the day after Shavuos, the day following Succos. On all these days
tachanun is also not said at minchah on the preceeding days. However,
on the day before erev Rosh Hashanah, and on the day before erev Yom
Kippur, Tachanun is said at Minchah. On the day before Rosh Hashana
[tachanun] is said at selichos, but after that [tachanun] is omitted.
9

On Mondays and Thursdays, are especially favorable days [for prayer]
because during the forty days the second luchos were received, Moses
ascended on a Thursday and descended on a Monday, therefore,
additional supplications are recited and before tachanun, vehu rachum is
said. It (vehu rachum) is said standing. It must be said with
concentration and with deliberation in a pleading manner. On days
when tachanun is omitted it (vehu rachum) is not said.

10

After tachanun [is completed] half-kaddish is said. On Mondays and
Thursdays Keil erech apayim is said while standing.
"
"1

When the Seifer Torah (Torah Scroll) is taken from the Aron Hakodesh
(Holy Ark) to be carried to the reader's lectern where the reading takes
place, it is to be carried toward the north, that is, to the right of the
carrier. When it is returned to the Aron Hakodesh, it is carried toward
the south. The Seifer Torah must be held in the right hand [when it is
carried]. It is a mitzvah for everyone before whom the Seifer Torah
passes, to accompany it to the reader's lectern.




2


The oleh [person called up] to the Torah should wear a tallis with
tzitzis. He should take the shortest route and return [to his seat] via the
longest route. If both routes are of equal distance, [then] he ascends to
the right and descends by the other route. It is customary to wait until
the person called after him has completed the last berachah, then he
descends between readings.

3

Open the Seifer Torah and look at the place to be read and hold it open
with both hands. [Then] close your eyes and say: Barechu es Hashem
Hamevorach. You should say this loud enough for the entire
congregation to hear. They respond: Baruch Hashem hamevorach leolam
va'ed. If the congregation did not hear you say Barechu …, even though
they heard the reader responding, [nevertheless,] they do not respond
with him. Instead, after the reader has responded, they respond: Amein
[to the reader]. After the congregation has responded: Baruch Hashem
hamevorach leolam va'ed, [you] the oleh also repeat: Baruch Hashem
hamevorach leolam va'ed, and then recite the berachah asher bachar
banu… after which the congregation responds: Amein. You then
remove your left hand and hold the Seifer Torah with your right hand
during the reading. [Now,] the reader reads and you read along quietly.
The Reader may not [begin to] read until the congregation completes
saying Amein. The entire congregation should be attentive and listen
carefully to the Torah reading. After [the completion of ] the reading,
you [the oleh] again hold it (the Seifer Torah) also with your left hand,
roll [the Torah] closed and recite the last berachah.

4

It is forbidden to hold the Seifer Torah with bare hands. Rather, you
should hold it by means of the tallis or hold it by its poles. There are





some who refrain from touching even the poles with bare hands, only
with the tallis.
5

The oleh as well as the reader is required to stand. It is even forbidden
to lean on something for we must stand in awe; for just as the Torah
was given in awe, so too, must we conduct ourselves concerning it in
awe. However, a weak person may lean a little for support.

6

While the oleh recites Barechu … and the congregation says: Baruch
Hashem hamevorach leolam va'ed the entire congregation should stand.
But, while he recites the berachah: asher bachar banu as well as during
the reading and the last berachah, the congregation is not obliged to
stand. But, those who are scrupulous [in their observance of ] mitzvos,
demand more of themselves and stand, and this is appropriate. But,
between readings there is no need whatsoever to be stringent.

7

If the reader himself is called up as the oleh, another person should
stand at his side for just as the Torah was given through an intermediary
that is, Moshe Rabbeinu (may he rest in peace), so, too, should we
conduct ourselves [to hear the reading] with an intermediary.

8

Once the reader has begun to read, the entire congregation is forbidden
to indulge in conversation even about Torah subjects. Conversation is
forbidden even between readings. It is forbidden to leave the synagogue
while the Torah is being read. But, between readings, when the Seifer
Torah is rolled up one may leave if the need is great.

9

If there is a Kohein present in the synagogue he must be called [to the
reading] first. Even if he is an unlearned person, provided he is an
upright person, he has preference over a [Torah] scholar. Even if the





Kohein wants to forgo [his right] he may not do so. After the Kohein, a
Leivi is called. If there is no Leivi present, the Kohein who was called
[first] is called [again] in his (the Leivi's) stead, and [the gabbai]
announces: ""Instead of a Leivi."" If a Kohein is not present in the
synagogue, a Leivi or Yisrael is called in his stead; and in such a case we
should call the most learned in Torah among those present, and [the
gabbai] announces: ""If there is no Kohein present, a Leivi instead of a
Kohein,"" or: ""a Yisrael instead of a Kohein."" When a Yisroel is called in
place of a Kohein, a Leivi is not called afterwards. A community made
up of only Kohanim or Levi'im should put the question to a learned
sage as to how to conduct themselves.
10

If the Kohein is in mid-Kerias Shema, or in the middle of the berachos of
Kerias Shema and, certainly, if he is in mid-Shemoneh Esrei, even if there
is no other Kohein present, he should not be called [to the Torah]. And
there is no need to wait for him for [this would be] an imposition on
the congregation. Rather a Leivi or Yisrael is called, and [the gabbai
then] does not say: ""If there is no Kohein present"" but, [instead] says:
""Leivi or Yisrael instead of a Kohein."" If it happened that the Kohein was
called—if he was in mid-Kerias Shema or its berachos, he may go up and
recite the berachos, but he may not read along with the reader, he may
only listen. However, if at all possible, he should finish the subject in
which he is in the middle, and stop at a place where the subject ends
before he goes up [to the Torah]. If he is in mid-Shemoneh Esrei, [then]
even if he was called he may not go up. Similarly, between Go'al Yisrael
and Shemoneh Esrei, he may not go up. [However, if he is in the midst
of ] the prayer: Elokay netzor … he may go up. If he is in mid-Pesukei
D'zimrah, if there is no other Kohein present, he may, even initially, be
called. But, he may not read with the Reader. However, if there is





another [Kohein] present, he should not initially be called. [All of the
above] also applies to Leivi.
11

If a Kohein or Leivi was called and [it is discovered] that he is not
present, another should not be called by name, so that it should not be
said the first one's lineage is defective. Instead, to the second one say:
""You, go up,"" and he should go up. However, if [in his absence] they
call his son he may be called by name for this would not [be
misconstrued], as a defect in the father's [lineage], for if the fathers
lineage were defective then the son's would also be defective. Similarly,
if the Kohein or the Leivi cannot go up [to the Seifer Torah] because he
is in mid-Shemoneh Esrei, another may be called by name, for all can see
that the former Kohein does not go up [only] because he is not
permitted to do so. If a Yisrael is called up and is not present, another
may be called by name because where a Yisrael is involved, ""defective
lineage"" has no application. Similarly, if a Kohein or Leivi were called
up for acharon or maftir on Shabbos or Yom Tov and they are not
present, another may be called by name.

12

If there is no Kohein in the synagogue, or if there was, he was unknown
to anyone, and a Yisrael is called in his stead and he (the Yisrael) came
up, [then] even if he had already said: Barechu es Hashem hamevorach,
but he had not begun the berachah: asher bachar banu, and [just then]
the Kohein arrived or it was realized that he is present, the Kohein is
called and he goes up, and he, too, begins: Barechu etc. In order to
avoid embarassment the Yisrael should stand there until after the
Kohein and Leivi are called, and then he is called. However, if the
Yisrael had already said Hashem (God's name) in the berachah, that is,
he has said: Bauch Atah Hashem … [then] the Kohein no longer goes





up. The same applies if a Leivi is called instead of a Kohein, and the
Kohein arrived before the Leivi said: Baruch Atah Hashem, [then] the
Kohein goes up and the Leivi waits and he is called after him. The same
applies if no Leivi is present, or if he was unknown to anyone, and the
Kohein was called also in place of the Leivi, then the Leivi arrived before
the Kohein said: Baruch Atah Hashem, the Leivi is called and he goes up.
13

Two brothers should not be called [consecutively] one after the other,
whether they are [brothers] from the same father or from the same
mother. Similarly, a father and his son or [a grandfather and] his
grandson, should not be called one after the other for fear of an ""evil
eye;"" even if they profess not to mind. [This applies] even if the first is
[called] for acharon and the second for maftir; but only on a Shabbos,
when another Seifer Torah is not taken out for the maftir. However,
when another Seifer Torah is taken out for maftir, it is permitted [to call
consecutively two brothers or father and son]. Similarly, [when the one
called] to maftir is not yet bar mitzvah (13 years old), it is permitted. In
all the above situations, if they have already called him and he has gone
up [to the Torah,] he should not descend (from the bimah). If two
brothers who only have the same mother, [but have different fathers,]
or a father and his grandson, were [already] called, though they have
not yet come up, they may ascend [to the bimah]. When necessary it is
permitted, even initially for them to be called consecutively.

14

One who was an oleh in one synagogue, and happens to be present at
another synagogue, where he is called up again, even to the same
parshah to which he was called before, should go up a second time and
recite the berachos [over the Torah].




15


On a communal fast-day when Vayechal is read, only one who is fasting
is called to the Torah. If the only Kohein present is not fasting, or does
not intend to complete [the fast], a Yisrael or a Leivi is called in his
stead. And it is preferable that the Kohein leave the synagogue. If
another Kohein is present, it is not required that he leave, but he should
notify them not to call him, and if he is called he should not ascend [to
the bimah]. On Mondays and Thursdays, though the reading is
Vayechal, nevertheless, since it is a time for reading the Torah, therefore,
after the fact, if the [Kohein who is not fasting] has not left the
synagogue, and he is called, he may go up.

16

Similarly, when one who resides in Eretz Yisrael, where Yom Tov is
celebrated only one day, (with the exception of Rosh Hashanah) is
visiting a foreign land, and is present in the synagogue on the second
day of Yom Tov, he should not be called up to the Torah. The rules are
as stated in the previous paragraph.

17

It is customary to call a blind person [to the reading of the Torah].
Although, it is prohibited to read the written Torah by heart,
nevertheless, since nowadays the reader reads for him, it is permitted.
We do not investigate whether [the oleh] is learned or not, because it
may be assumed that he is capable of reading along with the reader.

18

If the place to be read was shown to the oleh and he recited the blessing,
and then it was realized that it was not the [right] place, but, rather,
another place is to be read, regardless if the reading has started or has
not started, [the following must be considered:] if the place [in the
Torah] that was to be read was also open before him, [during the





berachah], even if it is in another column [as long as it was] past the
place that was shown to him, he need not recite a second berachah,
because his mind was on the place on which he intended the berachah
as well as on whatever was opened before him. But, if the place was not
open before him, and they must now roll the Seifer Torah [to the proper
place], or even if the place was open before him, but it is located before
the place that was shown to him; he must recite the berachah: asher
bachar banu a second time. But, Barechu [es Hashem hamevorach]
should not be said a second time. He must first (before repeating the
berachah) say: Baruch sheim kevod malchuso leolam va'ed on the first
berachah which was recited in vain. If [the error was realized] when he
had said only: Baruch atah Hashem. then he should conclude…
lamdeinu chukecha. If the place to be read precedes the place shown
him, but is close enough to it, and so situated to make it possible that
three verses can also be read from the place [upon which] he said the
berachah and further, [and with the condition that] it is all included in
that day's portion, then this should be done in order to avoid a second
berachah.
19

Every oleh must read at least three verses. On Mondays and Thursdays
and at the Shabbos Minchah service, it is required that in all no less
than ten verses be read. We should read a minimum of four verses for
the third oleh. If it happened that in all only nine verses were read, i. e.,
three for each oleh, the obligation is fulfilled. On Purim, we read only
nine verses for all [the olim] combined because the subject matter ends
[after nine verses].

Preface:
As we look into a Seifer Torah we become aware of gaps and spaces in the text. This, as





many of the laws and traditions concerning the writing of Sifrei Torah, has been
handed down to us from generation to generation, originating from the giving of the
Torah at Mt. Sinai. Each of these text-breaks denotes the completion of a chapter.
(This should not be confused with the numbered chapters and verses that are found
in the printed Scriptures, for these are attributed to non-Jewish sources).
mid-line and the remainder of the line is left open with the text resuming at the
and after the gap, the text resumes on the same line, in effect ""closing the line.""
Paragraph 20 concerns precautions taken to avoid the impression that less than three
verses may ever be read for any one oleh.

The one who reads the Torah must not conclude [his reading] at a place
from where there will not remain a minimum of three verses, from
there until the end of that parshah, that is a pesuchah or a sesumah. If
the oleh had already recited the last berachah after [the reader]
completed [the reading] with less than three verses left to the end of
that parshah, then the following reading need not begin with the
preceding verse, but should start where the previous one left off, and
continue to read with him at least three more verses in the following
parshah. If a parshah only has two verses, it is permitted to end there. If
there is a parshah-break in mid-verse, as there is in the beginning of
Parshas Pinchos, the reading may end even at the very next verse.
21

Similarly, [the reader] should not begin with fewer than three verses
after the beginning of that parshah. Consequently, the previous oleh
should not end within three verses of the beginning of the next parshah.

22

The reader should always aim to begin reading with a subject favorable
for Israel and to end with a subject favorable for Israel. Likewise, he





should not end where the evil deed of someone is recorded.
23

If only two verses were read for an oleh, and he already recited the last
berachah, the reading must be repeated and the first and last berachos
must be repeated. And, since upon the completion of the last berachah
his mind was diverted [from the reading], therefore, he must begin
again at Barechu … and the two verses already read should be repeated
plus one more verse [to complete the three]. If this [error] occurred at
the third aliyah [and for the two preceeding (olim) only three verses
were read for each], two more verses must be read so that the total is
four verses. If this [error] occured at the Kohein's aliyah that only two
verses were read, and the Leivi has already been called, and then they
remembered [the error] then the rules are as follows: if the Leivi has not
yet recited the first berachah though he may have already said Barechu
…, it is not considered the start of the berachah. Therefore, three verses
should be re-read for the Kohein, with the appropriate berachos, as we
have previously written. The Leivi [who was called] waits and he reads
afterwards. But, if the Leivi already said the first berachah, then the
Leivi's reading begins from the place that the Kohein's ended. [This is
done] because if the reading for the Leivi includes [the two verses] of
the Kohein's reading, it will be construed as a defect for the Kohanim
who are present there, because [those who have just entered] will say
that the Leivi began the reading of the Torah. After the Leivi, two
Yisraels should be called up, so that the minimum of three are called up.
The Kohein's [aliyah] does not count since only two verses were read for
him. If this [error] occurred at the Leivi's aliyah, that only two verses
were read and the Yisrael has said the [first] berachah, [then] we read
for the Yisrael the two verses which were read for the Leivi plus one
more verse. [Then] one more Yisrael is called up to complete [the





required] three aliyos. If a Kohein was not present in the synagogue and
a Yisrael was called instead, and the same happened [to him] [that is,]
only two verses were read for him, and they did not realize it until after
they called a second Yisrael and [the second Yisrael] recited the
berachah, then the reading for the second Yisrael begins at the
beginning of the sidrah. The first Yisrael waits, and is called again for
the next aliyah, and afterwards another Yisrael is called.
24

A minor (less than thirteen years old) cannot be the reader and is not
called to be an oleh.

25

After completing Kerias haTorah, half-kaddish is said and the Seifer
Torah is raised [in this manner:] the one who raises it opens the Seifer
Torah so that three columns of writing are revealed. He then displays it
to his right and left to those in front and back of him, because it is a
mitzvah for everyone to see the writing. [At this time] Vezos haTorah
etc. is said. The Seifer Torah is [then] rolled up. It is a mitzvah that it be
rolled up so that the seam be centered between the two rolls [of the
Seifer Torah]. The [Torah] should be rolled until the nearest seam is
located in the middle [that is]; if the seam preceding the part read is
nearest, it should be rolled in that direction; and if the seam after the
part read is nearest, it should be rolled in that direction, because it is
best to minimize the rolling out of respect to the Seifer Torah.

26

Every reading of the Torah is followed by half-kaddish, except at
minchah of Shabbos and at minchah of a fast-day when we rely on the
kaddish that is said before Shemoneh Esrei.




27


On Mondays and Thursdays after the raising of the Torah the chazzan
says [the prayer:] Yehi ratzon etc. The congregation should listen and
respond: Amein. On days when Tachanun is omitted Yehi ratzon is not
said.

28

After this, the Seifer Torah is returned to the Aron Hakodesh [Holy Ark].
It is a mitzvah for every person before whom the Seifer Torah passes, as
well as the one who raised it and the one who rolled it up, to
accompany it to the Aron Hakodesh.

29

Where a Seifer Torah is unavailable one should read aloud from a
Chumash and the congregation listen, so that the [mitzvah] of keriah
not be forgotten.

30

A minyan that is praying and has no Seifer Torah to read, a Seifer Torah
may not be brought to them for the purpose of the keriah, even if they
incarcerated in prison. [This applies] even for Rosh Hashanah and Yom
Kippur. However, if preparations were made a day or two in advance
[to have] an ark or a box, where a place was set aside for the Seifer
Torah, [then] it is permitted [to bring the Seifer Torah]. For an esteemed
person who is ill it is permitted to bring it even if it is only for the
purpose of the keriah. Others maintain that for an esteemed person
even if he is not ill or for an ill person even if he is not an esteemed
person, it is permitted. The lenient opinion may be followed on the
Shabbos when Parshas Zachor or [the Shabbos] when Parshas Parah are
read, because some maintain that they (these two parshios) are
obligatory mideoraisa.




"
"1

If a Seifer Torah is found to be defective due to an error, if the error is a
serious one we are not permitted to read from it, and another Seifer
Torah must be taken out [of the ark] (see Chapter 79: 10). What
constitutes a serious error? For example, [if there is] one letter too
many, or one missing, or even if one letter is exchanged [with another]
and as a result the pronunciation is changed, for example [if the word]
tomim (twins) [is written with an added aleph, and would now be read]
te'omim, or the word migresheihen [with a nun at the end] [would be
written] migresheihem [ending in a mem], even though the meaning of
the word is the same, [i. e., their ground], nevertheless, since the
pronunciation is not the same, it is considered a serious error. Likewise,
if the error is such that the word could be pronounced, as though it
were written correctly, but it was written in a way that changes its
meaning; for instance, in the [weekly] portion Terumah [in the phrase]
amah vacheitzi rochbo, the word rochbo (with a vav at the end) was
instead written rochbah (with a hei at the end) although (even with the
erroneous spelling) the beis can be pronounced with a cholam -o(vocalized rochbo) nevertheless, since, as it is written [now] it is an error,
because the meaning of the word is changed, it is also considered a
serious mistake. And if the error is of the kind that it changes neither
the pronunciation nor the meaning [of the word], for example, if
instead of the correct [spelling] of the word avosam with a vav after the
beis, it is found [written] without a vav, or vice versa, or, if instead of
the correct [spelling of a word] with an auxiliary yud [to indicate the
plural], as for instance, if the word avoseichem is found written without
a yud, or vice versa, or any similar case, we do not take out another





Seifer Torah, (because [nowadays] our Sifrei Torah are not so exact that
we can say [with certainty] that the other one will be more fit.) But if a
Yud is missing that is part of the root [of the word], if, for instance, [in
the verse] mah lach Hagar al tire'i, [what's the matter Hagar? Do not
fear]. the word (tire'i) [would be written] without a yud after the tav, or
if [in the verse] al tira Avraham [do not fear, Avraham] the word tira
would be written [without a Yud], then another Seifer Torah should be
taken out.
2

If a single word is divided so that it looks like two [separate words], or
if two words are so close to each other that they look like one [word],
or if there is one extra word, whether it is an unrelated word that is
entirely out of place or a word that is duplicated, or if there is a change
in the form of [the division of ] sections, for example, there is a pesuchah
[open space at the end of a line of writing] instead of a sesumah
[enclosed space in a written line], or a sesumah instead of a pesuchah, or
there is a division of the sections where it is unnecessary, or where it was
necessary to divide sections and this was not done. All these mistakes
constitute serious defects and another Seifer Torah must be taken out.

3

If one letter is attached to another; if it seems that they were attached
after the Seifer Torah was written, it may be used as long as the shape of
the letter is unchanged. But if it seems as though [the letters] were
attached while it was written, then there are the following distinctions;
if the letters were attached before [one of ] the letters was finished, for
instance, if a long nun (a final nun) is joined in the center with the foot
of the letter tav, [ ] or in similar cases, the Scroll is invalid. However,
on weekdays you may scrape that spot to separate them. But if the





letters are attached at the end [ ], the Seifer Torah may be used and it is
not necessary to take out another Seifer Torah.
4

If a letter has lost its shape, whether this happened when it was first
written, or it occurred afterwards because of a hole, the Seifer Torah is
invalid. But if the hole is in the middle of the letter, or outside of it,
and the letter has its correct shape but it is not completely surrounded
by parchment, and it is evident that the hole was made after [the letter]
was written, the Seifer Torah may be used, because at the time [the
letter] was written it was surrounded by parchment. If the ink of a letter
has chipped off so that it is not as black as it should be, the Seifer Torah
is invalid.

5

If there is any doubt regarding a letter, whether or not it has the correct
shape; it should be shown to a child who is neither exceptionally smart
nor a fool, (that is, one who does not understand the subject matter,
but knows and understands the letters). If he reads it correctly, the
Seifer Torah may be used; otherwise, it is invalid. If [it was shown to]
several children and they disagree, we rule according to the majority. It
is only when we are in doubt that we rely on [the view of ] a child, for
in that case it is only a means for establishing the facts, but if we see
[plainly] that the letter is not as it should be, or if the yud-shaped
appendages of the alef are disconnected [from the main portion of the
letter], or the yud-shaped appendages of the ayin and the shin or the
foot of the letter tav etc. [are disconnected,

] the Seifer Torah is pasul

(invalid) even when a child reads them [correctly], because we see with
our eyes that the letter is not as it should be.




6


When [the letter] is shown to a child it is not necessary to cover the
letters that follow, but it is the custom to cover the letters that come
before it. If a letter was severed by a hole and a part of [the letter] is left
also below the hole, and we are in doubt if the size of the letter above
the hole is enough to satisfy the minimum requirement, it is necessary
to cover the part below the hole because the child will [naturally]
connect [the parts], while in reality they are not connected. Likewise, if
the ink has chipped off from part of a letter and some trace is left, it
must be covered, so that the child will not combine it [with the good
part of the letter].

7

In case a defect is found for which another Seifer Torah must be taken
out; if the defect is discovered between the calling up of two people,
another Seifer Torah is taken out, and the reading is resumed from
where it was interrupted, and we continue the calling of the required
number of men. Those men who were already called to the defective
Seifer Torah are counted in the required number. However, if this occurs
on Shabbos, if it is possible to call seven men to the second Seifer Torah,
this should be done, (in deference to the opinion of the Gaonim who
maintain that [the portion] read in the defective Seifer Torah does not
count,) because it is the custom anyhow to call more than the required
seven men.

8

If the defect is discovered while the reading is in progress, then there are
different opinions and customs [as to what course to follow,] and every
community should follow its custom. In a community that has no set
custom, it seems to me that they should do as stated in the Shulchan
Aruch, [namely,] not to say [the concluding] berachah over the defective





Seifer Torah. Rather [the reading] should be stopped immediately, and
another Seifer Torah should be taken out and [the reading] should begin
from where it was interrupted. If [the reading] was interrupted in the
middle of a verse, it seems to me, [that the reading in the second Seifer
Torah] should begin from the beginning of that verse and end at the
conclusion of the portion [for the person called]. (It would seem that
they should read at least three verses for him from the correct Seifer
Torah. If there are not three verses left before concluding the portion of
the week we should go back a few verses) and the concluding berachah
should be said. But the first berachah is not repeated, because there is
validity to the berachah that was recited over the defective Seifer Torah.
(Of course, if it is possible to call seven people to the correct Seifer
Torah this should be done, as outlined in the previous paragraph.) The
same rule applies even [in the case] where the reading has not begun at
all for the person who was called; [that is,] if the defect was discovered
immediately after the [first] berachah [was said]. Then also another
Seifer Torah is taken out and the first berachah is not repeated; and it
makes no difference [whether the defect was found] during the reading
of the last portion or any other portion, in this regard. If it occurred
during [the reading of ] maftir, see Ch. 78: 8.
9

If a defect is discovered in a Seifer Torah and there is no other Seifer
Torah available, we should complete the calling of the required number
of men [to the defective Seifer Torah] but they should not say the
berachos. (See Chapter 78: 8 and Chapter 79: 10).

10

Some authorities hold that if a defect is discovered in a Seifer Torah in
one chumash, it is permissible to read from [this Seifer] in another
chumash. For example, if the defect is in the Book of Bereishis, it is





permissible to read [from this Seifer] in the Book of Shemos, and say the
berachos. We may rely on this [opinion] in case of an emergency, [that
is], if it was impossible to correct [the defect] or [the defect] was
discovered on Shabbos or on Yom Tov. However, during the Minchah
service on Shabbos afternoon this [defective Seifer] should not be taken
out because this reading is not as essential, (as it was instituted merely
for the benefit of those who do not attend [services] at the synagogue
on Monday and Thursday.)
11

If the seam is torn between two sheets of the parchment, if the greater
part [of the parchment] remains sewn together, we may read from the
Seifer Torah, if not, we must take out another Seifer Torah. If no other
Seifer Torah is available, and the tear is in that Book of the chumash
from which we must read, we do not use it unless at least five stitches
remained, but if the tear is in another chumash, then we may read from
this Seifer Torah even only two stitches remained.

12

If is a bit of wax or fat dripped on a letter or on a word; if this was
discovered on a weekday, it should be removed, but on Shabbos or on
Yom Tov, if the [covered] letters are visible the Seifer Torah may be read,
as it is. But if the letters are so [heavily] covered that they are not visible
at all, if [these letters] are in a place where the reading does not occur,
the Seifer Torah may be used and the berachos may be said. But if [the
letters] are in a place where the reading does occur,—since it is
forbidden to read even one letter unless the writing is clearly visible—
therefore, if it is at all possible to remove the wax or the fat in an
indirect way, that is, if it is completely dry so that by folding the
parchment it would fall off, then this should be done; otherwise, the
Seifer Torah may not be used. When you remove the wax or the fat on a





weekday, and [the substance] is covering the Divine Name, care should
be taken that, God forbid, none of the letters are erased, rather, the
reverse side of the parchment should be warmed so that the wax or the
fat comes off by itself.
"
"1

Ashrei and Tehillah leDavid (A Psalm of Praise by David) are said and
you should concentrate well when reciting it, especially when reciting
the verse, Posei'ach es yadecha … [You open Your hand] (as was
mentioned in Ch. 14: 2 above).

2

After Ashrei, Lamenatzei'ach is said. This Psalm is omitted on the
following days; Rosh Chodesh, Chanukah, Purim; the same rule applies
in a leap year on the fourteenth and fifteenth days of Adar I, the day
before Pesach, the day before Yom Kippur, and on Tishah be'Av. Neither
it is said in the house of a mourner. On a day that Lamenatzei'ach is
omitted Eil erech apayim is also omitted.

3

We say the Kedushah that is included in Uva letziyon with the Targum
(Amaraic translation). You should be very careful to recite it with
concentration; and the Targum should be said quietly. (In a mourner's
house the verse Va'ani zos berisi is omitted).

4

It is forbidden to leave the synagogue before reciting this Kedushah.

5

You should glorify this [Kedushah] by saying it together with the
congregation; and therefore, if you arrive at the synagogue when the
congregation is reciting it, you should say it with them even before you





say your prayers. You may recite this [Kedushah] even before saying the
two verses [preceding it] that is, Uva letziyon … and Va'ani zos berisi …
and after [you conclude the Kedushah], you say these two verses; and
certainly you may skip Ashrei and Lamenatzei'ach in order to say this
Kedushah together with the congregation, and afterwards say what you
have skipped.
6

Then we say Aleinu leshabei'ach … (It is our obligation to praise …)
and this should be said with great reverence. Joshua instituted [this
prayer] when he conquered Jericho. Then we say the Psalm for that day
as well as other Psalms, every community, according to its custom.

7

Upon leaving the synagogue you recite the verse Hashem nacheini
(Hashem, lead me). You should bow towards the Aron Hakodesh like a
pupil taking leave from his master. When leaving the synagogue, you
should not leave with your back toward the Aron Hakodesh, but you
should walk out sideways, and do the same when you descend from the
reading lectern.

8

When leaving the synagogue, it is forbidden to run or walk with long
strides, because this would make it appear as if your stay in the
synagogue was like a burden to you. This only applies when you leave
to go to work, but if you leave the synagogue to go to a Beis Midrash
(house of study) then it is considered a mitzvah if you rush.
"
"1

Many stories are told in the Midrashim indicating that because the son
said kaddish for his father or mother they were saved from [Heavenly]





judgment. It is, therefore, customary [for a mourner] to say kaddish, to
be called up to maftir, and to act as chazzan before the congregation,
especially on motza'ei shabbos (ending of Shabbos) which is the time
when the souls return to Geihinnom. The same holds true for every
evening, for then judgment is rendered with great severity. Concerning
the kaddish there are many divergent rules, in accordance with the
various [local] customs.
2

During the shivah, whether [the mourner] is a minor or an adult, a
resident or a visitor, he is entitled to say all the kaddishim, precluding
all other mourners. Even if a festival occurs during the shivah which,
cancels the rules of the shivah, or [if the festival occurs] after the shivah
which cancels the rules of the sheloshim, this does not nullify the laws of
kaddish. Likewise, relative to kaddish [we do not apply] [the principle]
that part of the day is considered as the whole day. Thus, even at
Minchah of the seventh day, the mourner has the right to say all the
kaddishim. The shivah and sheloshim are counted from the day of the
burial. Even though the mourner was not informed [of his loss]
immediately, and begins to observe the seven days of mourning
afterwards, yet, with regard to saying kaddish the rules of shivah do not
apply in his case. Similarly, if the death occurs on a festival, with regard
to the kaddish we count, from the day of the burial.

3

If there is also a yorzeit at the synagogue, then if the person observing
shivah is a minor who attends [services] throughout the shivah at the
synagogue, then the yorzeit may say one kaddish. If there are many
people observing yorzeit then each one may say one kaddish, even if
[because of that] the minor who is observing shivah is entirely excluded
[from saying kaddish]. If there is a mourner observing sheloshim he may





also say one kaddish. But if there are many observing sheloshim, then a
minor who is observing shivah is not entirely excluded because of them.
If [the mourner] is an adult who does not attend services [during
shivah], at the synagogue, even though he prays at his home with a
minyan, nevertheless, when he comes to the synagogue on Shabbos, he
is [entitled] to say all the kaddishim. If one who is observing yorzeit is
there, he is still entitled to say all the kaddishim, except for one kaddish
over which lots should be drawn [to determine who will say it]. But if
the shivah was interrupted either because of an intervening festival or
his father's death occurred on a festival, then the law regarding a minor
applies to him, since he may attend [services] at the synagogue daily.
4

A minor and an adult who are observing shivah; have equal rights
regarding the kaddish, when they come to the synagogue on Shabbos.
A person who is observing yorzeit, is barred by the adult [from saying
kaddish], and, therefore, the adult recites [in this case] one kaddish
more than the minor, that is, the kaddish which the minor would have
had to give to the yorzeit.

5

A person observing yorzeit and one observing sheloshim have preference
over other mourners who are in their year of mourning. Even so, they
should also be given some of the kaddishim. It is proper to follow the
practice that the kaddish derabbonon and also the kaddish that is said
after Aleinu, should be assigned to the person observing yorzeit or
sheloshim, while the other kaddishim should be said by the other
mourners, if there are as many mourners as there are kaddishim.

6

[If there is in the synagogue] a person who is observing yorzeit and one
who is observing sheloshim, then if at all possible, the one who is





observing sheloshim should be given precedence, and the yorzeit should
say only one kaddish. If there are many observing yorzeit, every one of
them is entitled to one kaddish, even if [as a result] the person
observing sheloshim will be entirely prevented [from saying kaddish],
because the latter will have the opportunity to say it the next day, where
as if the yorzeit does not say it today, he will have missed his
opportunity.
7

If there are two mourners, with equal rights, they should draw lots, and
if one wins the right to recite the kaddish at the Ma'ariv service the
other is entitled accordingly, to say one kaddish at the Shacharis service
without drawing lots, and for the third kaddish they should [again]
draw lots. Likewise, if there are many [mourners], lots should also be
drawn, and the one who wins does not participate in any subsequent
lots until all the [mourners] have said [one kaddish].

8

A resident mourner takes precedence over a visitor (unless the visitor is
observing shivah). Regarding a resident and a visitor who are observing
yorzeit the visitor has no rights whatsoever. If there is a resident
observing sheloshim, or a resident observing the year of mourning, and
there is a visitor observing yorzeit, the visitor is entitled to one kaddish.
And if there is a resident observing yorzeit and another resident
observing sheloshim, and a visitor observing yorzeit, the visitor also says
one kaddish, and the resident observing yorzeit cannot say to the visitor
""I have precedence,"" for [the visitor] can answer: ""I did not take this
kaddish from you, but from the one observing sheloshim."" The resident
observing yorzeit says the first kaddish, and the visitor-yorzeit the
second kaddish, and the one observing sheloshim the third kaddish.




9


A visitor observing sheloshim and a resident observing the year of
mourning, are in the same category.

10

If there is a resident observing yorzeit and a visitor in his sheloshim, the
resident says the first and second kaddish, and the visitor the third one.

11

A visitor observing the year of mourning is entitled to one kaddish
among the residents in mourning who, are also observing the year of
mourning.

12

A resident in this regard is considered, anyone with a permanent
residence in the community even though he pays no taxes [to the
kehillah,] or he pays taxes [to the kehillah] even though he does not
reside there. If someone comes from a different community to say
kaddish after his father or mother who resided in the community; even
though they were residents nevertheless, since this son does not reside
there nor pays taxes, he is not considered a resident. A resident who
employs a teacher or a servant, if they are single, they are considered
residents [of the community]; but if they have wives who live elsewhere,
then they are considered visitors. A student in a yeshivah, and a teacher
who is employed to teach the children of many residents, even though
their wives live elsewhere, have the status of community residents. If a
resident raises an orphan in his house, even for compensation, if [this
orphan] has neither father nor mother, he [the orphan] is considered a
resident; but if the orphan has either a father or a mother elsewhere,
even if he is being raised as an act of charity, [the orphan] has the status
of visitor.




13


One who prays at a synagogue or at a [certain] Beis Hamidrash,
regularly, who now comes to say kaddish at another synagogue, the
mourners there may prevent him [from saying it], even if he is in his
shivah period. His status is less than that of a visitor, because a visitor
has no other place to pray and say kaddish, while this person has.

14

A mourner who is capable and worthy to act as chazzan, should do so
since this is of greater benefit than saying the mourner's kaddish, which
was originally instituted only for minors. A mourner who is unable to
lead the entire service, should begin from Ashrei and Uva letziyon etc.
The mourner who is first in line for saying kaddish, for example, one in
his shivah or sheloshim, is also first in line with respect to acting as the
chazzan. It is customary that a mourner does not lead the service on
Shabbos and on Yom Tov. However, if before becoming a mourner he
was accustomed to lead the service on Shabbos and Yom Tov, he may
do so also during the mourning period. (Sha'arei Teshuvah quoting
Teshuvas Meir; Nesivim Ch. 80, see Ch. 128: 8 below).

15

If two mourners have equal rights with regard to Kaddish, and both of
them are capable of acting as chazzan and are equally acceptable to the
congregation, they should draw lots [to determine] which one should
lead in prayer until Ashrei and Uva letzion, and the second one should
lead from Ashrei and Uva letziyon [to the conclusion of the service]. If
one mourner is unable to lead the prayers or he is unacceptable to the
congregation and the other mourner leads the prayers, the one who
leads the prayers does not forfeit his rights to the kaddishim.
Nevertheless, he ought to relinquish his rights and leave the kaddish to





the one who did not lead in prayer, certainly [he should relinquish his
rights] when [the other mourners] are minors.
16

A person who is in mourning for both his father and his mother, is not
entitled to any more rights with regard to leading in prayer or the
kaddish than any other mourner, because one remembrance suffices for
both parents.

17

It is customary to say kaddish for no more than eleven months, in order
not to make the parents appear as grave sinners, for grave sinners are
sentenced for a period of twelve months. For example, if the death
occurred on the 10th of Shevat, the [mourner] stops saying [kaddish]
on the 9th of Teiveis. On the 10th of Teiveis he should not say
[kaddish], since this is the first day of the twelfth month [and we have a
rule] that one day of a month counts as an entire month, it will appear
that he said it for twelve months. The Kaddish period of eleven months
is counted from the day of the burial and not from the day of death.
[Consequently], if the burial took place on the 11th of Shevat, the
mourner stops saying kaddish on the 10th of Teiveis, because the
Heavenly judgment begins only after burial. If it was a leap year he
stops saying kaddish on the 9th (or 10th) of Kisleiv. On the day the
mourner stops saying Kaddish, he is entitled to say all the kaddishim,
but a yorzeit [who is present] is entitled to one kaddish, and so is a
person in his sheloshim. If there are a number of people observing
yorzeit, or mourners in their sheloshim, he is completely debarred
because of them. If [a mourner] knows that his father or mother were
grave sinners, of the category of those who are judged for twelve
months, it is fitting and obligatory that he says kaddish for twelve
months.




18


If there are many mourners, may the Merciful One save us, then, in
order to avoid quarrels and friction, it is customary in many
communities for two or three mourners to say kaddish together.

19

If there is no one in the synagogue mourning the loss of a father or a
mother then the [mourner's] kaddish should be recited by anyone who
has neither father or mother. This Kaddish is said for the sake of all the
departed in Israel. In some communities it is the custom for relatives to
say the kaddish for members of their family if there are no mourners for
fathers or mothers. Even when there are mourners for fathers or
mothers, if someone wishes to say the kaddish for a grandfather or a
grandmother who died without leaving any sons, or for his son or
daughter who died without leaving any sons, the other [mourners]
should allow him to say one kaddish, after each of them have said their
kaddish. There are communities that follow the custom that relatives
may say kaddish [for any family member] even when there are
mourners for fathers and mothers present, but they reach a
compromise, that they do not say as many kaddishim as those who
mourn their father or mother. In this matter we follow the prevailing
custom provided the custom is firmly established in that community.

20

A daughter should not say kaddish at the synagogue. However, some
authorities are of the opinion, that if a minyan assembles at her home in
order that she may say the kaddish there, they may do so. But other
authorities hold that even this is not permitted.

21

If a person observes yorzeit and is unable to say kaddish, for example,
he is traveling, or there were not enough kaddishim for everyone, then





he may say kaddish at the Maariv service following the yorzeit.
22

Even though the saying of kaddish and prayers are helpful to [the souls
of ] the parents, yet they are not the main thing. The most important
thing is that the children walk in the path of righteousness, because
with that they gain Heavenly favor for their parents. Thus it is written
in the holy Zohar: (at the end of the portion Bechukosai) ""A son honors
his father."" This statement is similar to the Divine command ""Honor
your father and your mother,"" which teaches [that a son must provide
his parents] with food and drink. All this he must do while they are
alive. but after their death you might think he is exempt, this is not so.
Even after their death it is his duty to honor them even more, for it is
written, ""Honor your father;"" and if the son walks in the path of evil,
he surely shows contempt for his father, and disgraces him. But if the
son walks in the path of righteousness and acts properly, he certainly
honors his father thereby; he honors him in this world in the [eyes] of
men, and confers glory on him in the other world in the presence of the
Holy One, blessed is He. And the Holy One, blessed is He, has mercy
on him and seats him on His Throne of Honor … (end of Zohar text).
A person should, therefore, instruct his children to observe one certain
mitzvah [with particular care]. If they fulfill [this mitzvah] it counts for
more than saying the kaddish. This is also a good course [to follow] for
a person who has no sons, only daughters.
"
"1

After prayers, time should be set aside for the study of Torah. It is
necessary that this study period be on a regular basis so that you will
not skip them even if it means earning big profits. If you must attend





to a very important matter, you should first study at least one [Torah]
verse or one law, and then take care of your affairs, and then your daily
study period. Some communities have established Torah study groups
that meet immediately after prayers; and every God fearing man should
join them.
2

Every Jewish man must study the Torah, no matter whether he is poor
or rich, whether he is healthy or suffering pain, whether he is young or
very old. Even a beggar who goes from door to door must set aside a
certain time for Torah study during the day and night, as it is written:
""And you shall meditate in it day and night."" If a person lacks the
knowledge to study Torah or it is impossible for him [to study] because
he is burdened with too many concerns, then he should support others
who do engage in Torah study, and it will be considered as though he
himself had studied, as our Rabbis of blessed memory, explained the
verse: ""Rejoice Zevulun in your going out and Yissachar in your tents.""
Zevulun and Yissachar entered into a partnership; Zevulun engaged in
business and supported Yissachar, so that he would be free to be
engrossed in the study of Torah. Because of this, the Torah mentions
Zevulun before Yissachar, since the Torah learning of Yissachar was
made possible through the support of Zevulun. And so we find in the
Mishnah: ""Shimon the brother of Azaryah said …,"" Shimon is
described as the brother of Azaryah, because Azaryah was engaged in
business and provided the needs of his brother Shimon, who was
engrossed in Torah study. They made an agreement between
themselves, that Azaryah would have a share in Shimon's reward for
[Torah] study. Even so, every person should do his utmost to study
Torah, even just a little, every day and every night.




3


A person who cannot study Torah full time, but sets aside regular
periods for Torah study, should use these set hours to study the halachos
(laws) that occur frequently, and which every Jew must know. He
should also study Agados and Midrashim and books of ethics which are
based on sacred sources such as, the Midrashim of the Rabbis of blessed
memory. [These studies] help man restrain his evil impulses. Fortunate
is the man who has made a fixed and unbending resolution to study the
book Chok Leyisrael on a daily basis. And the more a person studies the
more blessing he receives from Heaven.

4

When you are studying [Torah] and you need to go out, you should
not leave your book open, because this causes you to forget what you
learned. (Sifsei Kohein Yoreh Deiah 277)

5

A person should be careful in whatever he studies, to pronounce the
words with his lips and to make it audible to his ears, for it is written,
""This book of the Torah shall not leave your mouth and you shall
meditate on it…"" And a person who pronounces the words even
though he does not understand [their meaning], fulfills the mitzvah of
""And you shall study them."" Therefore, every unlearned person should
say the berachah over Torah every morning before reciting the verses
[Yevarechecha etc.], and also when he is called up to the Seifer Torah.
Anyone who engages in Torah study but is unable to understand it for
lack of knowledge, will merit to understand it in the World to Come.

1


It is a positive commandment, incumbent upon every Jewish man to
write a Seifer Torah for himself, for it is written, ""And now write for
yourselves this song;"" and via oral tradition, our Rabbis of blessed
memory explained, that everyone should write the entire Torah which
contains this song [of Moses]. Even a person who inherits a Seifer Torah
from his father, is commanded to write one for himself. If someone
hires a soifer (scribe) to write a Seifer Torah for him, or if he buys it and
finds that it is defective, and corrects it, this is considered as though he
had written it. It is forbidden to sell a Seifer Torah, but in a case of great
need you should consult a competent Rabbi.

2

It is also a mitzvah for every person to buy other sacred books for
learning purposes, such as Tenach (Bible), the Mishnah, the Talmud,
and codes of law, to study from them and to lend them to others. If a
person does not have the means to buy both a Seifer Torah and other
books for study, then the books for study have preference. Our Rabbis
of blessed memory stated: [""It is written], ""And his righteousness
endures forever,"" this refers to the person who writes (or buys) [sacred]
books and lends them to others.""

3

A person must have great respect for a Seifer Torah. It is his duty to
assign a special place for it and to treat this place with honor, and to
hold it in utmost reverence. He must not spit in front of the Seifer
Torah, and he should not hold a Seifer Torah without its cover [or
mantle]. When you see a Seifer Torah being carried, you must rise [and
remain standing] until the Seifer Torah is brought to its place, or until it
is out of sight. In the synagogue, when the Seifer Torah is taken out or
carried [to the Ark], it is a mitzvah for all those before whom it passes





to accompany it to its destination. Also the person who lifted [the Seifer
Torah], and the one who rolled it up should accompany it.
4

Even sacred books [must be treated respectfully]. If they are on a bench,
it is forbidden to sit on this bench, unless the books are placed on
something that is at least one tefach in height. And certainly it is
forbidden to place religious books on the floor. You should not place a
religious book on your knees and rest your elbows on it. In an
emergency situation, it is permitted to sit on a chest which contains
sacred books, but if it contains a Seifer Torah, it is forbidden to do so.
You are allowed to place a Chumash (Pentateuch) on top of the Books
of Nevi'im (The Prophets) and Kesuvim (The Writings), and the Books
of Kesuvim on top of Nevi'im, or, [conversely,] Nevi'im on top of
Kesuvim. But you are not permitted to place Nevi'im or Kesuvim on top
of Chumashim.

5

A Seifer Torah that became worn out must be stored away [with
dignity]. The same must be done with other religious books, sacred
writings, and sacred articles. It is forbidden to burn them.

6

Sacred writings should not be thrown around even if they are only
Books of law or Agadah. They may not be placed upside down; if you
find them wrong side up, you must place them in the proper position.

7

It is forbidden to urinate in the presence of religious books. In an
emergency situation, they should be placed at least ten tefachim above
the ground.

8

It is forbidden to make a covering or a mantle for any sacred article out
of material that was used for common purposes. But, after the fact, if it





has already been made, it may be used. But, material that was used for
purposes of idolatry, is forbidden, even if it was already made.
9

It is forbidden to use a religious book for your personal benefit, for
example, to stand it up as a screen against the sun, or, so that someone
else does not see what you are doing; but if the sun shines on the book
you are studying you may use another book as a screen, because you are
not using it for your enjoyment. Likewise, to place a book underneath
the book you are studying in order to raise it for easier studying, may
be permitted. But it is not permitted to place one book inside another,
so that you should not have to look later for the place you are studying.
You should not draw lines on note paper [in order to write a
commentary on the Torah] [by placing the paper] on the book, because
the note paper is not sacred until [something sacred] is written on it.
Neither are you allowed to put note paper or something similar into a
book for safekeeping.

10

Whoever destroys sacred writings violates the negative commandment,
""Do not act in this manner to Hashem your God."" We must protest
against those bookbinders who paste sacred writings in the bookcovers.
You also must be very careful when you give old, sacred books to a nonJewish bookbinder. You should remove the old covers and hide them so
that the bookbinder will not install them in secular books.

11

It is forbidden to buy a Seifer Torah, tefillin, and mezuzos from a nonJew for more than their true value, in order not to encourage them to
steal and rob them. However, at their actual value, it is our duty to buy
them. Even when the writing is defective and therefore must be stored
away these sacred writings must be redeemed from non-Jewish hands. If





the non-Jew demands an exorbitant price, we must bargain with him
and persuade him to sell at the proper price. If the [non-Jew] persists,
we should let him keep [the objects]. We should not ask the non-Jew to
sell them at a price that is too low, lest he become angry and throw
them away and become totally ruined.
12

If a Seifer Torah falls out of someone's hand, even if it is [covered] by its
mantle, he must fast, and it is the custom that those who see it [fall]
also fast.

13

It is forbidden to write a Biblical verse without lines. (see Magein
Avraham Ch. 32: 7) Some authorities hold that it is forbidden to write
secular words in the Ashuris lettering, in which the Seifer Torah is
written.
"
"1

People have varying character traits. Some people are angry by nature,
forever bursting with rage, then there are others who are tranquil who
never become angry, or who become angry [only] once in many years.
[You will find] a man who is extremely haughty, and another who is
extremely humble. Some are lustful, their souls never satisfied with
their unbridled cravings, others possess a very pure heart, and have no
desire even for little things which are required for physical well-being.
Some people have a voracious hunger for wealth and are not satisfied
with all the money in the world, as it is written, ""The person who loves
money will not be satisfied with money."" Others have very modest
desires, and are satisfied with little which does not even fill their needs,
and [yet] make no effort to earn a livelihood. Some will afflict





themselves with hunger and accumulate money this way, and [the little]
they eat of their own [food] causes them distress. Others spend all their
money [wastefully.] It is the same with all other character traits and
concepts, as for example, the cheerful and the gloomy, the miser and
the noble hearted, the cruel and the compassionate, the gentle and the
hard-hearted and so on.
2

The good and right path to follow is to accustom yourself to walk the
middle course. You should desire only those things which are required
for your physical well being, and without which it is impossible to live,
as it is written, ""The righteous person eats to satisfy his soul."" You
should be absorbed in your business affairs only to the extent that it
enables you to acquire things that you need for your daily life, as it is
written, ""Better is the little of the righteous."" Do not be overly tightfisted, nor spend your money too freely, but rather give charity
according to your ability and lend money wisely to whom ever needs it.
Do not be too jubilant and jolly, nor too sad and gloomy. But be happy
at all times, be contented and show a friendly face. And so too with
most other character traits, anyone who follows the middle course is
called a wise man.

3

Conceit is a very bad character trait and it is forbidden to act
[haughtily] even to the slightest degree, but accustom yourself to be
humble in spirit, as our Sages of blessed memory have decreed, ""Be
exceedingly humble in spirit."" And how can you accustom yourself to
be modest and humble? All your words should be spoken gently, hold
your head down, your eyes should look downward, but your heart
upward, and in your eyes, consider all men to be greater than you are.
If he is a greater Torah scholar than you, then it is your duty to honor





him. Likewise, if he is richer than you, you must also honor him, as we
read [in the Talmud] ""Rebbi was wont to honor the rich."" Think of it
this way: ""Since Hashem, praised be He, gave him riches he is evidently
worthy of it."" If he ranks lower than you in wisdom or riches, consider
that he is more righteous than you; because if he commits a sin it is
considered an unintentional or accidental sin, whereas, when you
commit a sin it is considered an intentional sin. If you keep this in
mind at all times, you will never be arrogant and all will be well with
you.
4

Anger is also a very evil trait, and it should be avoided it at all costs.
You should train yourself not to become angry even if you have good
reason to be angry. And when it is necessary to impress your authority
on your children and your household, you may pretend to be angry in
order to admonish them, while retaining your composure inwardly.
[The Talmud relates] ""Eliyahu said to Rabbi Yehudah, the brother of
Rav Salla, the Pious: ""Do not become angry, and you will not sin,"" (do
not become angry, because anger will induce you to sin), ""Do not
become intoxicated, and you will not sin."" Our Rabbis of blessed
memory said furthermore, ""If anyone becomes angry it is considered as
though he worships idols, and the torments of Gehinnom will be
inflicted on him as it is written, ""Therefore, remove anger from your
heart and put away evil from your body."" The word ""evil"" connotes
Gehinnom as it is written: ""Indeed, even the wicked for the day of
evil."" The life of angry men is no life. Therefore, [our Sages] ordained
that a man should distance himself from anger to the point that he can
conduct himself with utter disregard even for things that evoke
[justifiable] anger. This is the proper path [to follow] and it is the way
of the righteous, [as stated in the Talmud] ""They suffer insults but do





not insult, they listen to abuse heaped on them but do not answer, they
are motivated by love in whatever they do, and they rejoice [even when]
suffering pain."" Concerning them, the Biblical verse says: ""But those
who love Him are as the sun when it comes out in its might.""
5

Always cultivate the virtue of silence, and engage in conversation only
on matters pertaining to Torah study, or on matters concerning your
personal needs; and even when [discussing] your personal needs you
should not talk too much about them. Our Rabbis of blessed memory
have already said, ""Whoever talks excessively causes sin"" and they said
[in the same vein], ""I have found nothing better for a person than
silence."" Rava said: ""What is the meaning of the verse, ""Death and life
are controlled by the tongue."" ""He who seeks life [can achieve it]
through his tongue, he who seeks death, [can achieve it] through his
tongue.""

6

You must neither be a jestor or a fool, neither should you be glum and
melancholy, rather you should be happy. Thus said [our Rabbis,] of
blessed memory, ""Jesting and frivolity lead a man to immorality."" You
should also avoid greediness, eagerly rushing after wealth. Be not
depressed, nor idle from work, but be benevolent in your outlook.
Hold your business affairs to a minimum and be occupied with the
study of Torah. Rejoice with your small share [of worldly goods]. Thus
said [our Sages] of blessed memory, ""Envy, lust and desire for glory
remove a man from the world."" So it is necessary that you stay away
from these [bad traits].

7

Perhaps a person might say: ""Since envy, lust and glory and the like, are
bad character traits that remove a man from the world, I will





completely abstain from them, and keep away from them entirely,"" to
the point that he will not eat meat, nor drink wine, nor marry a
woman, nor live in a comfortable dwelling, nor wear decent clothes,
but he will put on a sackcloth, or something similar; this too is a bad
way of life, and it is forbidden to follow it. Anyone who follows this
life-style is called a sinner. For in regard to the nazir it is written, ""To
atone for him who sinned by the dead,"" and [our Rabbis] of blessed
memory said, ""If a nazir who abstained only from drinking wine, needs
an atonement, a person who abstains from everything, how much more
so does he need [an atonement]."" Therefore, our Rabbis of blessed
memory ordained that you should abstain only from those things
which the Torah prohibits, but do not prohibit to yourself, things
which are permitted by means of vows and oaths. Thus said our Sages
of blessed memory, ""Is not what the Torah forbids enough for you that
you have to prohibit to yourself things which are permissible?"" And our
Rabbis of blessed memory have forbidden us to inflict pain on ourselves
with more fasting than is required. Concerning all these and similar
matters, King Solomon, peace be upon him, said, ""Do not be
excessively righteous, nor overly wise, why destroy yourself."" And he
said [in the same vein], ""Measure well the path of your foot then you
will stay on a straight course.""
8

We have mentioned before (Chapter 1: 3) the saying of Rabbi Yehudah
ben Teima, ""Be bold as a leopard…"" [which teaches] not to be ashamed
before people who deride you when you worship the Creator, blessed is
He. Nevertheless, you should not answer them rudely, so that you will
not acquire the habit of being impertinent even in situations not
involved with the worship of God, blessed be His Name.




9


Neither should you quarrel for [the right to perform] a mitzvah, such as
to lead the congregation in prayer, or to be called up to the Torah, or
the like. Just as we find it with the Show-bread, that although it was a
mitzvah to eat of it, yet, we are told, ""The modest used to give up their
share while the gluttons used to grab and devour it.""

10

It is human nature for man's actions to be influenced by his friends,
colleagues and townspeople. Therefore, you should associate yourself
with the righteous, and be in the company of wise men constantly, in
order to learn from their deeds. Keep away from evil men who walk in
darkness, in order not to learn from their behavior. King Solomon,
peace be upon him, said, ""Whoever walks with wise men will become
wise, but the companion of fools will come to ruin."" And it is written
[in the same vein], ""Fortunate is the man…"" And if someone lives in a
town whose customs are depraved and whose inhabitants do not walk
on the right path, he should move to a city whose inhabitants are
righteous and lead decent lives.

11

It is a positive commandment to associate with Torah scholars so that
we may learn from their deeds, as it is said, ""And cling to Him."" Is it
possible for man to cling to the Divine Presence? Rather our Rabbis of
blessed memory explain: ""Cling to Torah scholars."" Therefore, a man
should make a serious effort to marry the daughter of a Torah scholar,
and give his daughter in marriage to a Torah scholar, to eat and drink
with Torah scholars, and do business with a Torah scholar, and to join
hands with them in every possible form of association, for it is written,
""And cling to Him."" And thus mandated our Rabbis of blessed





memory, and they said: ""Sit in the dust of their feet and drink their
words thirstily.""
12

It is incumbent upon every Jew to love every fellow Jew as he loves
himself, as it is said: ""Love your neighbor as [you love] yourself.""
Therefore, you should relate [his] virtues and treat his property with
[the same] concern as you have for your own property, or for your own
honor. The person who glorifies himself in his neighbor's shame, even
though his neighbor is not present and the humiliation has not reached
him, and even if he has not actually insulted him, but only compared
his own good deeds and his own wisdom with the good deeds or
wisdom of his neighbor, so that from his statement he will be rated an
honorable man and his neighbor as a despicable person, [this person]
has no share in the World to Come unless he repents with perfect
repentance.

13

Anyone who hates a fellow-Jew in his heart, transgresses a negative
commandment, as it is said: ""Do not hate your brother in your heart.""
(See Chapter 189: 5) If anyone has sinned against you, you should not
hate him inwardly, and keep quiet about it, as it is written concerning
the wicked, ""And Avshalom did not speak to Amnon either bad or
good because Avshalom hated Amnon,"" but it is your duty to let him
know [what you think of him] and to say to him, ""Why have you done
this to me, why have you sinned against me in this matter?"", for it is
said: ""You must admonish your neighbor."" If the offender regrets it and
asks you to forgive him, you should forgive him and not be harsh, for it
is said: ""And Avraham prayed to God."" In Avos de Rabbi Nasan (end of
Chapter 16) [it is stated] ""What is meant by 'hatred of people'?"" It
conveys this thought: ""A person should not think of saying ""I will love





the scholars but hate the students, I will love the students but hate the
unlearned."" Rather, you should love them all, but hate the heretics, and
those who mislead and entice people, [to abandon the Torah and follow
false doctrines], and also [hate] the informers. And thus David said,
""Behold, those who hate You Hashem, I hate, and with those who rise
up against You, I contend. With utmost hatred do I hate them, they
have come to be my enemies."" But didn't God say; ""Love your
neighbor as [you love] yourself, I am Hashem?"" For what reason?
Because I (God) have created him. And if he keeps the laws of your
people you must love him, if not, you should not love him.
14

A person is forbidden to pray for judgment from Heaven against his
fellow man who treated him wrongly. This applies only if [his
grievance] can be settled in an earthly court. Anyone who prays for
Divine punishment against his fellow man, will himself be punished
first. There are some authorities who hold that even if his case cannot
be settled in an earthly court, he is not permitted to pray for Divine
judgment against him, unless he first lets him know [that he intends to
do so].

15

If you see someone committing a sin or following a wrongful course, it
is a mitzvah to bring him back to the good path and make him aware
that he is acting sinfully by committing his wrongful deeds, for it is
said: ""You must admonish your neighbor."" And when you admonish
someone, whether it concerns his personal relationships, or something
that concerns his relationship with God, you should admonish him
privately speaking to him gently with soothing words, letting him know
that you are speaking to him only for his own good, to help him merit
the life of the World to Come. Anyone who has the opportunity to





protest [against a sinful act] and does not speak out in protest, will be
held responsible for that very sin, because he could have protested.
16

This applies only in a case when you [have reason to] believe that the
sinner will listen to you, but when you know [for sure] that he will not
pay attention to your words, then you are forbidden to admonish him.
For Rabbi Ila'a said in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Shimon,
""Just as it is a mitzvah for a person to say something that will be
heeded, so it is a mitzvah to refrain from saying something that will not
be heeded."" Rabbi Abba says, ""It is his duty"" [to refrain from saying
anything that will not be taken under consideration]. for it is said: ""Do
not admonish a scorner lest he hate you; reprove a wise man and he will
love you.""

17

It is forbidden to humiliate anyone either by word or by deed,
especially in public. And our Rabbis of blessed memory said, ""A person
who humiliates someone in public will have no share in the World to
Come."" Our Rabbis of blessed memory said furthermore, ""It is better
for a man to throw himself into a fiery furnace than to put his fellow
man to shame,"" for it is said: ""When she was being taken out [to be
executed] she sent word to her father-in-law, saying: ""By the man who
is the owner of these articles I am pregnant."" She did not say to him
openly [that it was of him that she conceived] she merely hinted,
[thinking] if he admits it, fine, if not, I will not expose him publicly.""
Therefore, you should be very careful not to humiliate anyone in
public, whether he is a minor or an adult, nor to call anyone by a name
of which he is ashamed, and do not relate in his presence anything of
which he is ashamed. And if anyone sinned against you and it is
necessary for you to admonish him [for it], do not humiliate him, for it





is said: ""Do not sin through him."" This law applies only to a case where
he [sinned] against his fellow man, but if he [sinned] against God, and
does not retract [and repent] when you admonish him privately, you
may disgrace him publicly, and publicize his transgression, and you may
revile him to his face, you may insult him and curse him until he
returns to the good [path], as all the prophets in Israel have done.
Regarding such a person [the law prohibiting] the making of
disparaging remarks does not apply for it is said: ""Do not speak
slightingly to one another,"" and the Rabbis of blessed memory explain,
that the word amiso [to your fellow man], applies to those who are of
one mind with you in their observance of the Torah and the mitzvos.
The Torah forbids you to abuse them verbally, but you are not
[prohibited from verbally abusing] those persons who violate [the
Torah] and do not repent [even] after they have been admonished
privately, and with gentle words.
18

If someone sinned against you, and you do not want to admonish him,
or even mention it to him at all, and you forgive him wholeheartedly,
and you do not hate him and do not admonish him; this is the practice
of the pious, for the Torah's only concern is to banish hatred.

19

You should be very careful [in the way you treat] orphans and widows,
to speak only kindly to them, to treat them respectfully, not to hurt
them even with words, because their souls are very depressed and their
spirits are low, even if they are wealthy. Even [regarding] the widow and
the orphans of a king, we are warned [in the Torah], for it is said: ""Do
not mistreat a widow or an orphan."" A covenant was made [with
widows and orphans] by Him Whose Word called the world into being,
that whenever they cry because of an injustice that was done to them,





their [cries] will be answered, for it is said: ""For if he cries out to Me I
will hear his cry."" This applies only where someone hurts them for his
own benefit. But if a teacher afflicts them in order to teach them Torah
or a trade, or to lead them on a straight path, this is permitted.
Nevertheless, [the teacher] should be careful to guide them gently and
with great compassion, for it is said: ""For God will plead their cause.""
[In all of these laws, it makes no difference] whether he is an orphan
from his father or an orphan from his mother. And for how long are
they considered orphans in this regard? Until they are able to take care
of all their needs by themselves as all other adults.
20

A person should be careful not to do anything which might cause
[people] to suspect that he committed a sin, (even though he is not
[actually] committing a sin), as we find that the kohein who removed
the coins from the chamber did not enter [the chamber] in a garment
that was fashioned in a way that something could be hidden in it, for a
person must answer for his actions to his fellow man as he must answer
to the Almighty, blessed is He, as it is said: ""You will be innocent before
God and Israel"" And it is also said: ""And find favor and good
understanding in the eyes of God and man.""

21

It is the practice of pious people, not to accept gifts, but to trust that
Hashem, will take care of their needs, as it is said, ""But he that hates
gifts will live.
"
"1

It is written, ""Do not be a talebearer among your people."" What
constitutes talebearing? It is carrying gossip and going from one to the





other saying, ""So and so said this…,"" ""I have heard such and such
about so and so."" Even if [the tale he tells] is true, and it brings no
disgrace to anyone it is, still, a violation of a negative commandment,
and it is a grave sin, which causes the death of Jewish people. Because
of this [the law against talebearing] is followed by: [the verse] ""Do not
stand by the blood of your neighbor."" Think about what happened in
the case of Do'eg the Edomite, who told Shaul, that Achimelech gave
David food and a sword. Even though the thing [he told] was true, and
it did not reflect dishonor on Achimelech, for he had not done
anything wrong, and even if Shaul himself had asked Achimelech he
would have told him what he had done, for he had no intention to sin
against Shaul. Despite this, the talebearing of Do'eg caused many
kohanim to be killed.
2

There is a much graver sin [than tale bearing] which is classified under
this prohibition and that is slander; which is, speaking of someone's
shame, even if it is true. But a person who spreads lies [about others] is
guilty of besmirching someone's name. A slanderer is a person who
says, ""So and so has done such and such; so and so were his parents;
such and such a thing I heard about him,"" and he relates shameful
things. Regarding such a person, Scripture states, ""May Hashem cut off
all smooth [talking] lips, the tongue that speaks haughty words."" A
person who accepts slanderous gossip is worse than the one who spreads
it. The heavenly decree against our forefathers, in the wilderness was
sealed, only because [they committed] the sin of slander.

3

To what length [must we go to avoid] slander? [For instance], if a man
asks someone, ""Where can I find fire?"" and he replies, ""[I'll tell you]
where you can find fire. In the house of so and so where there is plenty





of meat and fish, and they are always cooking [something]."" [Even that
is considered slander].
4

And there are [certain] statements which are milder nuances of slander.
For example, if someone says: ""Let's not talk about so and so; I do not
want to tell what happened and what transpired,"" or words to that
effect. Likewise, if you tell of someone's virtues in the presence of his
enemies, this constitutes a milder nuance of slander, for this will
prompt [his enemies] to tell derogatory things about him. Concerning
this King Solomon said, ""He that praises his friend with a loud voice
when rising early in the morning, it will be counted as a curse to him,""
for [proclaiming] his virtues will cause him harm. Also when a person
slanders in a jesting or jocular manner, as if he were not speaking out of
hatred, [he is guilty of a milder form of slander]. King Solomon
[referred to this] when he said in his wisdom, ""As a man who pretends
to play, and shoots firebrands, arrows, and death [so is this man who
deceives his neighbor] and says 'Look, I'm only joking."" Equally
[guilty] is a person who slanders with slyness, by pretending to speak
innocently, [as if he were] unaware that [what he says] is slander, and
when he is taken to task for it he says, ""I did not know that this was
slander"" or ""so and so [actually] did these things.""

5

If someone relates lashon hara, regardless whether in the presence or in
the absence of the other fellow, or if he tells things that would cause
damage to someone else, either to his person, or to his property, or even
if he only [intended] to annoy or to frighten him, that constitutes
lashon hara [slander]. But if these things had already been told in the
presence of three persons, it may be assumed that they have become
known, and if one of the three persons tells them once more [to other





people], it is not lashon hara, provided he did not [repeat it] with the
intention to spread the rumor and give it added publicity. What
procedure should a man follow to avoid falling into the trap of lashon
hara? If he is a Torah scholar he should engross himself in the study of
the Torah and if he is unlearned he should practice humility.
6

Rabbi Yirmiyah bar Abba said, ""[The following] four categories [of
people] will not see the Divine Presence [in the Hereafter]: scorners,
flatterers, liars, and those who speak lashon hara (slanderers). Scorners
[can be inferred], from the verse; 'He withdraws His hand from
scorners."" (Rashi explains [mashach yado] the Holy One, blessed is He,
pulls away His hand, [rejecting] the company of scorners). Flatterers,
[can be inferred], from the verse, ""A flatterer cannot come before
Him."" Liars [may be inferred], from the verse, ""He who tells lies will
have no place before My eyes."" Those who speak lashon hara, from the
verse, ""You are not a God Who desires wickedness, evil will not abide
with You."" (Rashi explains [that the phrase] ""Evil will not abide with
You"" refers to those who speak lashon hara, because it is written in this
psalm ""For there is no sincerity in their mouth…"") [The Gemara
concludes:] ""Since you are a righteous God, no evil can abide in Your
dwelling."" Our Rabbis of blessed memory said furthermore, ""All
ridicule is forbidden except for ridiculing idol worship, for it is written,
""And it happened at noon that Eliyahu mocked them…""

7

Whoever takes revenge on someone, violates a negative commandment,
for it is written, ""Do not take revenge."" And what constitutes
vengeance? Reuvein says to Shimon, ""Lend me your spade!"" [Shimon]
replies, ""No, I will not lend it to you."" The next day [Shimon] has to
borrow something and he says [to Reuvein]: ""Lend me your spade.""





[Reuvein] says: ""No, I will not lend it to you, just as you did not lend
me [yours] when I asked you for it."" This constitutes taking revenge,
and he [Reuvein] has violated a negative commandment. Rather when
[Shimon] comes to borrow something, he should give it to him
wholeheartedly and not pay him back for what he did to him. It is
becoming for a person to show forebearance in all mundane matters,
for in the eyes of understanding people, they are all nothing but vanity
and futility, and not worth taking revenge because of them. And thus
said King David, peace be upon him, ""If I have repaid my friends with
evil, I who released my unprovoked adversary. (For the prohibition
against uttering curses, see Chapter 6: 3).
8

If you [really] want to take revenge against your enemy, acquire more
good qualities and walk in the path of righteousness. In so doing you
will inevitably take vengeance against your enemy for he will be
distressed over your good qualities, and he will be grieved over your
good reputation. But if you [stoop to] do vile deeds, then your enemy
will rejoice over your disgrace and your shame, and he is the one who
takes revenge against you.

9

He who bears a grudge against a fellow Jew, violates a negative
commandment, for it is said, ""Don't bear a grudge against the children
of your people."" What constitutes bearing a grudge? [For example.]
Reuvein said to Shimon: ""Lend me that thing,"" and Shimon refused to
lend it. After a while Shimon came to borrow something from Reuvein,
and Reuvein said take it, ""I will lend it to you for I am not like you, I
will not repay you for what you did [to me]."" He who does so violates
the prohibition against bearing a grudge. He should blot it out of his
heart and think no more of it. And this is the proper frame of mind by





which society can survive and economic order between people [can be
maintained].
"
"1

Our Rabbis of blessed memory said, ""Upon which short verse are all
the principles of the Torah"" predicated? [It is] ""In all your ways
acknowledge Him."" It means that even in those things that you do for
your personal needs, you should acknowledge God, and do those things
for the sake of His Name, blessed is He. For example, eating, drinking,
walking, sitting, lying down, getting up, sexual intercourse, and talking
—all these physical needs should be done for the sake of serving your
Creator, or for the sake of [doing] something that will be conducive to
the service of Him.

2

How can you serve God by ""eating and drinking?"" Needless to say that
you may not eat or drink, things that are forbidden, God forbid. But
even regarding foods that are permitted, if you are thirsty and hungry,
and you eat and drink [just] to satisfy your desires, that is not a
praiseworthy [attitude]. But you should have in mind that you are
eating and drinking, to have strength to serve the Creator. Therefore,
you should not eat all that appeals to your palate, like a dog or a
donkey, but you should eat only things that are helpful and beneficial
to the health of your body. There are some very devout people who say
before partaking of food: ""I am about to eat and drink in order to be
healthy and strong to serve the Creator, blessed is His Name.""




3


How [can you serve God by] sitting, getting up and walking? Needless
to say, you should not sit in the company of scoffers, nor stand in the
way of sinners, nor walk in the counsel of the wicked. But even if you
sit in a meeting of honest men, and stand in the place of the righteous,
and walk in the counsel of the perfect, but you do this to satisfy your
own desires, to gratify your ambitions and cravings, that is not a
praisworthy [attitude]. You should do [these things] for the sake of
Heaven. Nevertheless, if you are unable to direct your thoughts to act
exclusively for the sake of Heaven, you should not abstain from doing
these things, for by doing good for ulterior motives you will eventually
do them for the sake of Heaven.

4

How [can you serve God by] lying down? Needless to say, at a time
when you are able to occupy yourself with [the study of ] Torah and
mitzvos, and you yield to [the urge] to sleep for your own gratification,
that this is not the proper thing to do. However when you are tired and
you must sleep in order to rest from your hard work, if you do so [just]
for pleasure, it is not a praiseworthy [attitude]. But you should have in
mind [that you are] giving sleep to your eyes and rest to your body in
order to be healthy, so that your mind is not distracted by sleepiness
when you study the Torah.

5

How can [sexual] intercourse be a service to God? Needless to say, that
you should not commit a sin, God forbid. Rather even when exercising
the conjugal rights that are spoken of in the Torah, if you do so for your
own gratification or to satisfy your lust, it would be reprehensible. And
even if you have in mind [during intercourse] to have sons to assist you
and take your place, it is not a praiseworthy [attitude]. Rather you





should have in mind to have children who will serve the Creator, or
have in mind to strengthen your body, and to fulfill the conjugal
mitzvah as a man who fulfills an obligation.
6

How [can you serve God] by talking? Needless to say, that you should
not engage in lashon hara, or talebearing and scoffing, or in talking
obscenities, God forbid. But even when telling anecdotes from [the life
of ] our Sages, you should have the intention to serve the Creator, or to
inspire [others] to serve Him.

7

Similarly, when you are engaged in business or in a trade [or profession]
to earn a livelihood, you should not aspire merely to accumulate
wealth, but pursue your work in order to support your family, to give
charity, and to raise your children to study the Torah. The general
principle [that should guide all your actions] is: It is the duty of every
person to consider his ways judiciously, and to weigh his deeds on the
scales of reason; and if he sees something that is conducive to the
service of the Creator, on high, he should do it, otherwise, he should
not do it. If you lead [your life according to] this rule, you will be
serving God all your days, even when sitting, getting up, walking, and
doing business, even when eating and drinking, yes, even when having
marital relations and performing all your bodily functions. With regard
to this way of thinking our Rabbis of blessed memory said: ""Let all
your deeds be for the sake of Heaven."" And in the same manner
Rabbeinu Hakodesh raised his fingers heavenward when he was dying,
and said: ""It is obvious and known to You that I derived no [personal]
benefit from them. [All I have done was] only for the sake of Heaven.
"

1


Because the maintenance of a complete and healthy body is a G-dly
path—since it is impossible to understand or apprehend any knowledge
of the Creator when one is sick—therefore you must keep away from
things that damage the body, and develop habits that improve the body
and heal it. Similarly, it is said: “You shall guard yourselves very well.”

2

The Creator, blessed be He and blessed be His name, created the
human being (and all living creatures) and gave them their natural
warmth. This is the person’s life-force; if the natural fire is extinguished,
life is gone. The maintenance of this warmth depends on the food that
one eats. As with a burning fire, where if it is not regularly supplied
with wood it will be entirely extinguished, so too with the human
being: if one does not eat, the internal fire will be extinguished, and he
will die. The food is ground between the teeth, mixed with saliva and
mashed up. From there it descends to the stomach, where it is further
broken down and is mixed with the stomach juices and bile, blended
and processed by the heat and by the juices, and digested. The choice
elements provide sustenance to all the limbs and sustains the person’s
life; the waste, which is the extraneous material, is ejected. Of this we
say in the Asher Yatzar blessing, “and [G-d] acts wondrously”—that Gd placed within the human being the natural ability to filter the good
elements from the food, with each limb drawing the substance that
befits it, and the waste being ejected. Were the waste to remain in the
body, it would putrefy and bring on sickness, may G-d preserve us.
Therefore, most aspects of bodily health and illness depend on the
digestion of food: if the food is digested well and with ease, then the
person is healthy; but if there are digestive problems, then the person
becomes weak and can end up in danger, G-d forbid.




3


Good digestion occurs when the food consumed is not excessive, and
when it is easily digestible. If you eat a lot and the stomach is full, then
digestion becomes difficult, for then the stomach is not able to expand
and contract, as it should by nature, to properly process the food. Just
as with a fire, where if it is over-heaped with wood it will not burn well,
so it is with the food in the stomach. Therefore, if you wish to guard
the health of your body, be careful not to eat more than an amount that
is average relative to your body’s constitution, neither too little nor to
full satiation. Most illnesses that come upon people are due only to bad
foods, or filling one’s belly and eating excessively even of good foods.
Thus said King Solomon in his wisdom: “One who watches his mouth
and his tongue guards his soul from troubles,” meaning: guard your
mouth from eating bad food and from being fully satisfied, and your
tongue from speaking except as needed. Likewise the wise man said:
One who eats a small amount of harmful foods is not harmed as much
as one who eats excessively of good food.

4

A youthful person has a strong digestive capacity, and therefore requires
food more often than a middle-aged person. And an elderly person,
whose digestive capacity is weak, must eat light foods, in small quantity
and of good quality, to invigorate his strength.

5

On hot days the digestive system is weakened by the heat, and therefore
you ought to eat less during on hot days than on cold ones. Expert
physicians have estimated that during the summer you should eat twothirds of what you eat during the winter.




6


It is a general rule of healthy practice that before eating, you should
engage in some strenuous activity, whether walking or working, so that
your body is warmed up, and then you should eat. As the verse says,
“By the sweat of your brow you shall eat bread,” and “She does not eat
the bread of laziness.” You should loosen your belt before eating. This is

should sit in your place or recline on your left side. After eating, don’t
move about excessively, because that will cause the food to descend
from the stomach before it has been fully digested, which can be
harmful; rather one should walk a little and rest. But you should not go
on a long walk or engage in strenuous activity after the meal. Nor
should you sleep till at least two hours have elapsed after the meal, so
that the fumes will not ascend to the head and cause damage. Likewise,
bathing, bloodletting and sexual intercourse are not beneficial after a
meal.
7

People are not all alike in temperament. Some have a hot temperament,
some cool, some intermediate. Foods likewise are varied. If you have an
intermediate temperament, you should eat foods that are median too.
But if your temperament is not an intermediate one, you should eat
foods that are the opposite of your temperament. If your temperament
is hot, you should not eat hot things like herbs and spices, but rather
things that are somewhat cold and pickled. If your temperament is
cool, you should eat foods that are somewhat hot. Similarly, the food
should be adjusted in accordance with the season and the climate: In





the summer you should eat cold foods, like the meat of tender lambs or
kids, and young chickens, and also some pickled foods. And in the
winter, eat hot foods. Similarly, in a cold country you should eat hot
foods, and in a hot country you should eat cold foods.
8

The median food is bread made from wheat, but not of the purest
flour, for bread made of the purest flour is digested at a slower pace. It
should rather contain some bran, and it should be moderately risen,
contain salt, and baked in an oven. Other foods made of wheat are not
beneficial. Of the varieties of meat, the best is that of a yearling lamb or
of suckling kids. But in all cases the innards, and also the head, are not
beneficial. The meat of goat and old cows, and old cheese, are bad and
turgid foods. All bird’s meat is digested more easily than that of
animals, and the best type of bird is chicken. Physicians have stated that
if you are accustomed to a particular food, even if it is bad food, it does
not harm you, because habit becomes second nature—provided that
you do not stuff yourself with such food.

9

You should not eat the heart of an animal or bird, because it is harmful
to your memory. Similarly, do not eat from a place where a rat or a cat
has bitten, for that too is harmful to your memory.

10

The time to eat is when you feel a true desire to eat, not an artificial
one. The distinction between a true desire and an artificial one is as
follows: The first is called “hunger,” because the stomach is empty; and
the second is when one desires a particular food, and it is called
“appetite.” In general, a healthy and strong person should eat twice each
day. Weak and old people should eat only a little at a time, and do so
many times each day, for too much food weakens the stomach. If you





wish to guard your health, do not eat until your stomach is empty of
the previous meal. Normal digestion, for healthy people who eat and
exercise to an intermediate degree, takes six hours. It is advisable to skip
one meal each week to allow the stomach to rest from its work, thereby
strengthening the digestive capacity. It seems that the optimal time for
this skipping is on Friday, prior to Shabbat.
11

It is good to accustom yourself to eat bread in the morning.

12

If you wish to eat various types of food, you should first eat something
that has a laxative effect—but not mix this with your food; wait a while
between them. Also, eat the lighter food first, as it digests more easily—
for example, poultry before meat, and the meat of a more delicate
animal before the meat of a larger animal. Foods that have a costive
effect on the intestines should be eaten directly after the meal, but you
should not eat very much of them.

13

Because the digestive process begins in the mouth, where the teeth
grind the food and where it is mixed with saliva, you should therefore
not swallow food without chewing, because it will then be difficult for
the stomach alone to digest it.

14

We have already noted (in paragraph 7) that people are not all alike in
their temperament, so that each person should follow physicians’ advice
and accordingly choose the food that is best for them according to their
temperament, their location, and their time. In general terms, the
ancient physicians divided foodstuffs into various grades. There are
foods that are extremely detrimental, and it is recommended to never
eat them. These include: large fish that are salted and aged, aged salted





cheese, truffles and mushrooms, aged salted meat, [unfermented] wine
from the press, and any cooked food that has been left to the point that
it gives off an odor. Likewise, any food that has a bad smell or a very
bitter taste is like deadly poison to the body. There are other foods that
are harmful, but not as detrimental as those already mentioned.
Therefore it is recommended to eat them only in small quantities and
at long intervals; don’t be in the habit of making them your regular diet
or part of your regular diet. These include: large fish, cheese, milk that
has been left for more than twenty-four hours since it was milked, the
meat of large oxen or large male goats, barley bread, matzah, cabbage,
leeks, onions, garlic, mustard and radishes. All of these are harmful, and
it is recommended that one eat only a little of these, and only during
the winter. But in the summer, one should not eat these at all.
15

There are other foods that are harmful, but not to the same degree as
those mentioned. These include: water birds (geese and ducks), young
pigeons, dates, bread that was kneaded with oil, and fine flour that has
been so thoroughly sifted that no hint of bran remains. It is not
recommended to eat much of these foods.

16

You should always abstain from eating tree fruits. Even when they are
dried, you should not eat too many of them, and certainly not when
they are fresh. But before they have ripened fully they are like swords to
the body. Carobs, too, are always harmful. All tart fruits are harmful,
and they should be eaten only in small portions during the summer or
in hot climates. Figs, grapes, and pomegranates are always beneficial,
whether fresh or dried, and you may eat of them as much as you need.
Nevertheless, you should not eat them constantly, though they are the
best of all the tree fruits.




17


As regards drinks, water is the natural liquid for a human being and for
the health of the body. If they are pure and clear, they are beneficial in
that they maintain the body’s moisture and hasten the ejection of waste.
When you drink water, it is preferable that it be cold, because it
quenches thirst and improves digestion more than water that is not
cold. But it should not be very cold, because that extinguishes the
natural heat [of the body]. All the more so, when you are tired and
exhausted, you should be very careful to not drink [very] cold water, for
then the fat of the heart is heated and melted because of tiredness and
exhaustion, and cold water is harmful to the point that you might be
endangered, G-d forbid. Now although water is good for the health of
the body, nevertheless you should not drink too much of it. You should
not drink water before a meal, for it will cool down the stomach and it
will not be able to digest the food properly. During the meal, too, you
should not drink anything other than a bit of water mixed with wine.
Only once the food has begun to be digested should you drink a
moderate serving of water. Likewise, you should not drink water when
you exit the bathhouse, so that the liver is not chilled; certainly you
should not drink in the bathhouse. Likewise, you should not drink
water directly after sexual intercourse, for then your natural heat is
weakened, and it will cause the limbs to become chilled.

18

Wine fortifies the natural heat, improves digestion, helps to eject excess
waste, and aids the health of the body, so long as you drink a moderate
measure. If your head is weak, avoid wine, for it will make you weaker
and fill your head with fumes. Wine is good for older people but
harmful for youths, for it arouses the natural heat and is like adding fire
to fire. You should avoid wine until the age of twenty-one. It is not





recommended to drink wine before a meal—except a little in order to
open up the innards—nor when you are hungry, have just exited the
bathhouse or sauna, or have just exercised or worked hard. During the
meal, you should drink only a little.
19

You should never eat unless you are hungry, nor drink unless you are
thirsty, nor wait to defecate for even one moment. You should also not
eat till you have thoroughly checked whether you need to eliminate.

20

You should always endeavor to keep your bowels lax throughout your
life; they should be approaching a mild diarrheic state. A general rule of
health is that whenever there is constipation or difficulty in defecating,
harmful illnesses are on the way. Therefore, if you see that your bowels
have weakened and have lost the power of ejecting, you should consult
doctors for advice on how to loosen them, each person according to his
temperament and age.

21

A moderate amount of exercise is good for the body’s health (see above,
paragraph 6). But strenuous exercise, and also rest, are detrimental to
the body. In the summer one should exercise only a little, and during
the winter you need more. A fat person must exercise more than a thin
one.

22

If you want to guard your health, you must be familiar with your
emotional reactions and be cautious with them. Examples of these are
joy, anxiety, anger and fear, all of which have psychological impact. An
intelligent person should be happy with the portion granted to him
during his transitory life, not anxious about a world that is not his own.
You should not seek luxuries, but should be satisfied and moderately





joyful, for this aids the improvement of the natural body heat, digestion
of food and expulsion of waste, and strengthening of the sense of vision
and all other senses; it also strengthens the intellectual faculties. But
you should not try to increase your happiness by feasting and drinking,
as fools do, because too much happiness brings body heat to the
surface, sapping the body’s natural warmth, so that the heart becomes
chilled rapidly and the person may die prematurely and suddenly. This
especially occurs to people whose bodies are corpulent, for they have
less natural heat in their bodies because their blood vessels are narrow
and the circulation, which is source of the body’s heat, is slow. Anxiety
is the opposite of joy, and it too is harmful, for it cools the body, so that
the natural heat may converge on the heart and cause one’s death.
Anger stokes the heat of the body, to the point that it can induce one or
another kind of fever. Fear brings a chill to the body—thus, a fearful
person shivers—and if this chill becomes too much, he may die.
Needless to say, you should be careful not to eat when angry, fearful or
anxious, but rather when in a moderately joyful mood.
23

Sleep in moderation is good for the health of the body; then the food is
digested and the faculties are at rest. If it happens that one is unable to
sleep due to illness, he should eat foods that induce sleepiness. But too
much sleep is detrimental, for the head then becomes filled with fumes
which ascend from the belly to the brain; when the head is filled with
such fumes, it causes great damage to the body. Just as you should be
careful not to sleep directly after eating, so should you take care not to
sleep when you are hungry, for when there is no food in the body, its
heat acts on the excess [food waste], producing degraded fumes that
ascend to the brain. When you sleep, your head should be raised up
[higher than the rest of the body], for this will allow the food to





descend from the opening of the stomach, and will decrease the
amount of fumes that ascend to the brain. Natural sleep occurs at
night. Sleep during the day is harmful, and is beneficial only to those
who are accustomed to it (see more in chapter 71).
24

The norm for bathing is that you should enter the bathhouse once in
seven days. You should not enter the bathhouse when hungry, nor
when you are full, but when the food has begun to be digested. You
should first wash your body with hot water, then with warm water,
then with lukewarm, and finally with cold water. When you exit the
bath, you should dress and cover your head well, so that it should not
be exposed to cold air; even in the summer season, you must take care
with this. Afterwards you should wait till your spirit is settled, your
body is rested and the heat has dissipated; then you can eat. If you nap
for a short time after exiting the bathhouse and before eating, that is
very beneficial.

25

You should always try to live in a place where the air is pure and clean,
high up and in a spacious building. If possible, in the summer you
should not live in a place that is open to the north or to the east, and
there should be nothing foul-smelling nearby. It is very good to clean
the air of the home constantly with good scents and beneficial
fumigants.

26

The air that is best for the health of the body is of average temperature,
neither too cold nor too hot. Therefore everyone should be careful not
to overheat their homes during the winter, as unthinking people do,
because excessive heat encourages the onset of many grave illnesses, G-d





forbid. Rather, you should heat your home only to the point where you
do not feel any coldness but also do not feel too hot.
27

To preserve your sense of sight, take the following precautions: Do not
come suddenly, all at once, from a dark place to a well-lit one. If you
need to enter from a dark place to a lighted one, open the door a bit
and look at that small amount of light for a few moments, then open it
more and again look at that light for a few moments, and then open it
completely. Do the same when going from a lighted area to a dark one.
This is because the shift from light to darkness, or from darkness to
light, without any transition, damages the sense of sight. For this reason
G-d, blessed be His name, in His great mercy created the world in such
a way that the sun shines upon the earth little by little, not all at once,
and likewise sets little by little. For this we bless Him as “the One who
illuminates the earth and those who dwell upon it, with mercy,”
meaning that He mercifully makes the sun shine little by little, and not
suddenly, all at once. Reflected light from the sun—meaning that the
sun shines on something and from there the light is reflected—is a light
that is damaging to the eyes. Therefore you should take care not to
dwell in a house where all the windows are on the north side, because
the sun does not come to the north, so that all the light that comes
from that side is only reflected light. Similarly, even if the windows are
on the eastern, southern or western sides, if you cannot see the sky
through the windows—for example, if there are high walls opposite
them—then the light that comes through them is also only reflected
light. You should take care not to be occupied with writing, reading a
book, or any sort of detailed work by twilight, or in the middle of the
day, when the sun’s light is at full strength. You should also not do too
much writing, reading of books with fine print, or any other sort of





detailed work by candlelight at night. Too much staring at the color
white also damages the eyes; that is why the sky appears blue, not
white, so it should not damage the eyes. Likewise, staring excessively at
a bright red color, or at fire, is also damaging. Smoke and sulfurous
fumes are also damaging, as are fine dust and wind that blows into one’s
eyes. Also too much walking and large strides, and excessive crying [are
harmful], as the verse says, “My eyes are spent with tears.” Most
detrimental of all is excessive sexual intercourse. By contrast, “the
commandment of G-d is clear, enlightening the eyes.”

It is forbidden to eat fish together with meat, even with poultry fat,
because it is hazardous. You should not broil meat together with fish in
the same oven if the oven is small, unless either [the meat or the fish] is
covered. But in our ovens which are large, you need not be concerned
[and it is permissible].

2

If you eat fish followed by meat or vice versa, you should eat some
bread in between and drink some beverage as this will cleanse and rinse
[your mouth].

3

You should be careful of bodily perspiration, for all bodily perspiration
is poisonous except that of the face. Therefore, you should be careful
not to place any food between your clothes and your body, because of
the perspiration. Neither should you put coins into your mouth, for
there may be some perspiration on them, and furthermore, many
people handle them and there may be sick people among them.




4


When you smell the odor of food, you should spit out all the saliva in
your mouth and not swallow it; for if you swallow it, it could be
hazardous, God forbid.

5

Be careful not to drink water that has been left uncovered.

6

It is forbidden to place any food or drink underneath a bed even if it is
covered, because an evil spirit abides over them. In villages some people
keep potatoes and other foods underneath the beds; —they should be
warned against this.

7

You should beware of all things that are hazardous because ""Rules that
aim to prevent danger are more strict than ritual prohibitions."" You
must be more concerned with regard to a possible hazard than with a
possible violation of a prohibition. It is therefore forbidden to walk in
any dangerous place, such as near a leaning wall and over a delapidated
bridge. You should not go out alone at night, nor should you sleep
alone in a room at night. It is also forbidden to drink water from rivers
at night, or to put your mouth into a water spout to drink, lest you
swallow something harmful.

8

It is customary, at the time of the equinox to place a small piece of iron
on all beverages and foods, but on food that is cooked or pickled, or
kept in salt it is unnecessary.

9

You must not eat foods and beverages that are repulsive or [eat or
drink] out of unclean dishes that are repulsive. Neither should you eat
with dirty hands, for all these things are included [in the Biblical
injunction,] ""Do not make yourself repulsive."" Even if a person would





say that he has no aversion to these things, his opinion is ignored since
it defies the accepted norms of society.
10

An animal or bird that was seriously sick may be eaten after the
shechitah (Kosher slaughter). [Nevertheless], those who are meticulous
[in their observance] are stringent and do not eat such meat.

11

It is forbidden to cut down a fruit tree which bears fruit (e. g. an olive
tree which produces [at least] a quarter of a kav of olives or a date tree
which produces [at least] a kav of dates) because it is hazardous. But if
it grows near other trees that are more valuable and it saps their
strength, [by depriving them of nutrients] or if you need the space it
takes up then, you are allowed to cut it down.

12

There are some who recommend placing a hot water bottle on the
stomach as a remedy for a stomach-ache. This is forbidden as it is
dangerous.

13

You should not cross a stream whose waters are moving rapidly if the
water reaches above the hips, for there is danger of being swept along
by the current.

14

It is forbidden to utter sinister forbodings against a fellow Jew, even just
to say [about a missing person], ""If so and so were alive he would have
come here,"" for ""A covenant was made with the lips."" You should not
frighten a child with an unclean thing, by saying for instance, ""A cat or
a dog will get you."" You should be very careful [to avoid] habitual use
of such similar expressions.

It is a positive commandment to give charity to poor Jewish people, as
it is said ""Open your hand to him."" And it is said: ""That your brother
may live with you."" Anyone who sees a poor person seeking help and
ignores him, and does not give him charity, transgresses a prohibitive
commandment, as it is said: ""Do not harden your heart nor shut your
hand from your brother in need."" [Giving] charity is a characteristic of
the descendants of Abraham, as it is said: ""For I have a special love for
him because he commands his children and his household after him [to
preserve the way of Hashem] doing charity and justice."" And the
throne of Israel will be established and the religion of truth confirmed
only through charity, as it is said: ""Through charity will you be
reestablished."" Greater is he who performs acts of charity than [one
who brings] all the sacrifices, as it is said: ""Performing acts of charity
and justice is more desirable to Hashem than sacrifices."" The Jewish
people will be redeemed only through [the merit of ] charity, as it is
said: ""Zion will be redeemed through justice and its captives through
acts of charity."" A person never becomes poor through giving charity,
nor will any evil or harm befall him because of his giving charity, as it is
said: Through acts of charity, there will be peace."" Whoever is merciful
with others will be treated with mercy [from Heaven], as it is said: ""He
[God] will show you mercy; and have compassion upon you and
multiply you."" Anyone who is cruel, causes his lineage to be suspect.
The Holy One blessed is He, is near to the cry of the poor, as it is said:
""He will hear the cry of the poor."" Therefore one must beware of their
anguished cry, for a covenant was made with them, as it is said: ""When
he cries out to me I will listen, for I am compassionate."" The Jerusalem





Talmud says: The door that doesn't open for the poor will open for the
doctor. A person should consider, that he continually requests his
sustenance from the Holy One blessed is He; and just as he requests
that the Holy One blessed is He, listen to his cry and prayer, so should
he listen to the cry of the poor. A person should also consider that
[fortune] is a wheel that revolves in the world, and in the end he or his
children or his children's children might [have to] accept charity. Let no
man think: ""Why should I diminish my wealth by giving it to the
poor?"" For he should know that the money is not his, but rather [it was
given to him as] a trust, with which to do the will of the One Who
entrusted the funds to him. And this [charity giving] will be his real
share from all his toils in this world, As it is written: ""Your acts of
charity shall preceed you [into the World to Come]. Charity voids evil
decrees and prolongs life.
2

Every person must give charity according to his means. Even a poor
person who is supported by charity, [must give charity in some
situations]. For example, if he has a little money of his own that is not
invested, he is permitted to receive charity, since he does not have
enough capital to support himself from the profits of the capital;
nevertheless, since he does have from what to support himself, he is
required to give charity from that which is given to him. Even if he can
give only a small amount, he should not refrain from giving it, because
his small contribution is as valued as the large contribution of the
wealthy person. And so have said our Rabbis of blessed memory. It is
said concerning the burnt-offering of an animal, ""A fire offering of
pleasing savor,"" and concerning the burnt offering of a fowl [It is also
said] ""A fire offering of pleasing savor,"" and concerning the meal
offering [it is also said] ""A fire offering of pleasing savor."" This teaches





us that one who does much and one who does little [are equally
meritorious] provided his intentions and heart are directed to his Father
in heaven. However, anyone who has only enough for his own
sustenance, is not obligated to give charity, because his own sustenance
takes precedence over all others.
3

How much should a poor person be given? A sufficient amount to
supply his needs. But this is [said only] for a poor person who receives
charity in a discreet manner. It is then incumbent upon the people of
the city to supply him with all his needs, in the manner he was
accustomed before he became poor; but a poor person who goes
begging door to door, should be given a small sum according to his
situation. In any event, in every city he should be given bread and food
sufficient for two meals, and a place to sleep. We should also support
and clothe the non-Jewish poor together with the Jewish poor for the
sake of peace[ful relationships].

4

How much charity should you give? The first year you should give a
tenth of the principle; and thereafter, you should give a tenth of the
profits you earn each year, [after deducting your household expenses.]
This is the medial way [of giving charity]. The commandment is
fulfilled in its excellence when you give a fifth the first year from the
principle, and every year after that a fifth of the profits. You should not
give away more than a fifth, so that you will not become dependent on
others. This rule applies only during your lifetime. But as a dying
bequest, you are permitted to [donate] up to a third of your estate to
charity. You may not use your ma'aseir [charity] funds for other mitzvah
obligations, such as buying candles for the synagogue or other items
used for a mitzvah, but you must give it to the poor. If you have the





opportunity to perform a mitzvah to help in the circumcision of a
child, or to marry off a poor bride and groom, or similar situations; or
to purchase Torah texts from which to study, and lend them to others
for study; you may use the ma'aseir money if you would not be able to
accomplish these deeds with your own money. If you buy Torah texts
from ma'aseir money, you must be sure to lend them to others; but if
you need them yourself, than your needs come first. You should also be
sure to inscribe in them that they are from ma'aseir money, so that
possession is not taken of them by your children after you.
5

If you want to gain merit for yourself, supress your evil inclination, and
be generous [with your money]; and anything you do for the sake of
heaven should be the best and the most beautiful. When you build a
house of prayer [synagogue], it should be nicer than your own dwelling.
When you feed a hungry person, give him the best and tastiest of your
table. When your give clothing to the unclad, clothe him from the best
of your clothes. If you consecrate something [for the service of God],
consecrate from the best of your possessions, as it is said: ""All the fat
[prime parts] to Hashem.""

6

If you support your grown children whom you are not obligated to
support [those over the age of six], in order to teach your sons Torah,
and your daughters to lead proper lives, similarly, if you support your
father [or mother] (and you are not able to support them except by
using your charity money,) and they need this support—this constitutes
charity; and what is more, they take precedence over others. Even if it is
not a son or a father but only a relative, he takes precedence over
anyone else. And the poor person in your your house takes precedence
over the poor in your city, and the poor of your city takes precedence





over the poor of another city, as it is said: ""To your brother, to your
poor, to your needy in your land."" But the treasurer who distributes
communal charity, must be careful not to give his relatives more than
[he gives] to the other poor people.
7

Whoever gives charity to a poor person with an angry countenance,
even if he gives a thousand gold pieces, he has forfeited his merit
[reward], and he violates the prohibition: ""Your heart shall not be sorry
[when you give him charity]."" But rather you must give to him with a
smiling countenance and with joy, and commiserate with his suffering,
as Job said: ""Did I not cry for the troubled, was my soul not grieved for
the needy."" And speak to him words of comfort as it is said: ""And the
heart of the widow, I caused to sing for joy.""

8

It is forbidden to turn away a poor person, empty handed, even if you
give him only a dried fig [a mere pittance], as it is said: ""Let not the
oppressed turn back in disgrace."" And if you have nothing to give him,
console him with words. It is forbidden to scold a poor person or to
raise your voice to him in a shout, because he is brokenhearted and
humbled, as it is said: ""A heart that is broken and humbled God does
not despise."" Woe is to him who embarrasses the poor. Rather act
towards him like a father, both in [feelings of ] compassion and with
words, as it is said: ""I was a father to the poor.""

9

Charity is in the category of vows. Therefore, if you say, ""I will donate
money to charity"" or ""this coin is charity"" you must immediately give it
to the poor, and if you delay [giving it to them] you are in violation of
the commandment, ""You must not delay,"" because you could have
given it immediately. If there are no poor people available, you may set





the money aside until you find some poor people. If you pledge charity
in the synagogue which is to be entrusted to the treasurer, you are not
in violation until the treasurer demands the money. Then [if you do not
give it] you are immediately in violation; unless you know that he
doesn't need the money for immediate [distribution] but will merely
hold it in his possession.
10

If you say, ""I will give charity to a specific person,"" you are not in
violation [of your vow] until that poor person comes. Every person has
the right to set aside money for charity, keep it in his possession, and
distribute it a little at a time as he sees fit.

11

If you persuade others to give charity and you motivate them, your
reward is greater than the giver, as it is said: ""And the work[er] of
charity will be [rewarded with] peace."" And about the treasurers of
charity, and others like them who collect charity, it is said: ""Those who
cause others to be righteous [shall shine] as the stars."" And the treasurer
of charity who is insulted by the poor, should not be concerned, for on
account of this, his reward is even greater.

12

The highest form above which there is none higher, in the level of
giving charity, is to support a Jew who is in bad financial circumstances,
before he becomes totally impoverished. [Such aid may be rendered] —
by giving him an appropriate gift in a dignified manner, or lending him
money, or entering into a partnership with him, or helping him find a
business venture, or craft, to strengthen his position so that he does not
become dependent on people. Concerning this it is said: ""Strengthen
him"" which means, support him so that he does not fall.




13


You should take care to give charity as discreetfully as possible. And if it
is possible to give it in such a way that you do not know to who you are
giving, and the poor person does not know from whom he is receiving
[the charity], this is most commendable. In any event do not glorify
yourself with the charity you give; however, if you dedicate something
to charity, it is permissible to inscribe your name on it, as a
rememberance [memorial]. [In fact] it is advisable to do so.

14

One has to be especially careful to help a poor Torah scholar, in a
dignified manner. And if he refuses to accept [charity], help him in
some sort of business—sell him goods cheaply and buy his goods at a
high price; and if he [the poor scholar] is capable of engaging in trade,
lend him money to use in trade. As our Sages of blessed memory said:
""Whoever supplies merchandise to a Torah scholar merits to participate
in the heavenly Yeshiva."" And they said: ""All the prophets predictions
of good fortune were said only of one who provides business
opportunities for a Torah scholar and gives his daughter in marriage to
a Torah scholar.""

15

A person should always avoid taking charity. He should suffer hardship
rather than depend on people. And so did our Sages of blessed memory
command, ""Make your Sabbath like a weekday rather than be
dependent upon others."" Even if an honored scholar becomes
impoverished, he should find some occupation even a lowly job, rather
than depend on people.

16

Whoever has no need to take charity, and deceives people and takes,
will not die before actually needing charity. Anyone who needs to take





[charity], and cannot survive unless he takes [charity], for example, one
who is old, sick or suffering, but whose pride doesn't allow him to take
[charity], sheds [his own] blood and is liable for his own life, and all he
has for his suffering are sins. Anyone who needs [charity] and inflicts
himself with suffering and ""bides his time,"" and lives a life of suffering
in order not to burden the community, will not die before acquiring the
means to support others. And about him it is said: ""Blessed is the man
who trusts in Hashem.
"

Dough which is made of the five grains require the separation of
challah. Before separating challah the following berachah is said: Baruch
ata Adonoy, Elokeinu, Melech ha'olam asher kideshanu bemitzvosav
vetzivanu lehafrish challah [min ha'isah.] A kazayis of dough is then
taken and burned in fire. The custom is to burn it in the oven in which
the bread will be baked.

2

What is the minimum amount of dough from which you must separate
challah? An amount containing 5 quarters of flour, which is equivalent
[to the displacement of ] 43 and 1/5 eggs.

3

Matzos which are baked for Pesach, even though each individual batch
does not have the required amount of flour, nevertheless, since the
matzos are placed in one container, the container combines them into
one unit and you must separate challah. You must be careful that all the
matzos are inside the container. Even though part of a matzoh is inside
the container and some of it protrudes out of the container, it is,





nevertheless, considered as one unit. But if whole matzos are lying
above [outside] the container and are not [at all] inside the container,
they cannot be considered joined to the rest; and even if they are
covered by a cloth, it is not sufficient. But if you place the matzos in a
sheet and you cover them with this same sheet, the sheet is considered
like a container and it combines all the matzos into one unit, even
though in the middle some of the matzos are uncovered. But be careful
that a whole matzah does not protrude outside of the covering.
4

Leaven taken from dough for the purpose of fermenting other dough,
must be removed before separating challah. But leaven which is taken
for fermenting liquids called borscht, should be removed after you have
separated challah.

5

After Pesach when you buy leaven from a non-Jew to ferment dough, be
careful to separate a piece of dough for challah which is greater in size
than the leaven [bought from the non-Jew].

6

When you make dough for cooking or frying, separate challah without
reciting the berachah. But if you intend baking some of the dough,
even a small portion, separate challah with a berachah.

7

If the dough is kneaded with eggs or fruit juices, many questions arise
[concerning the requirement for challah], therefore you should add
some water, milk, bee honey, wine or olive oil when kneading the
dough. Then the challah may be separated with a berachah.

8

The mitzvah of separating the challah is the province of the woman of
the house. But if the woman is not home, and there is concern that by





the time she returns the dough will be ruined, then the maid [obviously
a Jewish maid] or someone else may separate the challah.
9

If you forget to separate challah on Friday, [from the bread to be eaten
on Shabbos], in countries outside the land of Israel you may eat it on
Shabbos, but you must set aside one piece, and separate challah from it
after Shabbos is over. The piece should be large enough for the
separation of challah with some remaining dough unsanctified, for
there must be a noticeable remainder. If the day before Pesach occurs on
Shabbos and you forgot to separate challah, from the challos baked for
Shabbos there is a great controversy [as to the best procedure to follow.]
Therefore, be especially careful on the day preceeding Shabbos, to
remember to separate challah.
"

Before meat is salted it must be thoroughly washed with water. The
meat must be soaked in water for approximately a half hour, and the
water must completely cover the meat. Where actual blood is visible on
the meat, it must be rubbed off in the water in which it is soaked and
removed. Similarly [when salting] fowl, you must thoroughly rub the
place where the cut was made, [when it was killed.] Similarly on the
inside [of the animal] where actual blood is visible. Occasionally meat
or fowl may have a blood clot due to a wound—this place must be cut
off and removed before the meat is soaked. If the water is very cold, it
must first be set in a warm place to reduce the coldness before the meat
is soaked in it, because if the water is very cold the meat will harden
and will not expunge the blood during the salting.




2


If you forgot and allowed the meat to soak in water for twenty-four
hours, then both the meat and the vessel are forbidden [to be used]. If
you soaked liver in water for twenty-four hours, consult a competent
Rabbinic authority.

3

On the day of erev Shabbos when you have no time, or in a similar
situation when you are pressed for time; it is sufficient to rub the meat
well in water, and let it soak for a short while in water, and if there is no
redness in the water you may salt it.

4

If after soaking, one piece was cut into two, you must wash the place
where the cutting was done very thoroughyly because of the blood that
is there.

5

Meat that is frozen must be thawed out [before it is salted], but it may
not be placed near a heated oven. In an exceptionally pressing situation,
it may be soaked in lukewarm water.

6

The vessel set aside for the soaking of meat may not be used for any
other food.

7

After the meat has been soaked, the water must be drained from it, so
that the salt does not dissolve because of the water, and become
ineffective in drawing out the blood. Care must be taken [however]
that the meat is not totally dry, so that the salt does not fall off [the
meat].

8

The salt should not be as fine as flour, because it will dissolve
immediately, and will not draw out blood. It should also not be too





[coarse], as it might fall off the meat. It should be of medium size, like
the salt processed through cooking, and it should be dry so that it
spreads well.
9

The salt must be spread on all sides of the meat, so that no place is left
without salt. Therefore, [when salting], poultry must be opened
properly, so that it can be salted properly on the inside as well.

10

When meat is salted, it must be placed on a surface where the blood
can easily drain off. Therefore, the basket with the meat should not be
set on the ground, because the blood will not drain easily. Even after
the meat has remained in salt for the prescribed length of time before it
is rinsed off, it should not be set in a place where the blood cannot flow
freely from it. When meat is salted on a board, the board must be
slanted, so that the blood flows freely and the salting board must not
have a groove into which brine might accummulate. When salting
poultry (fowl) or a complete side of beef which has an inside and a
cavity, the hollow side must be turned downward, so that the blood will
drain freely.

11

The meat should remain in the salt for an hour. In an exceptionally
pressing situation twenty-four minutes is sufficient.

12

After the meat has remained in the salt for the prescribed time, the salt
should be thoroughly shaken off, and the meat rinsed three times in
water, very thoroughly. And a God-fearing woman should personally
supervise the rinsing off of the meat, because sometimes the maid who
must carry the water on her shoulder, will be sparing [with the water],
which could cause, God forbid, [a violation] of the prohibition of





[eating] blood. Care must be taken not to leave unrinsed meat inside a
vessel without water.
13

When kashering poultry, take care to remove the head before soaking,
and if the poultry was salted with the head attached, consult a
competent Rabbinic authority. The same precaution applies when
kashering an animal.

14

Unsalted meat, should not be put in a place where salt is sometimes
kept. A special vessel should be set aside specifically for [unsoaked and
unsalted] meat. Vegetables, or fruit, or similar food items, which are
usually eaten without being washed should not be placed in this vessel,
because blood from the meat clings to the vessel, and from the vessel it
will cling to the food.

15

When kashering the head, it must be split open before soaking, the
brain must be removed, and the membrane covering it, opened. The
brain must be soaked and salted separately. The head must be salted on
the inside and outside and may be salted even with its hairs.

16

Bones containing marrow, that are still attached to the meat, may be
salted together with the meat as they are, but if they are disconnected
from the meat, they must be salted separately, and should not be placed
near the meat while salted.

17

When kashering animal feet, the tips of the hoofs must be cut off before
they are soaked so that the blood may drain from them, and they must
be placed [in the salt] in such a way [the hoofs downward] that the
blood can drain; and they, too, may be salted with its hairs.




18


The heart, must be cut open before soaking it, so that the blood flows
from it.

19

It is also customary to cut open the lungs and to open up the large
tubes before soaking them.

20

Since liver contains a large amount of blood, it is not proper [as it is
with ordinary meat and poultry] to cook by virtue of its being salted. It
must be broiled over a fire. Prior to broiling it must be cut open very
well, and the open parts placed on the fire so that the fire effectively
draws out all the blood contained in the liver. The liver must be rinsed
before placing it on the fire; and when placed on the fire, it should be
lightly sprinkled with salt. It should be broiled until it becomes edible.
[After broiling] it should be rinsed well of the blood it discharged. Care
should be taken that it be rinsed three times, and then it may be
cooked.

21

Liver must be broiled only on an open fire and not in an oven that has
been raked [from coal and ashes]. It must not be wrapped in paper to
be broiled, even if the paper is thin.

22

Liver must not be salted before broiling, as is done with ordinary meat
and certainly liver must not be salted together with meat.

23

The spleen is kashered in the same manner as ordinary meat, but the
membrane must be removed from it before soaking, for it is in the
category of forbidden fat. It must also be purged of any veins. The tip
of the vein should be grasped and pulled out. This will also pull along
the three cords [of veins] that are inside. Care must be taken that none





of these cords are severed. If any of them happens to become severed,
they must be dug out.
24

The mesentery [membrane] and the other intestines should be salted
on their exterior to which the fat clings.

25

If milk is found in the stomach of a calf, it must be spilled out before
soaking it, and then you may treat it like any other meat.

26

Eggs found inside poultry, whether they are very small or completely
developed with their shells, must be soaked, salted and rinsed. They
should not be salted near the meat, rather, they should be put in a place
where the blood of the meat will not drain on them. Such eggs, even if
they were fully developed should not be eaten with milk.

27

Meat that was left unsalted for three consecutive [24 hour] days must
not be cooked unless it was soaked during the interim.

28

It is customary that after the feathers of poultry are plucked, it is singed
over fire to remove the remaining feathers. Care must be taken to singe
them only over a flame fueled by straw, and not over a large flame. Care
must be taken to move the poultry to and fro so that they do not
become heated.

When you buy metal or glass utensils that are used for food from a
non-Jew, even when they are new, you may not use them for any [food
related] purpose even if the food is cold, unless they are immersed in a
natural spring or mikvah, that is valid for the ritual immersion of





women at the end of the menstrual period. The purpose of this
immersion is to elevate these utensils from the impurity of heathen
ownership to the holiness of Jewish ownership. Before the ritual
immersion, the following berachah is recited, if you are immersing one

2

Since the utensils must be immersed only in a place that is valid for the
immersion of women, therefore, care must be taken not to immerse
them in rivers when they are fuller than usual from abundant rains, and
melting snow. This occurs very frequently before Pesach when the rivers
rise, and [still] people use them to immerse utensils; and this is not
proper (see Chapter 162:12, 13).

3

Wooden utensils do not require immersion, but if they have metal
hoops, they should be immersed without reciting the berachah.
Similarly, earthenware need not be immersed. But if they are plated on
the inside with lead, i.e. glazed, they must be immersed [but] without
reciting the berachah. The same law applies to 'porcelain' vessels.

4

If an old utensil was used by a non-Jew in such a manner that it
required [halachic] kashering such as placing it in boiling water, or
making it red hot through direct flame, it must first be kashered and
then immersed.

5

If you borrow or rent a utensil from a non-Jew, you do not have to
immerse it. But if you borrow or rent utensils from a Jewish merchant,
you have to immerse them, but without reciting the berachah. The





merchant should then inform subsequent buyers [of the immersion], so
that they do not immerse them [again] and recite an unnecessary
berachah.
6

If a factory that manufactures glass utensils is owned by a Jew but
whose workers are non-Jews, the utensils that are manufactured there
must be immersed without saying the berachah.

7

If a Jew gave silver or other metals to a non-Jewish craftsman to have
him make a utensil, or repair a utensil that had a hole, and could not
hold a revi'is, [the vessel] must be immersed without reciting the
berachah.

8

Immersion is required only for a utensil used for food which is ready to
be eaten immediately without any other preparation. The iron tools
used to prepare the matzos, or to cut the dough, and the needle used to
sew the [gullets for] stuffing, or similar things do not require
immersion. Since a knife used for slaughtering or for skinning an
animal, can be used for prepared food, and also trays upon which
matzos are placed, require immersion but without reciting the
berachah. A tripod upon which pots are placed need not be immersed
since the food itself does not touch the tripod. But a metal spit upon
which meat is roasted, should be immersed and a berachah recited.
Some authorities hold, that large glass utensils [pitchers] that are not
used for drinking, but rather to hold liquid to be poured into drinking
cups, are not considered meal-related and do not require immersion.
Other authorities, however, say that they should be immersed. They
should, therefore, be immersed without reciting the berachah.




9


A pepper grinder, must be immersed because of its metal part, but since
the bottom part into which the pepper falls, is made of wood, it need
not be immersed. A coffee grinder should be immersed without reciting
the berachah.

10

Care must be taken that a utensil be completely clean, and free of any
dirt or rust before immersing. (However, a rust stain or other dark spots
that commonly appear on utensils, and of which people are not
particular do not invalidate the immersion process.) The entire utensil
must be submerged at one time, so that the whole utensil is in the
water [at the same time]. A utensil and its handle, must be submerged
in the water at one time. If the person immersing the utensil intends
holding it in his hand [during the immersion], he should first immerse
his hand in the place where he will immerse [the vessel]. The utensil
should not be held tightly, but rather with an ordinary grip. If the
immersion is done by tying the utensil to a rope, as, for example, it is
being immersed in a well, care must be taken that the knot is loose so
that the water may reach every part of the utensil.

11

When immersing vessels with a narrow mouth, be very careful that they
remain immersed until they fill up with water, because it is necessary
for the water to cover the utensil from inside and outside.

12

Minors, either male or female, should not be entrusted with the
immersion of utensils.

13

It is forbidden to immerse utensils on Shabbos or Yom Tov. If you
forgot to immerse them prior [to Shabbos or Yom Tov, and do not have
any substitute] give them to a non-Jew as a gift and then borrow it





from him. If it is the type of utensil that can be used to draw water, in
an area where it is permissible to carry, draw water with it [from a
mikvah] and bring it home. This will not appear as a ritual immersion,
but the berachah should not be recited.
"

The Sages have forbidden us to eat bread baked by a non-Jew. There are
localities, however, that are lenient and they buy bread from a nonJewish baker when there is no Jewish baker in the vicinity, or even if
there is one, but his bread is inferior to that of the non-Jew. But they
were not lenient regarding the bread made privately by a non-Jew,
except in extraordinary circumstances. If you are traveling on the road
and kosher bread is available [in another town] you must wait [and buy
kosher bread] [if the town is] within the distance of a parsah. Bread is
not considered privately made unless [the non-Jew] made it for his own
family, but if he made it to sell, it is considered baker's bread, even
though he ordinarily does not [bake for the trade]. Similarly, a baker
who makes bread for his family is considered a private person. [And his
bread is called private bread.] There is an authority who maintains that
in a locality where there are no bakeries, it is even permissible to eat the
bread of a non-Jewish, private person, and you do not have to wait for
kosher [Jewish] bread, and this is the accepted custom.

2

If a Jew throws in even one piece of wood into the oven when it is
being heated, the bread is permitted and is not considered the bread of
a non-Jew.




3


The Sages forbid the bread of a non-Jew only if it is made from the five
grains; [wheat, barley, oats, rye, spelt] but bread made from legumes
[beans, peas, corn etc.] is not considered bread; and is also not
forbidden as food cooked by a non-Jew, because it is not fit to be served
on the table of kings.

4

Bread [of a non-Jew] which has been glazed with eggs, is forbidden
because of the eggs on it, for it is then considered as food cooked by a
non-Jew. Their wafers [cookies] that are baked in metal pans, since
there is reason to suspect that the pan was smeared with non-kosher fat,
are forbidden in any event, because the pan has absorbed [non-kosher
fat].

5

Dough made by a Jew, that is baked by a non-Jew, is worse than bread
of a non-Jew and it it is forbidden as is food cooked by a non-Jew,
unless the Jew prepared the oven by throwing in a piece of wood. Care
must be taken in this regard when sending something to be baked or
roasted in an oven of a non-Jewish baker, that a Jew should throw a
piece of wood into the oven, or that a Jew should place the bread or
pan into the oven.

6

If a non-Jew cooked or roasted something which cannot be eaten in its
raw state, and is fit to be served on the table of kings, as a relish or
dessert, it is forbidden as Bishul Akum. This is true even if it was cooked
in a Jew's utensils and in the house of a Jew. But something which is
edible in its raw state, or food that is not held in esteem, and would not
be served on the table of kings, is not forbidden as food cooked by a
non-Jew. You need not be concerned about the utensils of a non-Jew,





because it is assumed that most utensils were not used within the past
twenty-four hours.
7

When a non-Jewish maid works in a Jewish home and does the cooking
for the Jewish household, it is customary to be lenient [and to eat the
food], because it is impossible that some member of the household did
not stoke the fire.

8

However if she [the maid] cooks only for herself, it is unlikely that a
Jew would stoke the fire—and it is possible that even stoking would be
of no avail for this is worse than if she cooks for a Jew. Therefore, if she
cooked food which is subject to the rules of food cooked by a non-Jew
—then not only is the food forbidden, but even the utensils are
forbidden for use in cooking. If they were used inadvertently, a
competent Rabbi should be consulted.

9

Food cooked by a non-Jew on Shabbos, for a Jew who was sick, should
not be eaten after Shabbos even by the sick person if other food is
available. The utensils, however, may be used after twenty-four hours.

10

Even though an egg is fit to be swallowed raw, nevertheless, since it is
only eaten in this manner in unusual circumstances, if it is cooked by a
non-Jew, it is forbidden [to be eaten]. This ruling applies to similar
types of food.

11

Fruits not fully tree-ripened and which are eaten raw only in unusual
circumstances, when they are sugar coated by chefs, are forbidden as
food cooked by a non-Jew.




12


It is permitted to drink beer made from grains or honey, even when
sold in the house of a non-Jew, and it is not considered food cooked by
a non-Jew, because the grain is neutralized in the water. However, it is
necessary to investigate whether or not it was fortified with wine
sediment. In localities where Jews are careless and lax, in regard to
drinking non-Jewish wine, a conscientious Jew should refrain from
drinking even [non-Jewish] beer. In regard to drinking coffee (without
milk for with milk it is surely prohibited), chocolate or tea made by a
non-Jew, a conscientious Jew should refrain from drinking them. There
are authorities, [however,] who permit drinking them occasionally, but
as a regular practice it is forbidden.

13

Milk, that was milked by a non-Jew, without Jewish supervision, is
forbidden; and it is even forbidden to make cheese from it. Initially a
Jew must be present when the milking is begun, and see that the
milking pail is clean. It is also customary to refrain from milking into a
pail generally used by a non-Jew for milking. Non-Jewish maids that
milk [the Jews'] cows on the premises of a Jew or in their own barn, if it
is situated so that a house of a non-Jew does not obstruct [the view of
the milking] and there is no danger of [their drawing] milk from an
unclean animal, it is permitted even initially to let them do the milking.
But if a non-Jewish house obstructs [the view], it is necessary to have
Jewish supervision. Even a minor, male or female over nine years old is
sufficient for this purpose.

14

Cheese made by a non-Jew is forbidden. But if a Jew supervised the
milking, and the making of the cheese, then, if during the process the





cheese was owned by a Jew, it is permitted to be eaten. If, however,
during the process it was owned by a non-Jew, it is forbidden.
15

The use of butter [of a non-Jew] depends on the custom of the various
localities. There are communities that do not eat butter made by a nonJew. There are other communities that do permit its use. If you travel
from a community where the butter is not eaten to one where it is
eaten, even though you plan to return to your original community, you
may eat the butter. And if you travel from a community where the
butter is eaten to a place where it is not, you may not eat the butter.
Presently [at the time of the author], it is rumored that the butter is
adulterated with lard. Therefore, conscientious Jews should refrain from
using it.
"
"1

If before washing [for the meal], you intend to eat various food that
will also be served during the meal, regardless whether these are foods
that require an [extra] berachah [when eaten] during the meal, such as
fruits, or if they are such foods that require no extra berachah [when
eaten] during the meal, such as relishes, legumes or potatoes; and also if
you intend to drink beverages (except for wine)—before washing your
hands, and you also intend to drink such beverages during the meal:
there is a disagreement among rabbinic authorities, if what you eat or
drink before washing your hands is exempt [from the after-berachah].
Some maintain that it is covered by the Birkas Hamazon, like the other
food eaten during the meal, and others hold that the food eaten before
washing the hands is not exempt with the Birkas Hamazon. Therefore it
is best to avoid [the problem] by eating or drinking these things only





before the meal, and say the after-berachah; and avoid eating or
drinking them during the meal. If you did not recite the after-berachah
before, you may say it during the meal or even after Birkas Hamazon.
And if you do eat or drink these foods during the meal, after saying
Birkas Hamazon, you should eat or drink something and say the afterberachah to exempt what you ate or drank before washing [your]
hands.
2

If you intend to drink wine before washing your hands, even though
you will not drink wine during the meal, nevertheless, some authorities
hold since the wine serves to stimulate the appetite, it is considered part
of the meal and is exempt with the Birkas Hamazon. Others hold
[however] that even if you drink wine during the meal, nevertheless, the
wine you drank before the meal is not exempt with Birkas Hamazon;
therefore, you should refrain from drinking [wine] before washing your
hands, unless you drink a cup of wine after Birkas Hamazon and say the
concluding berachah, Al Hagefen, which will also exempt [the wine]
you drank before washing your hands. If you intend to drink whiskey
before the meal, whether you intend to drink whiskey during the meal
or not, be careful not to drink a kazayis of whiskey before the meal [so
that a concluding berachah is not required]. But if you do drink a
kazayis or more it becomes a question whether a concluding berachah
[should be said.]

3

If before washing the hands you intend to eat, honey cake, egg kuchel,
or something similar, for which the after-berachah, Al Hamichyah, is
said, whether you eat such cake during the meal or not, nevertheless,
they are exempt with the Birkas Hamazon (because Birkas Hamazon
exempts Al Hamichyah.) This is true only if there is not a long delay





between eating [the cake] and washing the hands. But if you must wait
a long time you must first make the after-berachah Al Hamichyah on
the cake you ate, even if you intend to eat the same kinds of cake
during the meal.
"
"1

If you wish to eat bread for which Hamotzi is required, you must first
wash your hands. If the bread you are going to eat is the equivalent of
an egg, you must recite a berachah for the washing. But if you are going
to eat less, you do not recite the berachah upon washing.

2

For this washing you must use a halachically accepted utensil. The
utensil must be completely intact, without any holes or open cracks. It
must be level on top without grooves or projecting parts. When using
containers or pitchers having a spout protruding above the edge of the
utensil from which the water flows, you should not wash your hands
with water poured through the spout; because the spout does not have
the halachic status of a utensil, since it cannot hold liquid. Rather you
should wash from the side of the pitcher which contains the liquid.

3

A vessel that cannot stand without support—if it was originally made
to be used by means of this support, it is considered an halachic utensil.
But if it was not made to be used this way, for example, the cover of a
vessel, you should not wash with it. There are many halachic details on
this issue discussed in the Shulchan Aruch.

4

It is very difficult to estimate the exact amount of water to be used. You
should therefore pour a liberal amount of water on each hand, because





Rav Chisda says [Shabbos 62b] ""I washed with full handfuls of water
and was granted full handfuls of goodness."" You should wash your right
hand first and then your left. The water must cover your whole hand,
until the wrist, and no part of the hand should be untouched by water.
Therefore, in order to accomplish this, your fingers should be parted
slightly, and raised somewhat upward, so that the water reaches the
entire length of the fingers, the finger tips and the circumference of the
fingers. The water should be poured [on the hand] in one flow.
Therefore you should not wash from a container with a narrow mouth
[e.g. a soda bottle] from which the water cannot be emptied at one
time. It is also proper to pour water twice on each hand.
5

After you wash both hands rub them together and raise them opposite
your head as it is said: [Psalms 134:2 ] ""Lift up you hands"" etc. Before
you dry your hands recite the following berachah: Asher kiddeshanu
bemitzvosav vetzivanu al netilas yadayim, [Who has sanctified us with
His commandments and has commanded us regarding washing the
hands.] (Even though when performing other mitzvos the berachah is
recited before the performance of the mitzvah, nevertheless, in regard to
netilas yadayim, since there are times when one's hands are not clean
before washing, therefore, the Rabbis established that in all cases of
washing of hands, the berachah should be recited following the
washing. Another reason it is said then, is because the drying of the
hands is also part of the fulfillment of the commandment.) If it is your
custom to pour over water each hand twice, then pour first over each
hand once, rub them together and recite the berachah. Then pour a
second time over each hand. Be careful to dry your hands well. Do not
dry them with your clothes, because it is detrimental to the memory.




6


If after you pour water on one of your hands, you touch it with your
other hand, or if another person touches it, then the water on your
hands becomes impure, and you must then dry your hands and wash
them a second time. However, if this should occur after you have
already recited the berachah, do not repeat the berachah.

7

If you do not have a vessel, you can dip your hands into a river or into a
mikvah [ritualarium] that is halachically fit for the ritual immersion of
women or in a natural spring even if it does not contain forty seah of
water so long as your hands are covered by the water at one time. You
should also [in the case of dipping] recite the standard berachah, Al
Netilas Yadayim. In an emergency, you may immerse your hands in
snow, if there is enough snow on the ground equal to the amount
needed for a mikvah. If you have to wash your hands from a pump,
place one hand near the ground and with your other hand work the
pump to bring up the water. Afterwards, reverse the procedure or have
a friend draw the water for you. But if your hands are high above the
ground, the washing is invalid.

8

Water that becomes discolored, whether due to its location or due to
something that fell into the water, is unfit to be used for netilas
yadayim. [But] if the change of color was due to natural causes, the
water is fit for use. Water that was utilized for something, such as
washing dishes, or for soaking vegetables, or if the water was used to
store containers of beverage for cooling or the water was used for
measuring, it is unfit for the purpose of netilas yadayim. Some
authorities forbid using water that has become loathsome, for instance,





when a dog, a pig or other such animal drank from it, because it is
considered dirty water. One should take this opinion seriously.
9

If you had not washed your hands and you touched water, the water
does not become defiled. Therefore, upon leaving the lavatory, you may
take a handful of water out of the barrel to wash your hands, and the
remainder may be used for netilas yadayim [before meals]. However, if
you dabble your hand in the barrel to clean them, even if you dipped
only your little finger to clean it, all of the water is unfit since some
work was done with it.

10

Water that is salty, spoiled, bitter or muddy, if it is so bad that a dog
would not drink from it, it is unfit to be used for netilas yadayim.

11

Before you wash, inspect your hands to make sure that they are clean
without any chatzitzah. If you have long fingernails, clean them
carefully so that underneath them there is no mud or dirt because this
constitutes a chatzitzah. You must also remove your rings so that they
will not be a chatzitzah.

12

If your hands are colored with dye, but there is no substance to it,
merely the coloring, this does not constitute a chatzitzah; but if even a
little tangible dye-stuff is on your hands it is considered a chatzitzah.
However, if you are a craftsman such as a painter, or if you are a
butcher, and your hands are stained with blood, or you are a scribe, and
your hands are stained with ink, and this is their usual appearance and
other members of this craft are not concerned with these stains, they are
not considered a chatzitzah, unless the stains cover the greater part of
the hand. Similarly, if you have a wound on your hand, and there is a





bandage covering it, and it is painful to remove it, the bandage is not
considered a chatzitzah. (For further details see Chapter 161 which
discusses the laws of chatzitzah in reference to the ritual immersion of
women and these laws apply as well to the washing of hands.)
13

The water must come upon your hands through manual effort; but if
the water comes of itself, this does not constitute proper washing. If a
barrel has a spout and you remove the spout, then the following rule
applies: The water that flows out as a result of your initial effort, the
first gush of water is considered coming through manual effort; but the
water which flows afterward, is not considered flowing from manual
effort, but rather as having come of itself. Therefore, if you want to
wash your hands with water coming from the spout, you must be sure
that the first gush of water covers your entire hand. Then close the
spout and open it again for the second flow; and if you cannot estimate
this properly, you should not wash your hands in this manner, and
certainly you should not wash your hands from a cistern which has a
small spout from which a thin trickle of water flows.

14

It is forbidden to eat [bread] without washing, even if you plan to wrap
your hands in a cloth. If you are traveling and do not have water, if you
know that within four mil in the direction you are heading or a mil
behind you, you will find water, then you are required to travel within
four mil forward or within a mil backward to wash for eating. But if
even [after traveling] these distances you will not find water, or if you
are with a group, and you are afraid to be separated from them, and
similarly, if you are in any other emergency situation in which you are
unable to wash your hands, wrap your hands in a cloth, or put on
gloves, and you may eat the bread this way.




15


If you went to the lavatory before the meal so that you have to wash
your hands to recite the berachah Asher Yatzar (see Chapter 4,
paragraph 6) and you also have to wash your hands for the meal, there
are numerous questions [as to the best procedure]. Therefore, the best
thing to do is to wash your hands first in a manner that does not meet
the halachic requirements for the washing of hands before a meal, that
is: pour only a little water onto one palm and rub both hands together
with this water and dry them thoroughly. Then recite the berachah
Asher Yatzar, and afterwards wash your hands properly, fulfilling the
requirements of washing the hands before a meal, and recite the
berachah Al Netilas Yadayim.

16

If, during a meal, you touched your body in areas that are usually
covered, or scratched your head, or urinated, you must wash your
hands a second time, but do not recite the berachah. So, too, if you
moved your bowels and washed your hands during the meal you do not
recite Al Netilas Yadayim.

17

If you eat something that was dipped into a liquid, or if a liquid came
into contact with the food, and the food is still moist from the liquid,
even though you will not touch the part that is moist, nevertheless, you
are required to wash your hands first, but do not recite the berachah Al
Netilas Yadayim. Many people are lax in fulfilling this requirement. But
every God-fearing person should be stringent about it.

18

There are seven liquids, with regard to this law: wine and wine vinegar,
honey from bees, olive oil, milk and whey, dew, blood from an animal
or fowl (if eaten in permissible circumstances such as for medicinal





purposes) and water. These seven form the following acronym: Yad
shachat dam. But other fruit juices, do not have the status of liquid, in
regard to this halachah.
19

[If you are eating] fruits preserved in sugar, you do not have to wash
your hands, because sugar is not considered a liquid. Similarly, the
moisture that oozes out of the fruit is not considered liquid, rather it is
(considered as) fruit juice. But if the fruit was preserved in honey, and
the honey congealed, then it is no longer considered a liquid, and it is
considered a food and you do not have to wash your hands. But if it
did not congeal well but merely thickened a little, and the honey still
flows, you have to wash your hands. So, too, regarding butter which is
in the category of milk, if it is in a solid state, it is not considered a
liquid but rather a food, but if it is melted (in a liquid state) it is
considered a liquid.

20

Foodstuffs that are usually eaten without a spoon or fork, even when
eaten with a spoon or fork, require Netilas Yadayim (if the food was
moist as in the previous halachah). But something that is eaten only
with a spoon [or fork], for example pancakes, or puddings, or fruits
preserved in honey, where it is customary to eat them only with a spoon
or fork, you do not have to wash your hands.

21

Salt produced from water is considered in the category of water,
(Because water, even when it solidifies, does not lose the status of
water). Therefore, if you dip a radish or similar item into this salt, you
have to wash your hands. Whiskey made from grains or fruit is not
considered a liquid in this context, for it is only the vapor of the grain
or fruit. Even though it also contains some water, and it is diluted with





water, nevertheless, (water) is a minor part of it; therefore, if you dip
something into it and you wish to eat it, you do not have to wash your
hands. But whiskey made from shells or seeds of the grape or from wine
sediment, it appears to me, should be considered a liquid.
"
"1

Before eating real bread, such as that made from the five grains [wheat,
barley, oats, rye, spelt] you must recite the berachah Hamotzi and after
[eating, recite] Birkas hamazon.

2

Be careful not to interrupt [by talking] between reciting Al Netilas
Yadayim, and Hamotzi. But it is permissible to answer Amein to any
berachah that you hear. A pause lasting as long as it takes to walk
twenty-two amos [11.88 seconds], or from one house to another even if
it is a short distance, or talking about something not related to the
meal, is considered an interruption. However, if you did interrupt [in
such a fashion], it does not matter, provided you did not perform some
task in between; and did not engage in lengthy discussion, for if you
did any of the above, it would be considered a distraction and you have
to wash your hands again.

3

You should break off the bread at the choicest part of the loaf in honor
of the berachah. The choicest part is the crust or hard part, for there the
bread is baked best, and it is the part opposite the place where the bread
splits open. This occurs because at the place where it starts to bake, the
pressure on the dough builds until the opposite side splits. However, an
old person who finds it difficult to eat hard bread should cut the bread





at the soft part. In any event, cutting the bread should not cause
excessive delay between the berachah Hamotzi and eating the bread.
Therefore [before saying the berachah], make a small, circular incision
around the loaf, in a way that by holding the piece [to be cut], the
entire loaf will be lifted along with it, for otherwise it is considered cut
off, and we require that the berachah Hamotzi be said while the loaf is
whole. [Therefore] leave the piece to be cut joined to the rest of the loaf
and say the berachah Hamotzi, and after completing the berachah, you
may separate them. In this manner the berachah is concluded while the
loaf is still whole. Similarly, when breaking off a piece from a loaf which
is not whole, do not cut the slice off completely before saying Hamotzi,
so that the loaf should be as large as possible at the time of the
berachah. On Shabbos, however, do not cut into the bread at all until
after reciting the berachah, so that the loaves should be completely
whole. Also on a weekday, if you eat a thin type of bread, [such as
matzah], recite the berachah before breaking it, since there is no delay
in breaking the bread.
4

Do not cut off a small piece because you will appear miserly, on the
other hand do not cut a piece larger than the size of an egg because you
will appear gluttonous. This applies only if you are eating alone, but if
you are eating with a group of people, and you must give from the
piece you cut a kazayis to each of them, you may cut off as much as you
need. On Shabbos, even if you eat alone, you may cut off as much as
you need for the entire meal, in honor of the Shabbos. You indicate
your fondness for the Shabbos meal, by your desire to eat generously of
the food. You should eat the piece that you cut off before eating any
other bread, to show your fondness for this mitzvah, since you recited





the berachah over this piece. It is also preferable not to give from this
piece to a non-Jew or an animal or fowl.
5

Before reciting the berachah, place both hands on the bread because the
ten fingers are symbolic of the ten mitzvos involved in making bread.
[The ten are] 1. It is forbidden to plow with a team comprised of an ox
and a donkey. 2. It is forbidden to plant diverse species together. 3. The
stalks that fall during harvesting must be left for the poor. 4. A sheaf
forgotten in the field must be left for the poor. 5. A corner of the field
must be left unharvested for the poor. 6. It is forbidden to muzzle a
working animal. 7. A portion of grain must be separated and given to
the kohein (priestly family). 8. A tenth of the remaining harvest must be
given to the Levite. 9. A tenth of the remaining harvest is then
separated to be taken up to Jerusalem and eaten by the owner. 10. A
piece of the dough is separated and given to the kohein. For this same
reason there are ten words in the berachah of Hamotzi, and ten words
in the verse (Psalms 145:15 ): ""The eyes of all look expectantly to You""
etc., and ten words in the verse (Deuteronomy 8:8 ): ""A land of wheat
and barley"" etc., and ten words in the verse (Genesis 27:28 ): ""And may
Hashem give you"" etc. When you pronounce the Name of Hashem, lift
up the bread. On Shabbos lift up both loaves, and recite the berachah
with concentration, making sure to enunciate clearly the letter hei in
the word Hamotzi. Also allow a short pause between saying the word
lechem and the word min, so as not to slur over the letter mem. After
reciting the berachah, you must immediately eat the bread, because it is
forbidden to interrupt between saying the berachah and eating [the
bread], even to answer Amein. You should try to eat a kazayis of bread
without interruption.




6


It is a mitzvah to have salt on the table before breaking the bread and to
dip the piece of bread over which Hamotzi was said, into the salt. The
reason for this is that the table is compared to the Altar [in the Holy
Temple] and the food symbolizes the offering, and it is said (Leviticus
2:13 ): ""On all your offerings you shall offer salt."" And because the table

is compared to the Altar, it is best to take care not to kill any vermin [or
other insects] on it.
7

When you distribute portions of bread to others at the table, do not
throw them, for it is forbidden to throw bread. And also do not hand it
directly into the other person's hand, but, rather, place it in front of
him.

8

It is best to say Hamotzi on the choicest bread possible. Therefore, if
you have before you a piece of bread and a whole loaf, and you plan on
eating from both of them during the meal, and both are from the same
grain, even if the whole loaf is smaller than the piece of bread, and not
as pure as the piece of bread, nevertheless, [say the berachah] and break
the whole one, because it is the choicest. But if they are not from the
same grain, and the whole one is of inferior quality, for example, if the
whole loaf is made from spelt, and the cut piece is made from wheat,
even if the piece is smaller than the loaf, you should say the berachah
on the piece made from wheat. If, however, the whole loaf is made from
barley, even though it is inferior to wheat, nevertheless, since barley is
also clearly mentioned in the Torah, and since the loaf is a whole one, a
God-fearing person should show respect also to the whole barley loaf.
How can you accomplish this? Place the cut piece underneath the
whole loaf [and say the berachah] and break off from both at the same





time. If both of them are whole or both are already sliced and both are
made from the same grain, say the berachah on the purest of the two. If
both are equally pure, say the berachah on the larger of the two pieces.
9

If you have before you bread made by a Jew and bread made by a nonJew, and you are not stringent about eating bread from a non-Jew—If
both of them are whole loaves, or both of them are pieces of equal size,
and they are made from the same grain, you should recite the berachah
over the bread made by the Jew. But if the bread made by the Jew is not
as pure as the one made by the non-Jew then recite the berachah on
whichever one you wish. If the host is stringent not to eat bread made
by a non-Jew but it was brought to the table for the sake of a guest, it
should be removed from the table until after the berachah of Hamotzi is
said.

10

All the above laws concerning the order of preference apply only if your
intention is to eat from both of them during the meal. But if you
intend to eat from only one of the breads during the meal, cut from the
one you wish to eat, and you need not be concerned about which is the
choicest.
"
"1

If you own animals or birds (poultry), and it is your responsibility to
feed them, you are not allowed to eat anything until you feed them, as
it is written (Deuteronomy 11:15 ): ""And I will put grass in your fields
for your cattle (animals) and you will eat and be satisfied."" Thus the
Torah has given preference to feeding the cattle [animals] before the
feeding of man. But as regards drinking, man comes first as it is written





(Genesis 24:14 ): [Rivkah said] ""Drink first and I will also give your
camels to drink."" Similarly it is written (Numbers 20:8 ): ""And you will
give drink to the congregation and to their animals.""
2

Do not eat or drink in a gluttonous way. Do not eat while standing and
do not drink while standing; and your table should be clean and nicely
covered, even if you are only going to eat something insignificant. Do
not take a portion as large as a kebeitzah and eat from it; and do not
hold the food in one hand and break off pieces from it with the other
hand. Do not drink a cup of wine in one gulp, and one who does so is a
glutton. Drinking it in two gulps, is considered proper; but drinking it
in three gulps is considered haughtiness, unless, it is a very large cup,
for then you can drink from it many times. Similarly, if it is a very small
cup [containing less than a revi'is], you can drink it in one gulp.

3

Do not take a bite of bread and place the remainder on the table, or
give it to a friend, or put it into the serving dish, because it might be
offensive to others. Also, do not drink from a cup and give the rest to a
friend, because every person should be careful not to drink from the
remainder of a cup from which someone else has drank, for the one to
whom it is offered might be embarrassed and drink from it against his
will.

4

Do not be irritable during the meal because the guests and the family
members will be embarrassed to eat, for they may think that you are
angry and irritable because you begrudge them their food.

5

Do not talk while eating, even about matters of Torah, because there is
a danger of choking, should the food enter the windpipe instead of the





gullet. Even if someone sneezes, you should not say gezuntheit to him.
But when you are not actually eating, it is a mitzvah to discuss Torah
matters at the table, and you should be very careful to observe this rule.
It is also a good custom to say, after eating the piece of bread of the
motzi, [Psalm 23 which begins]:""A Psalm to David Hashem is my
shepherd I shall lack nothing,"" for these are considered [words of ]
Torah, as well as a prayer for food. At the conclusion of the meal, if it is
a weekday, it is customary to say (Psalm 137 ): ""By the rivers of
Babylon."" On Shabbos and Yom Tov and on all days when tachanun is
not said, it is customary to say (Psalm 126 ): ""A song of Ascents, when
Hashem brings about the return to Zion."" When learning at the table
from a book, be very careful, because it is very common [particularly
with the old type of paper] for the books to harbor small worms, and
you might transgress the prohibition against eating them, God forbid.
6

If two are sitting at a table together, even if each has his own dish, or if
they are eating fruit and each has his own portion, nevertheless, the
more learned of the two starts eating first; and one who starts eating
before a more learned person is a glutton.

7

If two are eating from one dish and one stops eating in order to drink
something or do some minor thing, it is proper etiquette that the other
person wait for him; but if there are three eating, the two do not have
to stop eating to wait for the one.

8

You may use bread for any of your needs, provided the bread doesn't
become repulsive, but you must not cause it to become repulsive.
Therefore you must not use it to prop up a plate which contains
something that will make the bread repulsive, if it spills on it. If you eat





any kind of food with a piece of bread and you use the bread as a
substitute spoon, you must be careful to eat some of the bread with
each mouthful, and what is left from the bread should also be eaten
afterwards.
9

It is forbidden to throw bread even in a place where it will not become
repulsive, because the very act of throwing is degrading to the bread. It
is also forbidden to throw other kinds of food, which become repulsive
when thrown. But food that will not become loathsome, such as nuts,
etc., may be thrown. Do not sit on a sack that contains fruit, because
they will become repulsive by it. Do not wash your hands with wine or
other liquids, because it degrades them. When you see food lying on
the ground, you must pick it up. Food that is fit for human beings
should not be fed to animals because it degrades the food.

10

If you have to make medicine from bread or from any other food, even
though the food becomes repulsive because of it, it is permissible.

11

Be very careful not to throw crumbs away, because it may cause
poverty; rather, gather them and feed them to the birds.

12

When you drink water, you should not drink in the presence of others,
rather, turn your face away; but when drinking other liquids, you need
not turn your face away.

13

Do not stare at someone who is eating or drinking, nor at the portion
in front of him, so as not to embarrass him.

14

Some of the food or drink which has a [good] aroma and creates desire,
must be given to the waiter before it is served to others, because it can





be harmful to see food before him for which he has a desire and yet
cannot eat of it.
15

Do not serve food to anyone unless you know he will wash his hands
and recite the berachah.

16

A woman whose husband is not present, should not drink wine; and if
she is away from home, even if her husband is with her, she is
forbidden to drink wine. The same applies to other intoxicating drinks.
However, if she is accustomed to drink wine in the presence of her
husband, she may drink a little even in her husband's absence.

17

Guests must not take anything from the food served them and give it to
the son or daughter of the host, for it may be that the host has no other
food than that which has been set before them, and he will be
embarrassed if the guests will not have enough. But if there is abundant
food on the table, it is permissible.

18

When you enter a home, do not say, ""Give me something to eat,"" [but
you should wait] until it is offered. It is forbidden to partake of a meal
which is not sufficient for the hosts even if the host invites you to eat
with him because this borders on robbery. This is a serious sin, and it is
in the category of sins for which repentance is very difficult.

19

It is forbidden to leave your place before reciting Birkas Hamazon (see
Chap. 44). [It is forbidden] even to go to another room, in the middle
of the meal, to finish the meal there, or to return to the original room
to finish the meal. Even to walk out the door and return afterwards to
finish the meal, should be avoided. If, however, you do go out, whether
you finish the meal where you are presently, or you return to your





original place to finish your meal, you do not have to repeat the
berachah Hamotzi, because since the meal was set on bread, even
though you changed places, it is considered all one meal; but you must
be sure to eat at least a kazayis of bread at the place you will recite
Birkas Hamazon. However, when food other than bread is involved, the
laws are not the same.
20

If a group of people eat together and some of them leave the table with
the intention of returning, even if only one of the group remains at the
original place, there is no disruption to the status of the place they
established; and when they return, they return to their original status
and their leaving is not considered an interruption.

21

If, at the time you recited the berachah, Hamotzi, you had in mind to
go to another place to complete the meal and recite Birkas Hamazon
there, the custom is to permit this practice, but you must make sure to
eat at least a kezayis of bread at the new place. But this should not be
done unless it is necessary to attend a mitzvah repast.

22

If you interrupt the meal to pray, when you resume eating, you do not
have to repeat the Hamotzi. Similarly, if you fall asleep during the meal
for a short nap, even though it was prolonged for a while, it is not
considered an interruption. Similarly, if you interrupted for other
personal needs such as to move your bowels or the like. Nevertheless, in
these latter situations, your hands must be washed again, because of the
distraction, unless you guarded your hand from uncleanness. Even
though you wash your hands again, you do not recite the berachah on
this washing; because, when washing on account of distraction, you do
not recite another berachah.




23


When you finish your meal and you have decided to recite Birkas
Hamazon, but then change your mind and want to eat or drink, there
are numerous technical difficulties of halachah regarding the berachah
to be said. Therefore, you should refrain from this practice. Rather, as
soon as you decide to say Birkas Hamazon, you should do so.
"
"1

Everything you eat during the meal to satisfy your hunger, for example:
meat, fish, relishes, porridges, soups, pancakes etc., even if you eat them
without bread, you do not have to recite a berachah before or after
eating them; because since you are eating them to satisfy your hunger,
they are considered part of the meal, and the whole meal is secondary
to the bread which is the mainstay of life. Therefore, all such foods are
exempt with the berachah of Hamotzi and the Birkas Hamazon. Even if
food is sent to you from another house, you do not have to recite a
[separate] berachah over it, because it is assumed that your intention
[when reciting Hamotzi] was to include any food that is brought to
you.

2

Similarly, you do not have to recite a separate berachah over beverages;
because beverages are also considered part of the meal, since it is not
usual to eat [a meal] without drinking. The exception to this rule is
when you drink wine, because wine is something special. (For in many
instances, we must recite a berachah over wine, even though we do not
actually want to drink any, for example, when reciting Kiddush or
Havdallah.) Therefore, you have to recite a berachah over it, even
during the course of a meal. If you recited a berachah over the wine





before washing your hands for the meal, and you intended to drink
wine during the meal, or [even without special intention] if you are
accustomed to drink wine during the meal, you do not have to repeat
the berachah, for it is exempt with the berachah you said over the wine
before the meal. Whiskey, which in our area [Central and Eastern
Europe] is not usually consumed during a meal, is in question whether
it is part of the meal or not. Therefore, if you intend drinking whiskey
during the meal, drink a little before washing your hands, [that is] less
than a kazayis, recite the berachah over it and have in mind to exempt
that which you will drink during the meal. If you failed to do this,
recite a berachah first on a bit of sugar and thus exempt the whiskey.
There are those who resolve the problem by dipping some bread into
the whiskey, but other authorities question this practice.
3

If you wish to eat fruit during the meal without eating bread with it,
since the fruit is not an essential part of the meal, therefore, even if the
fruit was on the table before you said the Hamotzi, nevertheless, the
fruit is not exempt with the berachah of Hamotzi and you have to say a
berachah before eating the fruit. However the after-berachah over fruit
is not necessary because it will be exempt with Birkas Hamazon. If you
intend to eat the fruit with bread, you do not have to say any berachah
because the fruit is secondary to the bread. If you intend to eat some
fruit with bread and some without bread, be sure to eat the fruit
without bread first and make a berachah over the fruit, and afterwards
you can eat fruit even with the bread. But if you first eat the fruit with
bread and then eat fruit without bread, there is a question about saying
the berachah. Some people are accustomed to eat something between
courses that increases the appetite, such as pickled olives, pickled
lemons, radishes or other such relishes. These are considered part of the





meal since these relishes enable you to eat more. Therefore, you do not
have to recite a berachah [before eating these relishes] for the berachah
on the bread exempts them.
4

If the principal part of your meal consists of fruit that you (intend to)
eat with bread, since the fruit is the main part of the meal, it is exempt
with the berachah of Hamotzi, even if at the time you said the Hamotzi,
the fruit was not on the table; just be sure when you start eating the
fruit to eat some bread with it, and then, even the fruit you eat without
bread does not require a berachah.

5

If you are going to eat fruit that was cooked for a meal, as is usually
done with a side dish, whether it was cooked with meat or without
meat, you should eat some of it both at the beginning and at the end
[of the meal] with bread, and then during the meal, you may eat it even
without bread, and you do not have to recite a berachah.

6

If you eat baked goods, such as cakes, torte, mandel bread etc., (during
the meal) to satisfy your hunger, you do not have to say a berachah. But
if you eat them just for enjoyment, there is a question if a berachah is
required. Therefore it is best to have in mind when you say the Hamotzi
to exempt [with it] all these types of food.

7

If, after you finish the meal, you drink coffee in order to digest the
food, before you recite the Birkas Hamazon, you have to say a berachah
prior to drinking it, because anything eaten to help digestion is not
considered part of the meal. Nevertheless, it is best to say the berachah
of Shehakol on some sugar, and with that exempt the coffee.




"
"1

We find that many people are lenient regarding the law of washing the
hands at the end of a meal. However, it is proper for every God-fearing
person to observe this law scrupulously. You are required to wash only
up to the second knuckle, holding your hands downward before drying
them. The one leading the Birkas Hamazon should wash first.

2

Do not wash on ground where people walk, because a damaging spirit
dwells on this water, but rather wash into a vessel or under the table,
dry your hands and then recite Birkas Hamazon. There must be no
interruption between washing and Birkas Hamazon

3

Do not remove the tablecloth or bread until after Birkas Hamazon.
Bread should be on the table at the time of Birkas Hamazon to
demonstrate the abundance of goodness from Hashem, blessed be His
Name—that He gives us enough to eat and to spare, as Elisha [the
prophet] said to his servant: ""For so said Hashem, eat and leave over.""
Another reason for this custom is that Hashem's blessing has no effect
on a void. It is only effective on some existing substance, as Elisha said
to the wife of Ovadiah: ""What do you have in the house?"" [which I can
bless.]

4

It is customary to remove all the knives from the table before Birkas
Hamazon or to cover them, because the table is like the Altar [of the
Bais Hamikdash] and concerning the Altar it is said: ""Do not lift up any
iron upon them."" Since metal shortens human life [in the form of
weapons] and the Altar prolongs human life, it is improper that





something that shortens life be lifted above that which lengthens life.
Similarly the table prolongs the days of man, and atones for his sins
when needy guests are invited to the table, for the power of hospitality
is so great that it causes the Divine Spirit to dwell in our midst. It is
customary in many places not to cover the knives on Shabbos and Yom
Tov; for on weekdays we cover them because they represent the power
of Esau, but on Shabbos and Yom Tov the forces of evil do not prevail,
and a custom of Israel has the validity of Torah.
5

Even if you only eat a kazayis of bread, you have to recite Birkas
Hamazon.

6

You must not recite Birkas Hamazon while standing or walking, but
only while sitting. Even if you were walking around the house while
eating or you were standing or reclining, when you recite Birkas
Hamazon, you should sit in order to concentrate properly. You must
not even recline, for that is a form of haughtiness, but you should sit
erect. You should put on your jacket, and your hat, so that the fear of
heaven be upon you. You should arouse your concentration and recite
Birkas Hamazon with reverence and awe. You must not engage in any
other activity while reciting Birkas Hamazon.

7

It is customary that the listeners answer Amein, after the phrases
beginning with Harachamon, which are said [at the end of ] Birkas
Hamazon. Because the Midrash teaches us that when you hear someone
reciting a prayer, or blessing another Jew, even without mentioning the
Name of Hashem, you should respond with Amein.




8


If you neglected to recite Birkas Hamazon, until the food was digested,
that is when you begin to feel hungry, you can no longer recite Birkas
Hamazon. Some are of the opinion that this time span is one and a fifth
hours [seventy-two minutes]. Nevertheless, at elaborate meals, the time
people take between eating and Birkas Hamazon is longer than this
time limit because even during this interim, people usually drink and
eat desserts. The best thing, however, is not to delay Birkas Hamazon
too long.

9

If you left your place before reciting Birkas Hamazon, then, if there is a
piece of bread at the new place, eat it there and you need not recite the
Hamotzi before eating it. You need only recite Birkas Hamazon
afterwards. If there is no bread there, you must return to the original
place to recite Birkas Hamazon. If you are so far away, that until you
return to your original place, the time limit will have elapsed, then
recite Birkas Hamazon where you are.

10

On a Shabbos which is also Rosh Chodesh or a Yom Tov or the
intermediate days of a holiday, first recite Retzei and then say Ya'aleh
Veyavo. The reason for this is that Shabbos occurs regularly and is more
sacred than the others [Rosh Chodesh or Yom Tov.]

11

If you forgot or are uncertain whether you said Birkas Hamazon, then if
you ate enough to be satisfied (for which the reciting of Birkas
Hamazon is Biblically mandated), you must say Birkas Hamazon again.
Similarly, if you fall asleep while reciting Birkas Hamazon and when
you awaken you do not know where you were up to [before falling
asleep], you must start from the beginning of Birkas Hamazon. In the





case of a woman who is uncertain whether she recited Birkas Hamazon
or not, she does not have to recite it.
12

If you forgot to say Retzei on Shabbos, or Ya'aleh Veyavo on Yom Tov, if
you remember before you said Hashem's Name of the berachah
""Baruch ata Hashem Boneh Berachamav Yerushalayim,"" then you may
recite Retzei or Ya'aleh Veyavo and start again from Uvenei Yerushalayim.
But if you did not remember until after you said Hashem's Name,
finish the berachah of Boneh Berachamav Yerushalayim Amein, and there
[before starting the fourth berachah] on the Shabbos say the following:
""Blessed are you Hashem, our God, King of the Universe, Who gave
the Shabbos for rest to His people Yisroel with love, for a sign and a
covenant. Blessed are you, Hashem, Sanctifier of the Shabbos."" On
Yom Tov, if you forgot Ya'aleh Veyavo, you should say the following:
""Blessed are You, Hashem, our God, King of the universe, Who gave
Festivals to His people Yisroel for happiness and joy, this day of (name
of festival). Blessed are You, Hashem, Sanctifier of Yisroel and the
seasons."" If a festival occurs on a Shabbos and you forgot to say Retzei
and Ya'aleh Veyavo, you should say the following: ""Blessed are You,
Hashem, our God, King of the universe, Who gave Shabbosos for rest
to His people Yisroel with love, for a sign and a covenant, and Festivals
for happiness and joy, this day of (name of festival.) Blessed are You,
Hashem, Sanctifier of the Shabbos, Yisroel, and the seasons."" If on a
Shabbos and Yom Tov, you said Retzei but did not say Ya'aleh Veyavo,
say the berachah as if it were only Yom Tov. If in this situation you said
Ya'aleh Veyavo and did not say Retzei say what you would if it were just
Shabbos.




13


If you did not remember until you already started the fourth berachah
which begins: ""Blessed are you, Hashem … Our God, King of the
universe. Almighty, our Father,"" even if you only said the word Baruch
[Blessed], you cannot correct the omission by saying the berachah
'Who gave'; therefore, if this occurs during the first two Shabbos meals
you [must] repeat from the beginning of Birkas Hamazon. If all you
have said was: ""Blessed are you, Hashem"" [of the fourth blessing],
conclude by saying lamedeini chukecha so that God's name is not said in
vain and then repeat from the beginning of Birkas Hamazon. But if this
occurs at the third meal at which even on Shabbos we are not required
to eat bread and certainly on Yom Tov, and Birkas Hamazon is thus not
a requirement of the day, therefore you need not repeat from the
beginning, but continue and complete saying Birkas Hamazon. But if
you remember at a point where you can still correct the omission [by
saying] the berachah Asher Nasan [Who gave]…, you must correct the
error, even if it happens after you ate a number of meals.

14

If you forgot on Rosh Chodesh, and did not say Ya'aleh Veyavo, you
should say the following: ""Blessed are You, Hashem, King of the
universe, Who gave Rosh Chodesh days to His people Yisroel for
remembrance,"" and you do not say an after-berachah. (It does not
matter whether this happened during the day or night of Rosh Chodesh.)
If during the intermediate days of Yom Tov, you did not say Ya'aleh
Veyavo, you should say the following: ""Blessed are You, Hashem, Our
God, King of the universe, who gave Festivals to His people Yisroel for
happiness and joy. This day of (name of festival). Blessed are You,
Hashem, Sanctifier of Yisroel and the Seasons."" If this should occur on
Rosh Hashanah, you should say the following: ""Blessed are You,





Hashem, our God, King of the universe, Who gave Festivals to His
people Yisroel for remembrance. Blessed are You Hashem, Sanctifier of
Yisroel and the Day of Remembrance."" And if you did not remember
[that you forgot Ya'aleh Veyavo] until after starting the next berachah,
you need not repeat from the beginning, for on Rosh Chodesh and the
intermediate days of Yom Tov and on Rosh Hashanah, you are not
specifically required to eat bread.
15

If Rosh Chodesh occurs on a Shabbos and you forgot to say Retzei and
Ya'aleh Veyavo and you remember and say: Blessed are You, Hashem,
Our God, King of the Universe, Asher Nasan, Who gave, then you
should also mention Rosh Chodesh both at the beginning and at the
end, and say the following: ""Who gave Shabbosos for rest to His people
Yisroel with love for a sign and a covenant; and Rosh Chodesh days for
remembrance. Blessed are You, Hashem, Sanctifier of the Shabbos,
Yisroel, and Rosh Chodesh."" Even though, had it been only Rosh
Chodesh, there would be no after-berachah, in this instance, since there
is an after-berachah because of Shabbos, you mention Rosh Chodesh too.
If, however, you said Retzei, but forgot Ya'aleh Veyavo and became aware
of the omission only after the beginning of the next berachah, you need
not repeat from the beginning, for you already mentioned Shabbos and
for the sake of Rosh chodesh you need not repeat Birkas Hamazon. If in
this situation you said Ya'aleh Veyavo but forgot Retzei and therefore
must repeat Birkas Hamazon, then you have to say Ya'aleh Veyavo again.
The same would apply if it were Shabbos on an intermediate day of
Yom Tov or on Rosh Hashanah.

16

On Chanukah and Purim, if you forgot to say Al hanissim, and you did
not remember until after you said Hashem's Name, at the conclusion of





the berachah [Nodeh], you need not repeat Birkas Hamazon; but while
reciting the Harachaman; you should say: ""The all merciful One—may
He perform for us miracles and wonders as He did to our forefathers in
those days at this time in the days of Mattisyahu etc. or in the days of
Mordechai etc.""
17

If you are eating on Shabbos and it became dark, since you have not yet
prayed the evening prayers, you still say Retzei. Likewise on Yom Tov,
Rosh Chodesh, Chanukah and Purim, since the beginning of the meal
was during the day, we must mention that which is related to the day
even if the Birkas Hamazon is recited at night. If you ate on the eve of
Rosh Chodesh and your meal was prolonged into the night, if after it was
dark you also ate a kazayis of bread, you must say Ya'aleh Ve'yavo. The
same applies to Chanukah and Purim. If you began eating a Shabbos
meal, and the meal was prolonged into the night and you also ate a
kazayis at night, and the next day is Rosh Chodesh say Retzei and Ya'aleh
Veyavo. The same applies to Chanukah and Purim. There are some who
argue this point because they consider it to be self-contradictory [it
cannot be both day and night]. It is therefore best to avoid continuing
the meal into the night.

18

If there is a non-Jew in the house when you are reciting Birkas
Hamazon, you should say: [in the Harachaman] ""We, the members of
the covenant, all of us together.""
"
"1

Three men who have eaten together should recite Birkas Hamazon with
Zimun, and it is a mitzvah to recite it over a cup of wine if possible. If





wine is not available, beer, 'mead' or whiskey may be used, if they are
common beverages of the locality. This is true in an area where
grapevines do not grow within a day's distance from the city, and as a
result, wine is expensive and therefore these other beverages are used
instead of wine. Some authorities hold that even an individual reciting
Birkas Hamazon should do so over a cup. It is the custom of those who
are meticulous, when reciting Birkas Hamazon individually not to lift
up the cup, but rather to place it on the table in front of them.
2

The cup is filled first and then the hands are washed.

3

If you drink some of the wine out of a cup whatever remains in it
becomes blemished and is disqualified for use for Birkas Hamazon
unless it is rectified by adding a little wine or water that is not
blemished. Since the cup must be filled specifically for the sake of
reciting a berachah, therefore, if the cup was blemished and you
rectified it, you must pour it back into the bottle and from the bottle
back into the cup for the sake of the berachah.

4

The cup used for the berachah must be whole, and even if the bottom
base is broken, it is disqualified. Even the slightest notch in the rim of
the cup or a crack in the cup disqualifies it. The cup must be rinsed
from inside and washed from outside, or [if water is unavailable] it
must be wiped clean. The beverage must be poured from the bottle for
the purpose of reciting the berachah and the cup must be full. The one
who leads the Birkas Hamazon should accept the cup in both hands to
show his affection for the cup in that he longs to accept it with all his
might as it is written: ""Lift up your hands to the sanctuary and bless
Hashem."" He then removes his left hand and holds it only with his





right hand without any help of the left (so it should not appear as a
burden to him.) He should look at the cup so that he is not distracted,
and he should hold it a tefach above the table, as it is written: ""The cup
of deliverance I will raise and upon the Name, Hashem, I will call."" A
left handed person should hold the cup in his ""right"" hand which is
everyone else's left. It is proper to remove the empty dishes from the
table [before Birkas Hamazon.]
5

If all those who are part of the group are of equal status and there is a
kohein among the group it is a mitzvah to honor him with leading the
Birkas Hamazon, as it is said: ""You should sanctify him."" But if there is
a great Torah scholar in the group, he should lead the Birkas Hamazon.
It is customary to have a mourner lead the Birkas Hamazon. This
applies only when they are of equal status. It is also proper to honor
with the leading of Birkas Hamazon, one who is generous, who despises
illegal profits, and dispenses charity with his money, as it is written:
""One who is generous shall be blessed."" Do not read yevorach—""shall
be blessed,"" but, rather, yevareich—""shall bless.""

6

He who leads the Birkas Hamazon should begin by saying: ""Come let
us say the blessings,"" because all holy things require prior preparation.
(He may also say in the Yiddish language Rabbosai, mir villen bentshen.)
The rest of the assembled respond: Yehi sheim Hashem mevorach mei'ata
ve'ad olam [Let the name of Hashem be blessed from now forever.]
Then the leader says: Birshus maranan verabbanan verabbosai [With
your permission, distinguished gentlemen] nevareich she'achalnu mishelo
[Let us bless Him of whose bounty we have eaten] and the assembled
respond baruch she'achalnu mishelo uvetuvo chayinu [Blessed is He of
Whose bounty we have eaten and through whose goodness we live.]





Then the leader repeats it and he also says: Baruch she'achalnu mishelo
uvetuvo chayinu [Blessed is He of whose bounty we have eaten and
through whose goodness we live.] In some communities the custom is
that after the leader concludes uvetuvo chayinu: [And through Whose
goodness we live,] the assembled respond Amein. In other communities,
however, it is not the custom to respond Amein. There are also various
customs in reference to saying: Baruch hu uvaruch shemo [Blessed is He
and blessed is his Name.] Some have the custom that the leader says it
[even] where only three men are present; whereas, others hold that it
should not be said unless there are ten men present, because then
Hashem's Name is mentioned, and it may be said. This is the proper
custom. The assembled should not say it, and, certainly, one who
recites Birkas Hamazon without zimun should not say it.
7

The leader should say the Birkas Hamazon aloud and the assembled,
should quietly repeat every word with him and at the end of each
berachah they should hasten to finish [their berachah] before the leader
so that they may respond Amein to his berachah.

8

After Birkas Hamazon the leader makes a berachah on the cup over
which he said Birkas Hamazon and drinks a revi'is from it, so that he
may recite the after-berachah [over the wine]. If the [contents of ] cups
of those assembled have become blemished, the leader should pour
some of his [wine] into their cups after he recites the berachah Borei
peri hagafen, [but]before he drinks from it, so that they, too, may say a
berachah over cups that are not blemished. Similarly, if their cups are
empty, he should, likewise, pour into them a little from the cup over
which the berachah was said, but they should not taste of it until he
who said the berachah tastes of it. But, if each of them have their own





cups which are not blemished, the leader need not give them from his
cup and they may taste of theirs before he tastes of his. If possible, the
proper way [of doing it] is that each one should have a full cup.
9

If the leader does not wish to drink from the cup, some authorities hold
that he may give it to one of the other assembled guests to recite the
blessing Borei peri hagafen and drink a revi'is and recite the concluding
berachah. Other authorities hold that this should not be done, rather,
the one who leads the Zimun should recite the berachah over the cup,
and this is the proper way.

10

If two men eat together it is a mitzvah for them to seek a third to join
them for a Zimun. If the third person came after the two have already
finished eating, and some additional food were brought to them as a
dessert and they would eat it, then it is a mitzvah for them to invite this
third person for zimun. They should give him a kazayis of food for
which he would be required to recite a concluding berachah, and then
he can join them for Zimun. Some authorities hold that the third
person must eat bread; and others hold that any kind of grain food
suffices. There are even those who hold that fruit and vegetables are
sufficient; and still others who hold even if he does not eat [food], but
merely drinks a revi'is of any kind of beverage except water, he may join
them for Zimun, and this is the accepted practice. And though he
didn't eat, but only drank, he can still say ""[Blessed is He from whose
bounty] we have eaten"" since drinking is included in the category of
eating. After the berachah Hazan es hakkol, [Who nourishes all] he [the
third person] should recite the concluding berachah over what he ate or
drank; [however] if the third person arrived after the other two already





washed their hands with the water that concludes [the meal], he can no
longer join them.
11

If three men eat together, since they are required to form a Zimun, they
are not allowed to separate. The same applies when four or five people
eat together, not even one of them is allowed to recite Birkas Hamazon
privately, because all of them are obligated in this Zimun. If the group
consists of six or more but less than ten, they may separate in such a
manner that there remains a Zimun for each group.

12

If ten men eat together they must add Hashem's Name [to the Zimun];
that is, the leader says: Nevareich Elokeinu [Let us bless our God]
she'achalnu mishelo [of whose bounty we have eaten], but he should not
say: nevareich Leilokeinu [Let us say a blessing to our God]; and the
assembled respond: Baruch Elokeinu she'achalnu mishelo [Blessed is our
God of whose bounty we have eaten.] Since they must recite Zimun
with Hashem's Name, they are forbidden to separate unless there are
twenty or more; then they may separate in such manner that each
group remains with enough to have Zimun with Hashem's Name.

13

If the leader of the Zimun of ten errs, and the respondents erred as well
and forgot to say the Name of Hashem as part of the Zimun, they
cannot repeat the Zimun with Hashem's Name, since they already
fulfilled their obligation of Zimun, except that they negated the mitzvah
of mentioning Hashem's Name, which is an error that cannot be
corrected. But if the respondents have not yet responded, since they
have not yet fulfilled the obligation of Zimun, the leader should repeat
the Zimun and include Hashem's Name.




14


If seven men ate bread and three ate fruit or drank beverages in
sufficient amounts to obligate them to make an after-berachah, they
may recite Zimun with Hashem's Name. (In this case everyone agrees
that it is sufficient even if some had only fruit or drink). It is a mitzvah
to look for ten men in order to recite Hashem's Name. However, if
only six ate bread, they cannot recite Zimun with Hashem's Name,
because a substantial majority is required.

15

As long as men eat together, even if they don't eat the whole meal
together but they sat down to eat together and recited the berachah
Hamotzi, even if each one of them ate from his own loaf, since they
established themselves together, whether three or ten, they are not
permitted to separate. Even if one of them wants to finish his meal
before the others, they are not permitted to separate. But if they did not
establish themselves from the beginning of the meal, rather after two of
them ate, even if they ate only a kazayis and a third person came and
joined them, if he finishes his meal with them, they are all required to
recite the Zimun. But if the third person wants to finish his meal before
them, since he did not start with them or finish with them, he is
permitted to separate from them and recite Birkas Hamazon privately.
Nevertheless, it is a mitzvah to wait in order to recite the Zimun. If
there are extenuating circumstances or he fears the possibility of
incurring a loss, even if he joined them at the beginning of the meal, he
may finish his meal before the others and recite Birkas Hamazon
privately. But if the need is not urgent, he must wait for the group.

16

If three men ate together and one of them forgot and recited Birkas
Hamazon privately, they may still recite the Zimun even after he finishes





reciting Birkas Hamazon. And he may also respond Baruch she'achalnu,
but if this third person had already joined the Zimun with two others,
he can no longer join with the first group for Zimun. If two of the three
recited Birkas Hamazon, even privately, the Zimun is defunct.
17

If three men ate together and two finished their meal and want to say
Birkas Hamazon, and one of them has not yet finished his meal and
does not want to say Birkas Hamazon, he, nevertheless, must interrupt
his meal so they may say Birkas Hamazon with Zimun. He should
answer with them and fulfill his obligation of Zimun. He should wait
until the leader concludes the berachah Hazan es hakkol, and then
resume his meal. He does not have to recite another berachah before
eating since it was his intention to continue eating. After finishing his
meal, he should say Birkas Hamazon privately. But two people need not
interrupt their meal for the sake of one, unless they wish to do so in his
honor, [as an act] beyond the letter of the law. If ten men ate together,
four must interrupt their meal for the sake of six because they are the
majority. But they need only wait until the leader says: Baruch Elokeinu
[Blessed is our God.] After they finish their own meal, they should
form their own Zimun without mentioning Hashem's Name.

18

At larger banquets where there are many guests, it is proper to choose
someone to lead Birkas Hamazon who has a powerful voice so that all
the assembled can hear the leader recite at least until after the berachah,
Hazan es Hakkol. If that is impossible, they should recite Birkas
Hamazon in smaller groups of ten.

19

Two groups that eat in one house or in two houses, if part of each
group see one another, they may join to form a Zimun. If they cannot





see each other, each group forms their own Zimun. If there is one waiter
for both groups, he is the means of joining them, provided they
originally came with the intention of combining into one group.
Whenever two groups join, they must all be able to hear the leader
recite at least until after the berachah Hazan es hakkol.
20

If you are with a group that is saying Zimun and you did not eat or
drink with them, when you hear the leader say, Nevareich she'achalnu
mishelo [Blessed is He from whose bounty we have eaten] you should
respond, Baruch umevorach shemo [Blessed is His Name] tamid le'olam
va'ed [forever and ever]. If it is a Zimun of ten and the leader, therefore,
says: Nevareich Elokeinu [Let us bless Our God], you should also
respond: Baruch Elokeinu [Blessed is our God] umevorach shemo [and
blessed is his Name] tamid le'olam va'ed [forever and ever.] If you arrive
after the leader has already said Nevareich [Let us bless, etc.], and you
hear the respondents saying: Baruch she'achalnu [Blessed is He, etc.], or
Baruch Elokeinu she'achalnu [Blessed is our God, etc.], you should
[only] say Amein.

21

If three men ate together, each from his own bread, and one of them ate
bread of a non-Jew, and the other two are careful not to eat bread of a
non-Jew, nevertheless, they can combine for Zimun. The leader should
be the one who ate the non-Jewish bread, because he can eat together
with the others. If one ate dairy foods and two ate meat, they may
combine, and the leader should be the one who ate dairy foods, because
he may eat with the others. But if the one who ate dairy foods doesn't
drink wine or if all that is available is beer which is chadash, and he is
careful not to eat chadash, then it is better for the leader of the Zimun
to be one of those who ate meat, and have Birkas Hamazon said over a





cup [of beverage] rather than to recite it without a cup. If one person
ate hard cheese and the other two ate meat, some authorities hold they
cannot combine into one group, while others hold that they may
combine, since they could all eat from the same loaf of bread. We may
accept the lenient opinion in this matter.
22

If women ate together with men who were obligated in Zimun, they,
too, are required to say Zimun and they must listen to the saying of
Zimun. In reference to a 'minor,' it is customary not to include him for
Zimun until he is thirteen years and one day old. Then he can join and
even lead the Zimun, even though it was not ascertained that he has
grown two pubic hairs. [This is a necessary requisite if one is to be
considered an adult according to halachah.]

23

If someone does not recite the Shema morning and evening, or one who
publicly violates the mitzvos, cannot be counted for Zimun. A true
convert may be counted for Zimun and he may lead and say: ""For your
parceling out as a heritage to our fathers"" because it is written about
our father, Abraham, ""A father to many nations have I made you."" And
our Rabbis explain: ""In the past you were merely a father to Aram, but
from now on [you are a father] of all nations.
"

The blood found in eggs is forbidden, and occasionally, it is forbidden
to eat the entire egg. Therefore, when using eggs in any food, the eggs
must be examined [for blood spots].




2


Blood of fish is permitted; nevertheless, if it is collected into a utensil, it
is forbidden because of the appearance of wrongdoing. However, if it is
obvious that it is blood of fish, for example, when it contains scales, it is
permitted.

3

If you bit into some bread or similar food and blood flows from your
gums onto the bread, you must cut off the part with the blood and
throw it away. However, the blood that is still between your teeth may
be sucked in if it is a weekday, since it did not leave your mouth. (But
you may not do this on Shabbos. [see Chap. 80 parag. 54])

4

Occasionally, blood is found in milk, when blood is drawn with the
milk from the udder of the cow. [When this occurs,] a Rabbinic
authority must be consulted.

5

A mixture of meat and milk is forbidden to be eaten or to be cooked.
Any benefit from this mixture is [also] forbidden. Therefore, if
something becomes forbidden due to a mixture of meat and milk, a
Rabbinic authority must be consulted about what should be done with
the mixture for sometimes it is forbidden even to derive benefit from it
and sometimes, deriving benefit is not forbidden.

6

Two Jews who know each other, even though they are critical of each
other, are forbidden to eat at the same table, if one [eats] meat and the
other dairy food, unless they make a noticeable mark between them.
For instance, each one should eat on his own tablecloth or they may
place, on the table between the foods, an article that generally does not
belong there. They must also be careful not to drink from the same
cup, because food clings to the cup.




7


And certainly they must be careful not to use the same loaf of bread for
meat and dairy meals. It is also customary to designate separate saltdishes, one for meat and one for dairy foods, because sometimes the
[food] is dipped into the salt and bits of food are left in the salt.

8

It is customary to mark knives that are used for dairy foods, as well as
other dairy dishes so they are not interchanged [with meat utensils].

9

If you ate meat or even a dish prepared with meat you may not eat
dairy food for six hours. If you chew meat for a child, you must also
wait [six hours]. Even after waiting six hours, if you find a particle of
meat between your teeth, you must remove it, but you do not have to
wait after that, all you need do is cleanse your mouth and rinse it; that
is, eat a little bread and cleanse your mouth with it, and then rinse
[your mouth] with water or another liquid.

10

If the food you ate did not contain meat nor the fat of meat, but was
merely cooked in a pot used for cooking meat, even if the pot was not
cleaned out well, it is permissible to eat dairy foods afterward.

11

After eating cheese you are permitted to eat meat immediately
thereafter at another meal, as long as you examine your hands to make
sure that no particles of cheese cling to them; or you may wash them
with water. You must also brush your teeth and rinse your mouth. But
if the cheese was hard, i.e. cheese which was aged for six months or
which was moldy, if you wish to eat meat afterwards you must also wait
six hours.




12


If after eating cheese you want to eat meat, you must remove from the
table the rest of the bread which you ate with the cheese. It is forbidden
to eat cheese on a tablecloth used for meat, and vice versa. It is also
forbidden to use a meat knife to cut bread that will be eaten with
cheese, and vice versa, even if the knife is clean. However, if there are
extenuating circumstances; for example, if you are traveling, you are
permitted [to cut bread] with a meat knife if it is clean and wiped very
well, and it is permitted to eat [the bread] with cheese, and vice versa.

13

If, however, you use a meat knife to cut onions or any other pungent
things and you put them into a dairy food, or vice versa you must
consult a Rabbinic authority.

14

If you make a meat dish using a milk substitute made from almonds
you must leave [whole] almonds in it in order to avoid the appearance
of wrongdoing.

15

It is the accepted custom not to kosher dairy utensils or dishes in order
to use them with meat, or vice versa.

16

Wine, meat or a piece of fish that does not have a distinguishing mark
that you entrust or send with a non-Jewish messenger, and certainly if
you send it with a non-observant Jew, must have a double seal. But
boiled wine, wine vinegar, or milk, bread and, cheese, need only one
seal.

17

If you send or entrust any of these items in a sack, it is necessary that
the stitches of the sack be on the inside so that it can be tied and sealed.




18


If you sent a slaughtered animal or fowl or anything else without a seal
[on the package] with a non-Jew, you should consult a Rabbinic
authority.

19

It is forbidden to eat cheeses or other items that are in the possession of
a non-Jew, although they are sealed or stamped stating that they are
kosher, as long as it is not known who sealed them.

20

Care must be taken not to cook or roast your food and the food of a
non-Jew when the two pots are next to each other, one pot containing
kosher meat and one pot treife meat, if the pots or the pans are
uncovered. Care must also be taken not to leave any pots in the care of
non-Jewish maids when there is no Jew in the house [or when there is
no Jew] going in and out of the house.

21

It is forbidden to buy wine or any other doubtful food from someone
who is not recognized as an acknowledged keeper of kashrus. However,
if you are his house guest, you may eat with him as long as you are not
certain that there is reason for suspicion.

22

Care must be taken not to leave culinary utensils in the house of a nonJew lest he make use of them. Even when you give such utensils to a
non-Jewish craftsman to be repaired, if you suspect that he used it, you
should consult a Rabbinic authority.

23

Occasionally people buy a live fowl with its legs trussed, and they throw
it to the ground and then have it slaughtered. This practice is strictly
forbidden because an animal or a chicken which fell to the ground
must not be eaten until it is observed afterwards, walking four amohs in





a normal manner. Concerning lambs or calves also, it is well to be
extremely careful in this regard.
24

During the summer it is very common for ducks to develop small
blisters like warts in their intestines and many become treife because of
them. Therefore great care must be taken to examine the intestines, and
if such small blisters are found, a Rabbinic authority must be consulted.

25

It is not permitted to knead dough with milk lest it be eaten with meat,
and it you did knead it, it is forbidden [to eat] the entire bread even by
itself, because of the Rabbinic interdiction lest it be eaten with meats.
If, however, it was a small quantity, sufficient only for one meal, or if
the bread has been shaped so that it is noticeable that it is not to be
eaten with meat, then it is permissible. The same halachah applies if
dough was kneaded with animal fat. No type of bread should be baked
with [meat or dairy] knishes in one oven [at the same time] for we are
afraid that some of the butter or some fat will flow under the bread;
and if it did flow underneath the same halachah applies as though it
were kneaded together, and the bread may not be eaten even by itself.

26

If bread was baked together with a roast, in the same oven, and the
oven was closed and the roast was uncovered it is forbidden to eat the
bread with dairy foods. However, if the roast was covered or the oven
was open and the oven is as large as ours, the bread is permitted.
Nevertheless, initially, care should be taken not to roast meat in an oven
in which bread is being baked, for fear that some fat will flow under the
bread; and even if the roast is in a pan, there is room for concern.




27


If animal fat or milk overflowed on the floor of an oven, the oven must
be cleansed by glowing heat in accordance with halachah, that is to say,
glowing coals must be spread over the whole floor of the oven until it
becomes white hot.

28

Castrated chickens may be eaten because we rely on the presumption
that the non-Jewish castrator is an expert and in sewing up the chicken
did not cause any defect to the intestines. However, if any defect is
found, even if it is merely that the intestines do not lay in the normal
position, it is forbidden to eat them.

29

In some communities, it is the practice of non-Jews who raise geese for
sale to Jews to stab them under the wings with a needle, or similar
sharp object, so that the flesh becomes swollen and the geese look fat. A
Rabbinic authority should be consulted if they are kosher or not. It also
happens when an animals is overfed and becomes critically ill, that it
was cured by striking it with an awl opposite its stomach. This
procedure also raises a question for a Rabbinic authority to decide
whether such an animal is kosher.

30

In preserving fruit it is customary to place the fruit in a jar and to cover
the mouth of the jar and tie it with the bladder skin of an animal. It is
then placed into a hot oven so the fruit may be preserved. Care must be
taken that the bladder skin be from a kosher animal, and it must also
be kashered by proper salting and rinsing.

31

It is forbidden to drink water from wells and rivers that are known to
be infested with worms (or insects), until the water is filtered, and even
if inadvertently the unfiltered water was used for cooking, it is





forbidden to eat the food. Similarly it is forbidden to soak meat in such
water or to use it for rinsing any food because the worms attach
themselves to the food.
32

When filtering such water, care must be taken to filter it through a
cloth that will not allow passage even for the very thinnest worms.

33

Vinegar that contains worms should not be eaten even if filtered,
because even the thinnest worm of the sort that grow in vinegar, will
pass through any cloth and the filtering will worsen the situation. It is
best not to filter it because worms that develop in beverages contained
in vessels are not forbidden as long as they do not become separated;
and through filtering, it is possible that the worms will be separated and
remain on the filter and later return to the vinegar. It is best to boil the
vinegar first and then filter it; because once the insects are killed by the
boiling, they will not pass through the filter.

34

Worms that grow in fruit when still attached to the tree are forbidden
even though they did not move from place to place. Sometimes black
spots or dots are found on fruits, beans, and legumes. This is the first
stage of their breeding and they must be cut out with deep penetration,
because this area is forbidden as the worm itself.

35

Some fruits have worms when still attached to the tree. If twelve
months have passed from the time they were picked, they may be eaten,
because any creature that does not have a vertebra cannot exist [more
than] twelve months, and have, therefore, become like mere dust.
However, since it is possible that the fruit became wormy after being
picked, it should be examined, and cleaned from all the worms and





insects found upon the surface. Afterwards they should be placed in
cold water and the water should be thoroughly stirred. As the worms
and worm-eaten particles rise to the surface, they should be thrown
away. The rest should be placed into boiling water so that if any worms
remain they will die immediately, and will not become separated from
the fruit. This procedure may be relied upon only in the cases of
legumes or lentils and the like and then only after the expiration of
twelve months.
36

All fruits that require examination must be opened one by one and the
pits removed and discarded, in order that the examination is thorough.
Great care must be taken regarding this when preserving fruits in honey
and sugar, and similarly when making lekvar (a prune jam). It is not
sufficient to examine only a portion of the fruit, and even if the greater
portion was examined it is not sufficient, but, rather, each fruit must be
examined separately.

37

Flour or similar ground substances occasionally have large worms, and
it is sufficient to sift the flour, because the worms will not pass through;
but if it is infested with mites, sifting is of no avail [and it should be
discarded]. If you have wheat that is infested with worms, consult a
Rabbinic authority as to how should be ground.

38

Anything which is infested with worms and is something not usually
examined for worms is forbidden to be sold to a non-Jew, when there is
a likelihood that the non-Jew might resell it to a Jew. It may be used,
however, in the making of whiskey, and we are not afraid that it will
cause a problem of someone eating it in its present state, providing it is
not kept for a long time.




39


There are many kinds of vegetables that are known to be infested with
worms and some that are infested with mites. Some housewives claim
that singeing the vegetables in fire [destroys the worms], [however, such
a method] is of no avail. There are also certain kinds of fruit and
vegetables that are so infested with worms, that it is almost impossible
to examine them. It is fitting, therefore, that a God-fearing Jew should
not eat any of these. There are certain fruits whose kernels are infested
with worms and it is forbidden to eat them.

40

Walnuts are often infested with mites. They can be tested in this
manner, when the kernel is taken from the shell, the shell should be
tapped on a warm surface. This will bring out the mites that remained
in the shell. Great care should be taken concerning this.

41

Sometimes the rim of the container in which fruits were preserved in
honey and sugar, contain mites. This area must be thoroughly cleansed
and some of the [surface] preserves removed, until it is quite certain
that no insects were left in the preserves.

42

If while cutting a fruit or radish with a knife, you happen to cut up a
worm, you should wipe the knife very well and from the radish or the
fruit, scoop out a bit from the place where the worm was cut.

43

The interior of fish often contain worms, [especially] in the brain, the
liver, the intestines, mouth and ears. This is especially true with a fish
called 'Hecht' (pike), which contains thin, long worms. The places
where they are commonly found must be thoroughly examined. In
herrings thin worms are often found in the milk, and it, therefore,
requires examination. In some regions, the outside of the fish near the





fins and on the fins, in the mouth and behind the ears, are infested
with very small insects that are round as a lentil. These places should be
examined and scraped off very well.
44

If the worms found in cheese, are not repulsive to you, they may be
eaten as long as they are not completely separated from the cheese.

45

Many Divine commandments are written in the Torah regarding
insects. [One who eats them] transgresses many prohibitive
commandments. They also defile the soul, as it is written: ""You will be
defiled through them."" Therefore, everyone must be very careful not to
eat them inadvertently.

46

If you ask a Rav a question concerning the permissibility of an item and
he has forbidden it, you are not allowed to ask another Rav for his
opinion [about the same matter], unless you inform him that the first
Rav decided it was forbidden.
"
"1

In the opinion of some authorities, in our time the wine of a non-Jew
or Jewish wine touched by a non-Jew is forbidden only for drinking but
not for deriving other benefit from it. Therefore, a Jew is permitted to
take non-Jewish wine in payment of a debt, for it is equivalent to saving
it from a loss. The same law applies in avoiding other types of loss, but
only when, for example, the wine was already purchased. However,
initially, it is forbidden to buy such wine in order to make a profit from
it. Some authorities are lenient even in this instance, but it is best to
follow the stricter opinion.




2


It is permissible to make a bath from non-Jewish wine for a sick person,
although he is not critically ill.

Kosher wine that was cooked until it was brought to a boil and its
contents reduced by the boiling, [even] if it was touched by a non-Jew,
it is permissible even for drinking. However, wine into which spices
have been put, such as vermouth, as long as it is still called wine, and
has not been boiled becomes forbidden [when touched by a non-Jew].

4

A dish into which wine was added but is not discernable even if it was
not yet brought to a boil, does not become forbidden when touched by
a non-Jew.

5

Wine that was diluted with six parts of water is no longer considered
wine and does not become forbidden when touched by a non-Jew.
However, raisin wine which is made by pouring water on raisins is
considered real wine.

6

Mead which is made from water poured on the seeds, or on the lees of
wine, as long as it is improved for drinking cannot be permitted, when
touched by a non-Jew.

7

Once even a small quantity of wine has been drawn from a barrel in
which grapes were pressed, or if wine was taken from it in a vessel, the
entire contents of the barrel is considered wine and becomes forbidden
when touched by a non-Jew, even if he touched only the seeds and the
husks. Therefore, barrels of grapes found in the house of a non-Jew are
forbidden since he might have already drawn wine from them. It is also
forbidden to let a non-Jew press grapes, even if the barrel is sealed.




8


Care must be taken that the removal of the seeds and husks from the
presses should not be done by a non-Jew, even after the extraction of
wine from the first and second pressing because it is possible that they
might still be moist with wine.

9

If a non-Jew poured water into wine with the intention of diluting it,
we are not allowed to drink it. But if he had not intended to dilute it,
or even if it was doubtful whether he intended to do so, it is permissible
to drink from it.

10

[If ] wine vinegar made from kosher wine is so strong that it seethes
when poured upon the ground, it no longer becomes forbidden when
touched by a non-Jew. But vinegar produced from non-Jewish wine
always remains forbidden.

11

Similarly, whiskey [brandy] that was produced from non-Jewish wine or
from seeds, skins and lees [of non-Jewish wine,] is considered like the
wine itself. But when [brandy] is made from kosher wine, the touch of
a non-Jew does not make it forbidden.

12

It has become the accepted custom to permit the use of Tartaric Acid,
since it has no taste.

13

If a non-Jew touches the wine by means of another object, [i.e. not
with his own body] or through his power, a Rabbinic authority must be
consulted.

14

If wine is sent [to someone] with a non-Jewish messenger, great care
must be taken that every faucet or spout should be sealed with double





seals.
15

If a Jew produces kosher wine for a non-Jew, for the purpose of selling
it to Jewish customers, the situation raises many special halachic issues,
and in certain circumstances, even double seals or a lock and key are
not sufficient safeguards. It is necessary to consult a Rabbinic authority
as to the proper procedure. One who fears for his soul should avoid this
type of wine.

16

Vessels in which wine is kept for a short time which contained nonJewish wine, and that had no wine in them for twenty four hours,
whether the vessels are made of leather, wood, glass, stone or metal, if
they are not lined with pitch, they should be rinsed well with water
three times and they may be used. If, however, they are lined with
pitch, they have a different halachic status. Similarly, earthenware has a
different halachic status.

17

Vessels that are made for keeping wine in them for a long time, that is,
they are designed to hold wine for at least three days, even though the
vessel belongs to a Jew, and the non-Jew kept wine in the vessel for only
a short time, it, nevertheless, requires a kashering process. The vessel
must be filled with water up to the very brim and be allowed to stay
that way for at least twenty-four hours, which is referred to as mei'eis
le'eis; after that the water should be poured out and refilled a second
time and allowed to stay that way for at least twenty-four hours. This
procedure should be repeated a third time. It is not necessary that the
three twenty-four hour periods be consecutive. If the water remained in
the vessel for many days without being poured out, it counts for only
one twenty-four hour period. Some authorities say that if the wine was





in the vessel for twenty-four hours, it cannot be kashered in this
manner, because after twenty-four hours of soaking, it is considered as
if it was boiled (cooked) and it requires kashering with boiling water.
And if there is no pressing need, it is best to follow this more stringent
opinion.
18

Since glass utensils are smooth and hard; even though wine is kept in
them for long periods, it is sufficient to rinse them three times.

19

[If ] a vessel that contained Jewish wine was emptied of its wine, but the
vessel was still so moist as to moisten other objects, and was touched by
a non-Jew, rinsing it three times is sufficient, even though the vessel was
made to hold wine for a long time.

20

The process of rinsing or of 'emptying' for three days is permissible
only when cold wine was stored in them, but if the wine was hot, it
must be made kosher only by the process of boiling water as if they
contained any other forbidden food.

21

Vessels used in the wine press, even though they are not used for storing
wine, nevertheless, since they are used for an abundance of wine, we
deal with them more stringently and a Rabbinic authority should be
consulted for the proper way to kasher them.

22

Any vessels that have not been used for twelve months may be used
[without any kashering process], because we are certain that no moisture
of wine was left in them. Even if water was poured in them during the
twelve month period, it does not matter.

If bread that is [made] from the five species of grain was made as kisnin,
and you eat less than the quantity sufficient for a meal, it does not
require netilas yadayim—washing the hands and it does not require the
berachah, Hamotzi, rather the berachah Borei minei mezonos, and after
it the berachah, Al hamichyah. However, if you eat the amount
sufficient for a meal, it is governed by the same law as regular bread,
[i.e.] it requires netilas yadayim, and the berachah, Hamotzi, and after
[eating] Birkas Hamazon.

2

What is bread made as kisnin? Some [poskim] say: that it is bread made
in the shape of pockets, filled with fruit meat or cheese or with similar
things, or when it is made like a ""strudel"" [fruits and nuts rolled in
dough and baked]. And other [poskim] say: that it is bread kneaded
with oil, or fat or honey, or milk, or eggs or fruit juices, even if they
were also mixed [with] water, as long as it is less than half [the liquid].
We accept both opinions in order to be lenient and we consider both
[kinds of baked goods] as ""bread that comes with kisnin.""

3

The amount considered sufficient for a meal is not set individually for
each person, but by what most people [average people] usually consume
for the midday meal, or for the evening meal to satisfy their appetite. If
you eat this quantity, although you are not satisfied, nevertheless, it is
considered bread. And, if you ate this bread with a spread [or dip], we
also estimate the amount by considering if others would satiated if they
ate the same amount with a spread. But if you ate a smaller quantity
without a spread and your appetite is satisfied, but if others would eat





this amount they would not be satiated, but if they would eat it with a
spread they would be satiated, then the laws of bread apply.
4

If your original intention was to eat only a little (i.e. less than a ""meal"")
and you said: Borei minei mezonos and then reconsidered to eat the
amount sufficient for ""a meal,"" if the additional amount that you now
want to eat is not sufficient for a meal unless it is combined with what
you originally ate, you may eat it as is and afterwards say the Birkas
Hamazon. But if the additional amount you now want to eat has [in
itself ] an amount sufficient for ""a meal,"" you must do netilas yadayim
and say the berachah Hamotzi on that which you now want to eat. But
the berachah, Al hamichya, need not be recited on that which you
[originally] ate, because it becomes combined with that which you will
now eat and will be exempt with the Birkas Hamazon.

5

Dough kneaded with water, which has a loose, soft consistency and is
baked in an oven or even in a pan [on an open fire] without liquid,
even if the pan was greased with oil, in order that the dough not burn,
is not considered ""liquid"" and it has the law of real bread. [And thus]
even if you eat of it only a kazayis, it requires netilas yadayim, Hamotzi
and Birkas Hamazon. But, if it is fried in liquid [oil], it is not
considered bread, even if you eat of it a quantity which satisfies your
appetite. Likewise, those flat wafers which are very thin that are baked
in a press between two iron plates, do not have the law of bread. And
even if you ate of them a quantity which satisfies your appetite, you
need only recite Borei minei mezonos and the after-berachah, Al
hamichyah. Sometimes dough is made very thin in the following
manner: flour and water are put into a pot and mixed with a spoon and





poured over vegetable leaves and baked in the oven over the leaves. This
dough has the halachah of kisnin.
6

Dough that was boiled and then baked, such as bagels or pretzels, is
[considered] real bread, but only if it was well-baked.

7

Real bread that was boiled, or fried in butter or in similar [shortening],
even if it lost the appearance of bread, for instance [when the bread]
was completely covered with egg, if the slice is a kazayis, it has all the
laws of bread. If each slice is not a kazayis, even if through the cooking
it expanded and now each slice is a kazayis, or if [the pieces] became
attached through cooking and is now one large mass, even if they have
the appearance of bread, nevertheless, it is not considered ""bread,"" and
its berachah is only Borei minei mezonos and after eating it the berachah
Al hamichyah. This is so even if you ate enough to be satiated. But, if
you did not boil it, but poured hot gravy upon it, it is a doubtful
berachah because it is questionable whether or not iruy—pouring is
considered ""boiling"" in our case (of kisnin). [Therefore, such pudding]
should be eaten only in the course of a meal. But, if it was not boiled,
but soaked in liquid or in soup, and the pieces [individually] are not a
kazayis, in such a case it depends if they have the appearance of bread
or not; if they have the appearance of bread, they then have all the laws
pertaining to ""bread."" And if they don't have the appearance of bread,
they do not have the laws of bread, and even if you ate enough to
satisfy your appetite, you only say the berachah, Borei minei mezonos,
and afterwards Al hamichya. If the appearance of the liquid changed,
because of the pieces [of bread], [then] it is definite that they have lost
the appearance of ""bread."" Likewise, if they were soaked in red wine,
they no longer have the appearance of bread.




8


Even if dough was kneaded only with water and then boiled, you recite
the berachah, Borei minei mezonos and after it Al hamichyah. This is so
even if you ate enough to be satiated. Similarly, ground grain [groats] or
whole grain that was made of the five species of grain and then boiled,
the berachah is also; Borei minei mezonos, and afterwards: Al hamichyah,
even if you eat enough to satisfy your appetite. If you eat them with the
soup [that they were boiled in] and similarly—foods made of dough
that are eaten with the soup or with the milk that were cooked in, you
need not recite a berachah on the soup or milk, because they are
secondary and lose their significance to the food. But, if you cooked
only a small amount of cereal or groats and the main object is only for
the soup or the milk, in such a case they do not lose their significance
and you recite the berachah, Shehakol, over it. And even though you eat
the cereal or groats also, the soup or milk do not lose their significance
because they are considered the main object. Nevertheless, in order to
do the mitzvah in the most appropriate manner, it is proper that you
first recite the berachah Shehakol only on the soup or the milk and
drink a small amount by itself (avoiding any of the grain), and
afterwards recite the berachah Borei minei mezonos on the cereal or
groats, because although the intent (of the cooking) was not for them,
they do not become secondary. Grain is [always] considered a major
[food] and does not become secondary to forfeit its own berachah as
long as its purpose is to add flavor to the food being cooked.

9

Foods that are prepared with ground matza (matza meal) or with bread
crumbs (e.g., ""kneidlach""—matza-balls and pancakes) that are mixed
with oil, eggs, and milk and are kneaded [all together] and then boiled





or fried, their berachah is: Borei minei mezonos, and afterwards: Al
hamichyah.




10


If food made of one of the grains was boiled with other foods such as
bits of dough with green peas or dried beans (eg. barley with green peas
and/or dried beans), even if the other food (peas or beans) is the major
ingredient, nevertheless, since each is separate unto itself, it requires two
berachos: first on some of the bits of dough make the berachah, Borei
minei mezonos, and eat them, and then on some of the beans make the
berachah, Borei peri ha'adamah, and eat them [separately]. After that,
you may eat them together. And the soup (in which they were cooked)
is secondary and does not require a berachah. But if they dissolved and
were totally merged together (i.e., into a new food form) for instance a
dish that is prepared by mixing flour, eggs, and cheese and then boiled
or fried (e.g., pancakes or blintzes), even though the flour is the lesser
quantity, nevertheless, since it is [made of ] one of the five grains, it is
considered primary and the berachah is Borei minei mezonos, and
afterwards Al hamichyah. However, this rule applies only when the flour
is added to contribute to its taste. But, if only a little is added as a
binder (or thickener), as is regularly done to prepare various sauces with
a small amount of flour, and similarly, baked confections [that are made
with] almonds, sugar and eggs with a little flour added merely as a
binder, then the flour loses its identity and the berachah is made on the
major ingredient only. The same applies to gravy [or sauce] that is
boiled or fried with some flour, browned and fried in butter, the
berachah made on the sauce or gravy is shehakol. But if you pick out the
bits of browned flour and eat them separately, you must make the
berachah, Borei minei mezonos. If you ate a kazayis of them you must
make the berachah, Al hamichyah, afterwards.




"
"1

Just as bread has, because of its importance, been given a special berachah, Hamotzi,
rather than Boray minei mezonos—the berachah on all foods made of the five species
of grain; so has wine been honored with its own berachah—Borey pri hagafen.This is
so because wine not only satiates, but, also gladdens the heart (Ps. 104 ) (Maseches
Berachos 35). Additionally, wine has other qualities as evidenced by the requirement
that the kiddush and havdallah, as well as sheva berachos, are said over wine. In
addition, wine was also assigned its own after-berachah, i.e. Al Ha'gefen.This chapter
deals with determining at what point in the process of wine preparation does it
achieve the status of ""wine,"" and at what point of its deterioration does it turn into
""vinegar,"" losing the status of ""wine.""

The berachah on wine is Borei peri hagafen and after [drinking it] Al
hagefen, etc. It makes no difference whether the wine is still bubbling
[or not]. Even if [the wine] is flowing of its own accord, even cooked
wine or konditin, that is [wine] into which were added honey and/or
spices or wormwood which is bitter. Even if the wine smells like
vinegar, as long as it has the taste of wine, it is considered wine as far as
its berachah is concerned. But, if it has turned vinegary, to the extent
that some people refrain from drinking it because of its sour taste, then
the berachah is in question. (And although you can say the berachah,
Shehakol, before drinking it, there is still a question about the afterberachah.) Therefore, you should not drink it unless you first make a
berachah over good wine [and drink it.]
2

Concerning grape seeds from which wine was extracted only by means
of trampling, but which were not pressed in a [heavy duty] wine press,
the following should be noted: if water was poured upon them, even if





they recovered no more [water] than they poured [on them], or even if
they recovered less, nevertheless, if it has the taste of wine, the berachah
is Borei peri hagafen. But, if the seeds were pressed in a [heavy duty]
wine press and then the water was poured on them or they poured
water upon the residue [in the vat from which all the seeds were
removed], it is considered as water.
3

If wine was diluted with water, and the wine is only one sixth of the
mixture [i.e., five parts water to one part wine,] the wine is definitely
nullified, and it is considered as water. But, if it has more wine [than
one sixth], and it is the custom of the people of that area to dilute it to
that degree and to drink it as wine, the berachah over it is Borei peri
hagafen and afterwards Al hagefen. However if the people of that area do
not drink it as wine, the individual's opinion does not count [and the
berachah is Shehakol].

4

Just as bread, if eaten as part of a meal, exempts all sorts of food [from a
berachah], so does wine, when it is part of a wine repast, exempt other
beverages from a pre-berachah and from an after-berachah. This is so
only if the beverages were before you at the time you said the berachah
over the wine or at the very least it was your intention to drink those
beverages. But, if they were not before you, and it was not your
intention to drink them, it is an unresolved question [among the
poskim] if you must say a berachah on them or not. Therefore, you
should refrain from drinking them [i.e., those beverages] until after you
recite the after-berachah on the wine, or you may make the berachah,
Shehakol, on some food and keep in mind to include those [late
arriving] beverages.




5


If you did not ""sit down to a repast of wine,"" but drank in a casual
manner and you also did not intend to drink other beverages, you are
certainly required to make the pre-berachah on the other beverages.
However, there is still a question about the after-berachah—whether
[the other beverages are] exempt by the berachah Al hagefen that you
say on the wine. Therefore, you should eat any fruit whose afterberachah is Borei nafashos rabos [in order] to exempt the [other]
beverages.

6

If you recite kiddush over wine and intend to drink whiskey or coffee
afterwards, there is a question if they were exempted by the berachah
[made] over the wine. Therefore, you should have in mind not to
exempt them [while saying Borei peri hagafen]. Still [in order to satisfy
all sides of the question], you should say the berachah, Shehakol, over a
bit of sugar [candy, or the like], [and have in mind] to exempt also the
beverages [whiskey, coffee, etc.]

7

When you say a berachah over wine during the meal and there are
other people present, you should [first] say: Savri Rabbosai, meaning:
""Pay attention to hear me,"" so that they will stop eating and listen to
the berachah.

8

If a group was drinking one kind of wine, whether during the meal or
not during the meal, and another kind of wine was brought, they need
not say Borei peri hagafen over the new wine, since they did not
""reconsider"" nor ""remove their thought"" from the wine, but they do say
over the new wine the berachah, Hatov vehameitiv. Likewise, if they
brought a third kind of wine, they also say over it: Hatov vehameitiv.





The same [applies] to [as] many [wines] that are brought out. (We learn
this from the conduct of Rebbe who, over every new jug of wine that
was opened would say the berachah, Hatov vehameitiv.)
9

If they actually ""reconsidered"" in the manner that requires them to say
the berachah Borei peri hagafen a second time, they should first say the
berachah, Hatov vehameitiv, and afterwards the berachah, Borei peri
hagafen.

10

The berachah Hatov vehameitiv is [said] only when [the quality of the
second wine] is unknown, [that is,] you are not certain that the second
[wine] is of a lesser quality than the first; though you do not know if it
is a better quality than the first wine. But, if it is known to be of a lesser
quality than the first [of wine], the berachah is not said over it.
However, if it is more healthful for the body than the first [wine],
though it is inferior in taste, we do say the berachah Hatov vehameitiv
over it.

11

Even if you had both wines, but they were not before you, when you
said the berachah Borei peri hagafen, you should say the berachah,
Hatov vehameitiv, over the superior second wine. But, if they were both
before you on the table, you do not say the berachah Hatov vehameitiv.
You then say Borei peri hagafen over the better wine and it will exempt
the poorer quality [wine].

12

The berachah, Hatov vehameitiv, is said only if there is still some of the
original wine [on the table] and you want to drink the second wine in
order to have variety. But, if they are now bringing the second wine [to





the table] because the first wine has been consumed, the berachah
[Hatov vehameitiv] is not said over it.
13

The berachah Hatov vehameitiv is said only when there is another
person with you who is also drinking from both wines, for that is
implied [in the text of the berachah] ""He is good""—to the person ""and
he is benevolent""—to his companion; and the same law applies if your
wife and children are with you. But, if you are alone, you do not say
[Hatov vehameitiv] over it (the second wine).

14

When a guest eats at the table of his host, and the host places the wine
bottle on the table so that whoever wishes may drink, as is done at
lavish feasts, then the wine is considered as communal property, and the
berachah Hatov vehameitiv is said. But if the host doles out a cup of
wine to each guest, Hatov vehameitiv is not said, since they have no
""proprietorship"" in the wine and [therefore] even the host does not say
[Hatov vehameitiv].

15

One [of the group] may say the berachah to exempt the entire group,
[but] he should first say: Savri… (""Attention…); so that they pay
attention to hear [every word of the berachah]; and they should reply:
""Amen"" so that they be exempt through his berachah. But, only [is the
above applicable] if each one has his glass [of wine] before him to taste
at once, so that there will be no interruption between the berachah and
the drinking [of the wine].

16

If you are saying Birkas hamazon over a glass of different wine, you
need not say the berachah of Hatov vehameitiv over it because you will





have fulfilled your obligation with the Hatov vehameitiv said in Birkas
hamazon.
"
"1

It is written, ""The earth is Hashem's and the fullness thereof,"" [which
implies] that everything is like consecrated matter. And just as it is
forbidden to derive benefit from sacred things before they are
redeemed, and anyone who derives benefit from sacred things without
prior redemption is guilty of misusing sacred property, so it is
forbidden to derive pleasure from this world without [first reciting] a
berachah, and the berachah constitutes the redemption. If you enjoyed
any food, etc. and [before you did] you failed to recite a berachah, it is
as though you misused something that is sacred to Hashem, blessed be
His Name. There is no minimum quantity of food over which the preberachah must be said, for if you eat or drink even the smallest
quantity, you must recite the pre-berachah.

2

Although, if inadvertently, you had already recited [the berachah]
shehakol over anything, even over bread or wine, you would have
fulfilled your obligation, you may not do this deliberately. It is your
duty to study in order to know which berachah [is appropriate] for each
individual kind [of food]. However, if you are unable to determine
under which category [the article] is classified, or if the authorities are
in doubt and no [clear-cut] decision can be made [concerning the
appropriate berachah], then you may discharge your obligation [by
reciting] the berachah shehakol. But if it is something that you can





exempt [from a berachah] [by eating it] during the meal, so much the
better.
3

The article [over which you are about] to recite the berachah before
eating, drinking, smelling it, or performing a mitzvah with it, should be
taken, with your right hand, before [reciting] the berachah. You should
then consider [carefully] what [berachah] is appropriate for it, so that
when you mention Hashem's Name, which is the most important part
of the berachah, you will know how to conclude it. If you did not hold
(the object) at all, but it was merely lying in front of you when you
recited the berachah, you fulfilled your obligation. However, if (the
object) was not in front of you when you said the berachah, rather, it
was brought to you afterwards, even though, while reciting the
berachah your mind was on [the object], then you have not fulfilled
your obligation, and you must repeat the berachah.

4

If you took in your hand a fruit to eat, and recited the berachah over it,
and it fell out of your hand and was lost, or it became so spoiled, that it
was inedible; and, similarly, if you said a berachah over a beverage and
the beverage spilled, if [at that time] there was more of the same food
or beverage on the table and you also intended to eat or drink more
than you were holding in your hand; consequently the berachah
referred also to the other things [before you], then you need not repeat
the berachah. But in an ordinary case, the berachah applies only to that
which you were holding in your hand, and you must repeat the
berachah. Similarly, even if you intended to eat or drink more [of the
food that fell from your hand, or was lost or became unappetizing] but
it was not on the table at the time you said the berachah, but was
served [later], then you must repeat the berachah. [This holds true]





even in the case where if you ate or drank the original food; you would
not have had to recite the berachah over the food that was to be served
[later]; because this case is different.
5

You must not pause longer than it would take to utter [a short greeting]
between the berachah [over the food] and eating it. Even while
chewing, you may not pause until you swallow it. (For chewing [or
tasting] do not require a berachah, see par. 7.) Now, if after the
berachah but before eating, you interrupted by saying, something that
was unrelated to the meal, then you must repeat the berachah.
However, if you paused silently, then you need not repeat the berachah.
Any delay which is necessary for the purpose of the meal, is not
considered an interruption. Therefore, if you wish to eat [a portion of ]
a large fruit [which you must] cut up into small pieces, then you should
recite the berachah while the fruit is [still] whole, for it is considered an
[enhancement of ] a mitzvah to say a berachah over something that is
whole; and the pause [caused by cutting up the fruit] is not considered
an interruption, because [this cutting] is necessary in order to eat [the
fruit]. On the other hand, if you wish to eat a fruit, [and this is the only
one available], and you have none other, and there is reason to suspect
that this fruit contains worms which would make it unfit to be eaten,
then you must open it and examine it before reciting the berachah.

6

If you are about to drink water, and you [wish to] spill a little of it
before drinking because you are afraid that the [surface] water [might
be] tainted, then you should spill [the water] before you begin to recite
the berachah and not after the berachah, as this would imply disrespect
of the berachah.




7


If you taste food [in order to determine] whether it needs salt or for any
similar purpose and then you spit it out, no blessing is required. But if
you swallow it, there is a question whether a berachah should be said,
because [after all] you did swallow it, or [possibly], you need not recite
a blessing because you did not intend eating it. In view of this, be
careful to bear in mind [when tasting something], to enjoy it as food
and say the berachah over it, and swallow it.

8

If you eat or drink something for medicinal purposes, and it is tasteful
and you enjoy it, you should recite the appropriate berachah before and
after [taking it], even if it consists of forbidden food. Since under the
present circumstances, the Torah permits it, you should say the
berachah over it. However, if it has a bitter flavor and is distasteful to
you, then do not say the berachah over it. If you drink a raw egg in
order to make your voice clear, although you do not enjoy the taste,
you do enjoy the nourishment it provides; and you should recite the
berachah over it.

9

If a food particle became lodged in your throat, and you drink a
beverage or eat a piece of bread [to help you] swallow [the particle], or
[if you swallow] something else that you enjoy [in order to dislodge the
particle], then you should say the berachah over it before [swallowing]
and after. However, if you drink water, not because of thirst, but solely
for the purpose of dislodging something that sticks in your throat, or
for any other purpose, you should not recite the berachah, because a
person only enjoys drinking water when he drinks in order [to quench]
his thirst.




10


If, unwittingly, you took food into your mouth without having said the
berachah, [observe the following rules:] if it is something that even
when ejected would not become unappetizing, it should be ejected into
your hand and a berachah should be said over it. The berachah should
not be recited while [the food] is still in your mouth, for it is written:
""Let my mouth be filled with Your praise."" If it is something that
would become unappetizing when ejected, since it is forbidden to waste
food, it should be moved to one side of the mouth, and the berachah
should be recited. However, in the case of a beverage which cannot be
moved to one side [of the mouth] [in order to say the berachah]; if
more of the beverage is available, it should be ejected and allowed to go
to waste. If there is no other [beverage], and you urgently need the little
that you have in your mouth, you should swallow it and then say the
pre-berachah; (since you reminded yourself while [the food] was still in
your mouth it may be considered, to a certain extent, [as though you
had said the berachah] before partaking of the food,) but the afterberachah should not be recited. If [the beverage] was wine and you
drank a revi'is, the after-berachah should be also said.

11

If you have in front of you two kinds of food, both subject to the same
berachah, for example, a nut and an apple, so that you can recite a
berachah over one, and [thereby] exempt the other, you should do so. It
is forbidden to say the berachah over one kind with the intention of not
exempting the other in order to say a separate berachah over the other
kind; since it is forbidden to cause the uttering of an unnecessary
berachah. Rather, you should say the berachah over the food that is
superior; (see Chapter 55) and the other kind is thereby exempt, even
though you did not intend to exempt it. But if you said the berachah





over the inferior kind, then the superior is not exempt unless you had
the intention to exempt it; but if you said the berachah without clearcut intention, then you must repeat the berachah over the superior
kind, since it is not proper that a [berachah over] an inferior kind
should exempt the superior kind, without intent.
12

If there are two kinds [of fruit], for example, a fruit of a tree and a fruit
of the earth, or food over which the berachah Shehakol should be said;
[then], in spite of the fact that post factum [when it is already done], if
you had said Shehakol over all of them, or if you had said over a fruit of
the tree the berachah Borei peri ha'adamah, you would have fulfilled
your obligation; nevertheless, initially you must not do this, rather you
should recite the appropriate berachah over each kind. The berachah
Borei peri ha'eitz takes precedence [over the others] (see Ch. 55, par. 4).
Even if there are wine and grapes in front of you, and you wish to drink
wine, and said the berachah, Borei peri hagafen; even though it is
permitted to exempt the grapes with this berachah nevertheless, initially
you must not do so. Rather, keep in mind not to exempt the grapes
[with the berachah over wine], so as to enable you to say the proper
berachah, which is Borei peri ha'eitz, over the grapes.

13

If you change places, when eating any kind of food except bread (which
is discussed in Ch. 42, par. 19, 20, 21) if you change places, even
though your mind was not distracted [from the food], it is considered
as though your mind was distracted [from the food]. Consequently, if
you eat or drink in one room and then move to another room, in order
to conclude your eating and drinking there, even if the food is of the
same kind [with which you began the meal], or even if you hold in
your hand the food or the beverage, and you carry it into the other





room, nevertheless, you must repeat the preceding berachah there.
However the after-berachah over what you have eaten before [in the
first room] is not required, for the after-berachah [of the entire meal]
will suffice for both.
14

Similarly, if you go outside [the house], and then return to your former
place to finish the meal, you must repeat the pre-berachah. This rule
applies only when you have eaten alone, or when you have eaten in the
company of others and all of them left their places. But, if one of the
company remained in his place, then when the others return to resume
eating and drinking, they need not repeat the berachah since they
intended to return to the companion who remained, and to finish their
meal [with him]. Since one of the company remained there, the status
of fixed place was not cancelled; and they all retain their original status,
and it is all considered as one meal.

15

[When you go] from one corner of a room to another, no matter how
large the room may be, it is not considered a change of place.

16

If you eat fruit in an orchard which is fenced in and you recite the
berachah over the fruit of one tree with the intention of eating fruit of
other trees also, you may eat from the other trees even if they are not
within your view, for as long as your mind was not distracted you do
not have to repeat the berachah. However, if the orchard is not fenced
in, and certainly [if you go] from one orchard to another, [the fact that
your mind was not distracted] is of no avail, [and you must repeat the
berachah].
"

1


[After eating] the fruit of any tree, which is not of the seven species (see
paragraph seven) or of any fruit of the ground, or any vegetable, or any
food that was not grown in the soil, you should say the concluding
berachah, Borei nefashos rabbos. Even if you ate and drank, one [after-]
berachah is sufficient for both.

2

The after-berachah as well as Birkas Hamazon should not be said unless
you have eaten the prescribed quantity [of food], which is [no less than]
a kazayis. But for less than this quantity, you need not say an afterberachah. According to some authorities, you need not say the
concluding berachah after drinking liquids unless you drank a revi'is.
Other authorities maintain that even after drinking a kazayis, you must
say the after-berachah. Therefore, in order to avoid any doubt be
careful to drink either less than a kazayis or [at least] a revi'is. It makes
no difference [in this connection] whether you drink whiskey or any
other beverage.

3

Some authorities maintain, that after eating a whole thing, which grew
naturally, such as a nut or some other fruit, even one single bean, even
if its quantity is less than a kazayis, nevertheless, since it is a whole fruit,
you must recite the after-berachah. Other authorities disagree.
Therefore, to avoid any doubt, you should not eat less than a kazayis. If
the article was divided before it was eaten, it loses its special
importance, and all authorities agree that you should not say the afterberachah if it was less than a kazayis.

4

All articles of food combine [to make up] a kazayis. So, if you ate half a
kazayis of something that requires the after-berachah, Borei nefashos





rabbos, [and then you ate] another half a kazayis of a food after which
the ""three-faceted"" [after-] berachah, is said or even if you ate half a
kazayis of bread, you recite the after-berachah, Borei nefashos rabbos.
And it seems to me that the same ruling applies if you ate half a kazayis
of fruit after which the berachah Al ha'eitz is said, together with half a
kazayis of food after which the berachah Al hamichyah is said, or [you
ate] half a kazayis of bread; (even though in this case there is no food
which requires as its after-berachah [the recitation of ] Borei nefashos
rabbos), nevertheless, you should say Borei nefashos rabbos as the afterberachah. If you ate half a kazayis of a food after which the afterberachah Al hamichyah is said together with half a kazayis of bread, you
should recite Al hamichyah as the after-berachah. Food and drink do
not combine [to make up the minimum quantity].
5

If you ate half a kazayis and waited, then you ate the second half of a
kazayis, and the interval between the beginning of eating and the end of
eating did not exceed the time it takes to eat half a loaf of bread; then
the two acts of eating are combined, and the after-berachah is recited
afterwards. However, if you paused longer than this interval, they are
not combined; and as for drinking, even if your pause was shorter than
the interval [just mentioned], the separate acts of drinking are not
combined.

6

If you drink a hot beverage slowly, (like tea or coffee), since you do not
drink the minimum quantity required for a berachah at one time, even
though this is the usual manner of drinking; nevertheless, the different
sips are not combined and you should not recite the after-berachah.




7


The Land of Israel is praised, for seven species of food as it is written,
""A land of wheat and barley and vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a
land of olive trees and honey-dates,"" and thereafter it is written, ""A land
where you will eat bread without poverty … ""When you have eaten
and are satisified, you shall bless [Hashem, your God.""] Since with
regard to bread the Torah is explicit in its command, ""When you have
eaten and are satisified, you shall bless;"" therefore, [if you eat] bread
made of the five species of grain, namely: wheat and barley which are
expressly mentioned in the Torah text, and also spelt, or oats, or rye
which also come under the heading of wheat and barley, you must
recite Birkas Hamazon afterwards. Birkas Hamazon consists of three
complete berachos and also the berachah Hatov Vehameitiv (which was
instituted later on at the Yeshivah in Yavneh). However, [after eating]
any food that is not bread, but which is made of flour from the species
of grain [mentioned above]; similarly [after drinking] wine or eating
grapes, either fresh or dried, large or small, or after eating figs,
pomegranates, olives or dates, since dates are the ""honey"" the Torah
speaks of, inasmuch as honey oozes from them; [after eating] any of
these you must say the ""three-faceted berachah."" as the after-berachah.
[It is called that name] because it contains in abridged form, three
berachos as well as the berachah Hatov Vehameitiv of the Birkas
Hamazon.

8

The ""three-faceted berachah,"" which is [said] after [eating food] [over
which the berachah] Borei minei mezonos is said begins as follows:
[""Blessed are You]… for the food and for the sustenance,"" and
concludes [with the words]: ""And we thank You for the land and for
the food. Blessed are You, Hashem for the land and for the food, and for





the sustenance."" The berachah after drinking wine begins: ""For the vine
and for the fruit of the vine,"" and concludes, ""And we thank You for
the land and for the fruit of the vine. Blessed are you Hashem for the
land and for the fruit of the vine."" The berachah after eating fruit
begins: ""For the trees and for the fruit of the trees,"" and concludes:
""And we thank You for the land and for the fruits. Blessed are You
Hashem, for the land and for the fruits."" In Eretz Yisrael or even
elsewhere, if you eat fruit that comes from Eretz Yisrael, you conclude
the berachah thus: ""for the land and its fruits."" If you eat various kinds
of food made of grain and drink some wine [with them], you combine
the two berachos into one berachah.The same rule applies for fruit and
wine; even if you eat grapes and drink wine, or eat fruit and food made
of grain, or even food made of grain in conjuction with wine and fruit,
you combine the three berachos into one. First you say ""for the food""
and then ""for the vine"" and finally, ""for the trees."" When you combine
""for the food"" with any other formula then do not say at the conclusion
""and for the sustenance,"" but say ""Blessed are You Hashem, for the land
and for the food and for the fruit of the vine,"" or ""for the food and for
the fruits,"" or ""for the food and for the fruit of the vine and for the
fruits."" The text has already been published in prayer books, and it is
the duty of every Jew to know this berachah well and commit it to
memory.
9

On Shabbos or Yom Tov or Rosh Chodesh, we include [in the afterberachah] whatever relates to these days, but if you forgot to include it,
you need not repeat the berachah.

10

You should be as strict [with this berachah] as you are with the Birkas
Hamazon (mentioned in Chapter 42:6, above).




11


In the berachah Borei nefashos, some authorities hold [that we should
say] shebarasa [which You have created], while others hold [that we
should say] shebara [which He has created]. The latter version is the
correct one, for the meaning of the berachah is: Who has created
numerous living things, and what they lack. He has created the living
beings and also their wants, that is to say, all their basic needs, which are
indispensible to sustain life, such as bread and water, and also for all the
other things which He created which are not so vital, but are a source
of enjoyment, such as fruit and the like. [For all these] we thank You,
Who are the life of the worlds. You should pronounce the letter ches [in

12

If you have eaten fruit, whose after-berachah is the ""three-faceted
berachah,"" and you have also eaten some fruit whose after-berachah is
Borei nefashos, You should recite the ""three-faceted berachah,"" and since
you mention in it ""the fruit of the tree"" you exempt with it all other
kinds of fruit you have eaten. However, if you had to say the berachah,
Borei nefashos, for any other kind of food you ate [not fruit of the tree],
then you are not exempt by the ""three-faceted berachah."" You should
first say the ""three-faceted berachah,"" and afterwards Borei nefashos.

13

Initially you are forbidden to leave your place or to engage in any
activity until you have recited the after-berachah, lest you forget to say
it. Nevertheless, if you left your place, and the berachah you [neglected]
to say was Borei nefashos rabbos, you may say it where you are now. But
if you must say the ""three-faceted berachah,"" then you must return to
your place [where you have eaten] just as you would have to do if it
were Birkas Hamazon (see Ch. 44:9 above).




14


[If ] after eating or drinking, you neglected to say the after-berachah
immediately, you may recite the berachah until the food is digested,
which is as long as you have no desire to eat fruit, and after drinking, as
long as you are not thirsty again. After these time limits, you can no
longer say the berachah. If you are unable to estimate [the time
properly], you should, after remembering that you did not say the afterberachah, say a [pre-] berachah and eat some more of the same kind of
food, and then say the after-berachah thereby exempting the food you
ate before.

15

If someone ate or drank and vomited, the concluding berachah should
not be said; as it is the same [as though] [the food] had already been
digested.
"
"1

Over fruits that grow on a tree you say the berachah Borei peri ha'eitz,
[Who created the fruit of the tree]. Over fruit [or vegetables] that grow
in the ground, which include various condiments, vegetables, legumes,
corn, and herbs, you say the berachah, Borei peri ha'adamah, [Who
created the fruit of the ground]. In order to be called a tree, it must
have branches that survive the winter to produce leaves again, even
though they are as thin as stalks of flax. However, [a plant] whose
branches perish in the winter, although its roots remain intact, is not
called a tree, and over its fruit we say, Borei peri ha'adamah.

2

[Before partaking of ] food which does not grow in the earth such as
meat, fish, milk, and cheese, and, similarly, [before drinking] any





beverage other than wine and olive oil, you say the berachah, Shehakol
niyah bidevaro [through Whose word everything came to be]. The word
3

Even though mushrooms and truffles, grow in the moisture of the
earth, they do not receive nourishment from the earth, but rather from
the atmosphere. Therefore, they cannot be called fruit of the ground,
and you should say Shehakol over them.

4

We say the berachah Borei peri ha'eitz and Borei peri ha'adamah only
over articles of foods which are best eaten raw and which, as a rule, are
eaten raw. However, if it is not the custom to eat them raw, but only
when cooked, even though they could also be eaten raw, nevertheless,
since that is not the favored way [they are eaten], their berachah is said
only when they are eaten in their cooked state. But if you do eat them
raw, you should recite only Shehakol. Pickled food is considered as
cooked food. Consequently, before eating sauerkraut you should say
Borei peri ha'adamah. Similarly, salted food is considered the same as
cooked food.

5

Before eating radishes, you should say Borei peri ha'adamah. Likewise,
over garlic and onions that are soft and can be eaten raw, although, as a
rule, they are eaten with bread, nevertheless, even if you eat them
without bread, you recite over them Borei peri ha'adamah. But if the
[garlic or onions] have grown old which give them a very strong flavor,
so that they are not usually eaten raw, then, if you do eat them raw, you
should say the berachah Shehakol.




6


[If you eat] articles of food that taste better raw than cooked, because
cooking spoils them, then you should say over them when they are
cooked, only the berachah Shehakol. Even if they are cooked with meat
and their taste improved because of the meat, nevertheless, since the
meat is the main dish, we recite over them only the berachah, Shehakol.
However, if they were cooked in a way that made them into the main
dish, or if [the cooking] improved them, as for example, when they
were fried in oil or in honey, and the like, you should say their
appropriate berachah, since it makes no difference whether they were
cooked in water or in oil or in honey, [as long as the food itself was
improved by the cooking process].

7

Inferior kinds of fruit that grow on brambles and thorn-bushes or on
other trees which grow wild and are not planted, such as wild apples
and the like, which when raw are not fit to eat, [then] even if they are
cooked or fried in honey and sugar and made edible, you should recite
Shehakol over them. But hazel nuts, although they grow [wild] in the
forest, are considered superior articles of food and you should recite
Borei peri ha'eitz over them.

8

Herbs which grow wild without cultivation are fit to eat raw. If they are
cooked and made into a special dish, nevertheless, since they were not
cultivated [by man], they are not considered a fruit [of the ground] and
you should say Shehakol over them. But lettuce and similar [vegetables]
that are planted require the berachah, Borei peri ha'adamah.
Furthermore, regarding herbs that grow wild, if they produce superior
fruit, such as blackberries and raspberries, the berachah said over them
is Borei peri ha'adamah.




9


That which is not the main part of the fruit, is not considered as the
fruit itself, but is one level lower. If it is the fruit of a tree, you say over
the secondary part the berachah, Borei peri ha'adamah; and if it is the
fruit of the ground, you say over the secondary part the berachah,
Shehakol. Therefore, a caper tree whose leaves are edible, and where its
leaves [are joined with the stem] there are small [edible] buds like the
growths at the juncture of willow leaves, and the caper-berries form the
main part of the fruit, while the caper flowers are only a peel around
the fruit, like the shell of a nut, but are also edible, [consequently], over
the berries which constitute the fruit itself, you say the berachah Borei
peri ha'eitz, and over the leaves and the little buds and the flowers, [you
say] Borei peri ha'adamah. Likewise, over preserves made of rose leaves
with honey and sugar, you say the berachah, Borei peri ha'adamah, for
although they grow on trees, they are not fruit. Similarly, over preserves
made of orange peel, honey, and sugar, you say the berachah, Borei peri
ha'adamah. Over cucumber peel that was fried with honey and sugar,
you say the berachah Shehakol. Over the pods of peas that are cultivated
in the fields, even though they taste sweet, yet, if you ate them without
the peas, you should recite the berachah, Shehakol. But those which
have been grown in gardens for the purpose of eating them raw in their
pods, even if you only eat the pods, you should say the berachah, Borei
peri ha'adamah.

10

Over the seeds of fruit that are sweet, you say the berachah, Borei peri
ha'adamah. But bitter tasting seeds are worth nothing at all, and if you
eat them, you do not say a berachah. But if you make them pleasanttasting by roasting them, or in any other way, you say the berachah,
Shehakol, over them.




11


Small almonds are bitter and the principal food for which they are
planted is the shell which is not bitter, and over these you recite the
berachah, Borei peri ha'eitz. But when they are large, the principal food
[are the kernels] which are inside the shell. If these taste bitter, and you
eat them [raw], you do not say any berachah. But if you made them
pleasant-tasting by roasting them or in any other way, since they are
fruit and were planted for that purpose, you say the berachah, Borei peri
ha'eitz over them. Over sugar-coated almonds even if there is more
sugar than almond [in the confection], nevertheless, you say the
berachah Borei peri ha'eitz. Over sugar-coated calamus [an aromatic
root], you only say Shehakol, since calamus is not a fruit.

12

It is customary to fry unripe fruit in honey or sugar, you should say the
berachah, Shehakol over them. But over an esrog (citron) that was fried
in honey or sugar, you should recite the berachah Borei peri ha'eitz.

13

Over spoiled fruit, such as, fruit that has become parched by the heat
and has fallen off the tree before becoming ripe, you should say the
berachah, Shehakol. Likewise, over moldy bread or over a slightly
spoiled dish, the berachah, Shehakol, should be said. But if they are
completely spoiled, to the point that they are inedible, then you need
not say any berachah. Similarly, over strong vinegar (which bubbles
when it is poured on the ground), no berachah is said. But if you mix it
with water, and it becomes fit to drink, you should say Shehakol over it.

14

There are types of fruit which never ripen on the tree, but after they are
picked from the tree they are stored [and covered] with straw and chaff
and the like, and in that way they become ripe. Since that is their





natural way of ripening, you recite the berachah, Borei peri ha'eitz, over
them.
15

There are certain kinds of fruit that contain only juice that is
concentrated in their seeds. ([In Yiddish] they are called kolines.) [These
seeds] are not fit to eat; and after the juice is extracted from them they
are thrown away. Over this extraction, you recite Shehakol, (since its
main component is the juice that is extracted from it, in no way can it
be considered a fruit). Even if you eat the skin and the seeds as well,
you still should only say Shehakol.

16

We say neither the berachah Borei peri ha'eitz nor Borei peri ha'adamah
unless we can at least slightly recognize the fruit. But if they are so
crushed that they are unrecognizable, as for example, prune paste
(lekvar) which is made of cooked prunes, or mashed peas, etc., then we
say Shehakol over them. But if, after the fact, you said the berachah that
was appropriate for their kind, you have fulfilled your obligation.
However, if the accepted way of eating these fruits is in a crushed form,
by completely mashing them, then you say even initially the berachah
that was meant for them.

17

Over rice and millet that have been cooked, if they have not been
mashed, you say the berachah, Borei peri ha'adamah. But if they were
mashed or ground [into flour], and you made bread out of them, there
is a difference between rice and millet. [Technically], according to the
law, over rice, you should say Borei minei mezonos, and the berachah,
Shehakol, over millet; but we are not certain whether the Hebrew word
orez means rice, and the Hebrew word dochan means millet, [or vice
versa]. Therefore, a God fearing person should eat mashed millet and





rice only as part of a meal. However, in an emergency, if you have no
bread, you should say over both rice and millet, the berachah, Shehakol,
and the after-berachah Borei nefashos rabbos. Over bread made of
cornmeal, even in places where such bread is the staple food, the
berachah, Shehakol should be recited.
18

Over sugar you say the berachah, Shehakol. Likewise, if you chew sugar
cane, you say Shehakol. Also [over] cinnamon and licorice that you
chew and only enjoy the flavor, and you discard the substance, you say
the berachah, Shehakol.
"
"1

When fruits and vegetables are squeezed and juice extracted from them,
you should say Shehakol over the juice. The same is true of honey that is
extracted from dates; because the only juice that is called fruit is wine
and olive oil. Because wine is highly regarded a special berachah, Borei
peri hagafen, was designated for it. Olive oil is also held in high esteem,
and if you enjoy it in such a manner that you would have to say a
berachah over it, you recite the berachah, Borei peri ha'eitz.

2

When you cook fruits that are usually eaten in their raw state, you say
the berachah, Shehakol, over the sauce. However, fruits which are
usually dried first and then cooked, —if they are plentiful, and [also]
grown for that purpose, this is the halachah: if they were cooked in
order to eat the fruit, and to drink the juice, you recite Borei peri
ha'eitz, over the juice even if you do not eat the [pieces of ] fruit.
Likewise, in the case of legumes and vegetables, which are eaten after
they are cooked, when the soup is also eaten, this is the halachah: over





the soup you say the berachah, Borei peri ha'adamah, even if you do not
eat the solid food. (Now the difference between this case and the case
discussed in paragraph 1, [can be attributed], according to some
authorities, to the fact that in the case mentioned in par. 1, it is not
customary to squeeze the fruits or the vegetable in order to extract
liquid from them, whereas in this case, [cooking] is the accepted
method [to obtain the liquid]. (Other authorities suggest [as an
alternative reason], [that in the case discussed in this paragraph] there is
a greater input of the flavor of the fruit or the vegetable into the water
in which they are cooked than in the juice that is squeezed out of
them.) But if they are only cooked for the sake of the fruit or the
vegetables, then, if you do not eat any of the fruit or the vegetables but
only drink the juice, you recite the berachah Shehakol. If they are
cooked with meat, although the cooking was done also for the sake of
the soup, you still say Shehakol over the soup, because the meat is the
main part [of the dish].
3

If you soak or cook fruits exclusively for the sake of their juice, you say
the berachah, Shehakol [over the juice]. Consequently, the berachah you
should say over coffee or tea is Shehakol. Also over beer, whether made
from dates or from barley, [you should recite the berachah Shehakol].

4

If vegetables or fruits are preserved in water for the purpose of pickling
although they are usually processed that way, (as, for example,
cucumbers, squash, beets, and cabbage) nevertheless, over their juice
you say only the berachah, Shehakol. Although the juice has the same
flavor as the vegetables or the fruit, nevertheless, since the purpose of
the pickling is not to flavor the water, but in order that their own
[quality and taste] be improved by the pickling, you only say the





berachah, Shehakol. Nevertheless, if you first ate the vegetables and said
Borei peri ha'adamah, and afterwards you wanted to drink the juice, it is
questionable if you have to say a berachah over it, for perhaps the
berachah Borei peri ha'adamah exempted the juice also. Therefore, do
not partake of juice in this manner.
5

Likewise, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and the like which are cooked in a
liquid that has a taste of its own, as, for instance, [when they are
cooked] in vinegar, borscht (beet soup), or milk, you say the berachah,
Shehakol. over the liquid. But if you first ate the fruit, [and said the
berachah] it is questionable whether or not the liquid is exempt with
the recitation of this berachah.




6


Some raisins have so much juice that when they are pressed juice will
ooze out. If they were crushed and soaked in water for the purpose of
making a beverage out of them, and not for eating the raisins, and they
were soaked for three days and began to ferment, and after the three
days the liquid is poured into another vessel, such liquid is considered
real wine. Its berachah is Borei peri hagafen, and the after-berachah is
the ""three-faceted berachah."" On all occasions where a cup of wine is
required, you may fulfill your obligation [with this beverage]. You must
see to it, however, that the raisins comprise more than one sixth part of
the water. Now when you estimate [the volume] of the raisins, consider
them as though they were fresh before they were dried. These guidelines
only apply to wine made by soaking raisins as indicated above; but if
the raisins were boiled in water, the boiling does not turn them into
wine. (Soaking or boiling the raisins, for the purpose of eating the
raisins as well, raises many questions as to the proper berachah to be
said over the liquid.)

If you eat two articles of food, or you eat and drink, one of which is
primary to you while you regard the other as secondary, [that is to say]
you would never have eaten [the secondary food], if you had not
partaken of the primary food, [in other words] if not for the primary
food, you would not have eaten the secondary food at all. For example,
if you feel faint, and, in order to fortify yourself, you eat some herring
or radishes, but since they have a sharp flavor, you also eat a small piece
of bread or something else to soften the sharp taste, or if you crave a
drink of whiskey and you have one, and in order to soften the sharp





taste, you eat a small piece of bread or some fruit afterwards, then you
say the berachah only over the primary food, but over the secondary
food no berachah should be said; neither a preceding, nor a concluding
berachah, because it is exempt with the berachah you recited over the
primary food. Neither does it require the washing of the hands.
2

This rule [regarding secondary food] applies only to a case when you
eat the primary food first and the secondary food later, and at the time
you said the berachah over the primary food, you also had in mind to
eat the secondary food, or you usually eat them in that manner, which
is then considered as though you purposely intended [to exempt the
secondary food with the berachah over the primary]. You must
therefore eat the secondary food in the same place. This rule would be
excluded if you did go to another room before [eating the secondary
food], for then you would have to say a berachah over the secondary
food as well.

3

Similarly, if you eat the secondary food before eating the primary food,
for example, if you wish to drink wine or whiskey, and in order not to
drink it on an empty stomach you first eat a little snack, then you must
also say a berachah over the secondary food. However, since it is only
secondary, some authorities maintain that the berachah was brought
down to a lower level and you say only Shehakol over it; but others
disagree. In order to remove any doubt, you should drink first a little of
the primary food [wine or whiskey], say the berachah over it, and
thereby you exempt the secondary food [from a berachah].

4

If you wish to partake of two articles of food [each for its own sake], for
example, you are going to drink whiskey and also eat some pastry,





honeycake, preserves, or the like, you should say a [separate] berachah
over each; first, the berachah over the cake or the preserves because they
are considered more important and then the berachah over the whiskey.
Especially, if you eat some pastry and also drink coffee, you should say a
separate berachah over each; that is to say, first over the pastry and then
over the coffee, because you had in mind to eat both.
5

[If you eat] two different kinds [of food] that were cooked together, and
each kind is recognizable, you must say over each kind the berachah
that is appropriate for it. But if the foods were mashed and cling
together, we apply the rule of ""follow the majority,"" and that which is
predominant is considered the primary food over which the berachah is
said, and this exempts the secondary food. However, if one kind is of
the five species of grain, even if it is the least in quantity, it is considered
the primary ingredient as I have written. See chapter 48:10.

6

If you add milk or soup to a dish with the intention of eating the two
together, if your main intent is [to eat] the food, then you say the
berachah over that only, since the milk or the soup is only secondary.
But if your intent is primarily the soup or the milk, you recite the
berachah over them, for then the food is secondary. But if you care
equally for both (and each requires a different berachah), you first say
the berachah over the food, eat some of it, and then say the berachah
over the soup or the milk. In this case the ""majority rule,"" [which
dictates that you say the berachah over the food that is in greater
quantity] does not apply. Even if the food consists of a grain product, it
is not considered important in this connection. (Regarding foods boiled
in water or milk see chapters 48 and 53.)




7


In a mixture of ground spices and sugar, the spices are considered the
primary ingredient, thus you should say the appropriate berachah over
them. Over nutmeg, you say Borei peri ha'eitz, over cinnamon Borei peri
ha'adamah, and over ginger, you say Borei peri ha'adamah.

8

If you drink olive oil in its natural state, you say no berachah at all
because it is harmful to your [health], but if you mix [the oil] with
other ingredients it becomes secondary, and you say the berachah only
over the primary ingredient. However, if you are ill and you must drink
[the oil] for medicinal purposes, but in order to prevent its harmful side
effects, you mix it with another substance; since the oil is the primary
element, even if it is less in quantity [than the other ingredient], you
say the berachah over [the oil] which is Borei peri ha'eitz, and thereby
you exempt the other ingredient. If you are thirsty and you drink [a
beverage] to quench your thirst, but, as a supplement, you add olive oil
to it for health reasons, then you say the berachah only over the
beverage. This law applies also if you add muscatels, cinnamon, or
ginger to the beverage, for you must always consider your main
objective.

9

In all kinds of preserves the honey and the sugar are secondary
[ingredients]. You should recite the berachah which is appropriate for
the fruit, which is the primary component. (See Chapter 52 above).
"
"1

If there are several kinds of fruit before you and you wish to eat from all
of them, [observe the following guidelines:] if they are all subject to the





same berachah, you say the berachah over the kind you like best and
find most appealing. If you like all of them equally and there is among
them one of the seven species for which the Land of Israel is praised,
(see Chapter 51:7 above) then say the berachah over that one, even if it
should be only half a fruit while the others are whole ones. But if
among them there are none of the seven species and only one of them is
whole, the whole one takes precedence [and you should say the
berachah over it]. The same rules apply [to fruits] whose berachos are
not similar, for example, if one's berachah is Borei peri ha'eitz while the
other requires the berachah Borei peri ha'adamah. Since, you must say
both berachos, if you prefer one kind you first recite the berachah over
the favorite fruit. If you like them equally, you should first say the
berachah over one of the seven species, even if it is not whole. If there
are none of the seven species among them, the whole one takes
precedence. But if both are whole or both are cut, the berachah, Borei
peri ha'eitz, takes precedence over the berachah, Borei peri ha'adamah.
2

If all the fruits are of the seven species and you like them all equally you
should give precedence [in saying the berachah] to the one mentioned
first in the Biblical verse. And the second time the word eretz is
mentioned in the verse [which lists the seven species] interrupts the
order. Consequently, dates takes precedence over grapes because dates
are mentioned second after the second eretz in that verse, while grapes
are in third place after the first eretz. This applies only to grapes. Since
wine is so important that a special berachah has been ordained for it, it
takes precedence over all kinds of fruit.

3

The precedence that is given to the seven species applies only if the fruit
is ripe, but if the fruit is unripe it has no precedence, because the Torah





does not praise anything that is not suitable. Likewise, if you eat [of the
seven species] in a way that you cannot enjoy it, for instance, if you
would eat wheat in its raw form, the laws of precedence do not apply.
4

If there is before you a kind of food over which the berachah, Borei peri
ha'eitz, or the berachah, Borei peri ha'adamah, is said, and another kind
over which you say Shehakol, and you wish to eat of both kinds, the
berachos, Borei peri ha'eitz and Borei peri ha'adamah, take precedence.
These two berachos are [more] important, because they are more
specific, for they exempt only one particular kind of food; whereas
Shehakol is a berachah that embraces a great number of foods. Even if
the food over which Shehakol is said appeals to you more, nevertheless,
you should give precedence to the berachos Borei peri ha'eitz or Borei
peri ha'adamah.

5

The berachah, Borei minei mezonos, takes precedence even over the
berachah over wine; needless to say that the berachah, Hamotzi, [takes
precedence over wine] for [Hamotzi] takes precedence even over the
berachah, Borei minei mezonos. Therefore, on Shabbos and Yom tov
when you recite the kiddush over wine, you should cover the bread
[Sabbath loaves] so that it should not see its shame when we give
precedence to the wine. Likewise, in the morning, when you recite the
kiddush and then eat a variety of cake and pastry, during kiddush the
cake should be covered while the Kiddush is said.
"
"1

If, by mistake, you said the berachah, Borei minei mezonos, over bread
or you said the berachah, Hamotzi, over cake you have fulfilled your





duty. But if you said [Hamotzi] over cooked food, even [if it is
prepared] from the [five species] of grain, your obligation is not
fulfilled. If, by mistake, you said the berachah, Borei peri hagafen, over
grapes you have fulfilled your duty. Similarly, if in error, you said the
after-berachah, Al hagefen, after [eating grapes], you have done your
duty, because grapes are also fruit of the vine.
2

If, by mistake, you said the berachah, Borei peri ha'adamah, over fruit of
the tree, or if both [fruits of the tree and of the ground] were before
you, and, by mistake, you first said the berachah over the fruit of the
ground (Ha'adamah) with the intention of exempting the fruit of the
tree, you have fulfilled your obligation, because the tree also draws its
nourishment from the earth. But if you say Borei peri ha'eitz over fruit
of the ground, you have not fulfilled your obligation. Consequently, if
you are in doubt whether a certain fruit is a fruit of the tree or a fruit of
the ground, and it is impossible for you to determine [its nature], then
you should recite over it Borei peri ha'adamah.

3

If, by mistake, you said the berachah, Borei peri ha'eitz, over wine, and
you notice [your error] immediately, you should add at once Borei peri
hagafen. But if you did not notice [your error] immediately, you have
fulfilled your duty, since it is after the fact.

4

Over any article of food, even over bread or wine, if, by mistake, you
recited the berachah Shehakol, you have fulfilled your obligation.

5

Although, initially, you should ascertain [the nature of the food] over
which you are about to say the berachah (as mentioned in Chapter
50:3), nevertheless, if your intention was in error, for example, if you





take a cup, thinking that it contains wine, and you begin the berachah
with the understanding that the cup contains wine, but before saying
the words Borei peri hagafen, you discover that it holds water or beer,
and you conclude with Shehakol ni'yah bidevaro, you need not repeat
the berachah, because, for mistaken intention, you do not need to
repeat a berachah. Even more so, if your error would be reversed, in
that you have the mistaken impression that [the cup] contains beer or
water, and you begin the berachah with the intention of ending it with
Shehakol, but before saying Shehakol, you discover [that the cup] holds
wine and you conclude with Borei peri hagafen, you have fulfilled your
obligation. After all, even if you had concluded the berachah as you
originally intended, you would have fulfilled your duty.
6

Even if you completed the entire berachah erroneously, but you became
aware [of your mistake] at once and you corrected the recitation; for
example, if you took a glass of water or beer, and, thinking that it is
wine, you said the berachah, Borei peri hagafen and you discovered
immediately that it was water or beer, and you concluded [by saying the
words] Shehakol ni'yah bidevaro, you said in fact: Borei peri hagafen—
shehakol ni'yah bidevaro—you have fulfilled your obligation.

7

If you were not immediately aware [of your error], you must recite the
entire berachah, Shehakol, anew if you wish to drink this glass [of
water]. If you intended to drink wine afterward, you may take some
wine and drink it at once, without saying a second berachah, as long as
you did not interrupt by speaking (see Chapter 50:4, 5 above). [This
rule applies] even though you tasted [the contents of ] the glass and by
tasting it, you discovered that it contains water or beer, nevertheless,





[tasting] is not considered an interruption, since it is a fait accompli—it
is already done. (Regarding kiddush see Ch. 77:12 below)
"
"1

When you recited the berachah over bread you had no intention to eat
more than what you had prepared; for instance, you bought bread or a
roll thinking that this would be sufficient, but later you desired to eat
more; and you send someone to buy more of the same. Even if there is
still some left of what you had originally prepared, nevertheless, you
must repeat the berachah Hamotzi over the additional bread, because
this is a change of mind. But if you have bread in the house, and you
cut off one slice thinking that this would be sufficient, but then you
desired to eat more, and you cut off another slice, even if there is
nothing left of the original slice, you need not repeat Hamotzi; for this
is not considered a change of mind, for this is the usual way [of people].

2

If you say a berachah over the fruit which you are eating, and then
some more fruit is served, if at the time you said the berachah, you had
in mind to include all that would be served, then, even if you have
nothing left of the original fruit, and even if [the additional fruit] is not
of the same kind as the first but requires the same berachah, you need
not repeat the berachah over the additional fruit. However, if you
clearly changed your mind, that is to say, your original intention was to
eat only the fruit that was before you, and then you decided to eat
more, in that case, [even if the additional fruit] is of the same kind as
the first, and there is still in front of you some of the original fruit,
nevertheless, you must repeat the berachah over the additional fruit.




3


However, if initially you gave no thought one way or the other [about
any additional fruit that might be served] then the following
distinctions [must be made]: if, at the time the additional fruit is
served, none of the first fruit is left, you must repeat the berachah
[when you eat the additional fruit], however, if there is still some of it
left, it is questionable if a second berachah is necessary over the
additional [fruit]. Therefore, it is advisable that you exercise caution,
when reciting the berachah, to have in mind [to exempt] whatever may
be served later. Now, if you gave no thought [to additional fruit], and
had nothing in mind, since it is questionable if the berachah must be
repeated, you should avoid eating [the additional fruit].

4

If [additional] fruit is served, that is, of a superior kind, and it is more
appealing to you than the first, or if the additional fruit belongs to the
seven species, even if some of the first fruit is still left, you must repeat
the berachah over the additional fruit, [because the berachah recited
over] a lesser article of food does not exempt a superior one
automatically, unless you clearly intended to do so.

5

If you say the berachah [Shehakol] over beer, with the intention that the
berachah should exempt all other articles of food that require the
berachah, Shehakol, and then fish is brought [to the table], you need
not repeat the berachah over the fish. [If, however, when saying the
berachah,] you did not think [about any food that might be served
later], then, even if at the time the fish is served there is still some beer
left, you must say the berachah over the fish. This case cannot be
compared to the case of the [different] fruits, where, even though one
of the fruits is an apple and the other nuts, both belong to the same





category of food, whereas, beer and fish are two entirely different kinds
of food, one is food, the other a beverage. [Even though both require
the berachah Shehakol] the one cannot exempt the other, unless they are
both on the table when you recite the berachah, or you had the
intention to exempt it.
6

The above rules apply only to a person who eats his own food, but if
you eat a meal at someone else's house, the berachah you say over one
kind of food, exempts all that is being served even if there is no more
left of the first course, since [a guest] submits to the host's wishes. But
if you actually change your mind [regarding the additional food] then
you must repeat the berachah. If the host had no intention to serve
more [of the same food], and he only offered it at the request of his
guests, even then they need not repeat the berachah, because guests
assume that in all likelihood the host will serve them with all the food
they desire.

7

If you come to a meal where you are served a beverage, and you recited
the berachah over it, and later you are offered more of the same; if it is
the general custom [to serve drinks continually], it may be assumed
that you intended to include all the drinks [with the first berachah] and
you need not repeat it.
"
"1

Just as we are forbidden to enjoy food or drink before reciting a
berachah, so are we forbidden to enjoy any fragrant scent before
reciting a berachah. As it is said, ""Let every soul praise God."" And what
is it that only the soul enjoys and from which the body derives no





pleasure? It is the fragrant scent. However, after enjoying [the
fragrance], you need not say a concluding berachah, for as soon as the
fragrance ceases, your enjoyment ceases, and it is the same as food that
has already been digested.
2

What berachah do you say over a pleasant fragrance? If the fragrance
comes from a fruit that can be eaten, whether it is a fruit of a tree or a
fruit of the ground, even if it can be eaten only when mixed [with other
ingredients] such as nutmeg or a lemon or an esrog (citron) (all year
round, except during the festival of Sukkos, as explained in Chapter
137:7), nevertheless, since this fruit is used mainly as food, you recite
over it the berachah Asher nasan [Who gave] (some say: Hanosein)
(Who gives …) rei'ach tov bapeiros [a fragrant scent into fruit]. [You say
this berachah] only when you intentionally inhale it. But if your mind
was not on smelling the fragrance, but you intended only to eat the
fruit, and the fragrance reached you unintentionally, you need not say
the berachah over the fragrance. If you smell roasted coffee, which has a
pleasant scent, you say the berachah Asher nasan rei'ach tov bapeiros.

3

If the thing from which the fragrance emanates is a tree or a tree-like
plant, you say the berachah Borei atzei vesamim [Who has created
fragrant woods]. Therefore, over myrtle, roses, frankincense and the
like, you say Borei atzei vesamim. Since the main feature of these is not
their food value, but rather their fragrance, they are not considered
fruit. Regarding pepper and ginger, some authorities hold that they
require a berachah, whereas according to others, no berachah should be
said. Therefore, you should not smell [pepper and ginger].




4


[If the fragrance emanates] from grass or herbs you should recite Borei
isvei vesamim [Who has created fragrant herbs]. (The letter ayin of isvei)
is vocalized with a short i, the letter beis [of isvei] is pronounced as a
veis. Likewise, the beis of vesamim is pronounced as a veis because it
follows a yud, (the last letter of isvei) and the first letter of a word that
follows an alef hei, vav, or yud never carries a dagesh. The characteristic
feature that tells the difference between a tree and an herb is this: if its
stalk is as hard as the stalk of flax and is perennial and produces leaves,
it is a tree, but if the stalk is always soft, it is an herb.

5

If it is neither a tree nor an herb, but like musk, [when you inhale its
fragrance] you recite the berachah Borei minei vesamim, [Who has
created various kinds of fragrances]. Likewise, [when you smell dried
mushrooms, if they have a pleasant scent, it seems to me that you
should also say the berachah Borei minei vesamim.

6

Balsam oil which grows in the Land of Israel, enjoys a prominence as a
product of the Land of Israel, and a special berachah has been instituted
for it, which reads: Borei shemen areiv [Who has created pleasantscented oil].

7

[If, by mistake] you said over a fragrance from a tree the berachah Borei
isvei vesamim, or, conversely, [over fragrances from herbs, you said atzei
vesamim], you have not fulfilled your obligation. But if you say Borei
minei vesamim over any of the [fragrant] species, you have fulfilled your
obligation. Therefore, if you are in doubt, regarding any species, as to
what berachah to say, and you are unable to determine its classification,
you should say the berachah Borei minei vesamim. It seems to me that if





you said the berachah Borei atzei vesamim on smelling the fruit of a
tree, you have fulfilled your duty. Therefore, it seems to me, that on
smelling cloves, orange peel, and lemon peel, you should say Borei atzei
vesamim.
8

Oil or water that was scented with spices from fragnrant wood (which
are still in the oil or water), require the berachah Borei atzei vesamim.
But [if the oil or water was scented] with fragrant herbs, you say [when
smelling it] Borei isvei vesamim. If it was perfumed with both wood and
herbs, you should say Borei minei vesamim. In all cases where the
fragrance is a blend of several components, you should recite Borei
minei vesamim. If the scent-producing substances were removed from
the oil or the water, it is questionable whether a berachah is needed
because the main ingredients are absent. Therefore, you should refrain
from smelling [this kind of fragrance].

9

If fragrant fruit is set before you together with scented wood, herbs, and
spices, you should say over each the berachah that is appropriate to it
[in the following order:] first you say the berachah over the fruit, then
over the wood, then over the herbs, and, finally, the berachah over the
spices.

10

[If you smell] incense, i.e., spices burnt on coals which produces
aromatic fragrances, you should say the berachah as soon as the fumes
rise, before inhaling the aroma, as is the rule with all berachos said over
articles for human enjoyment. However, you should not say the
berachah before the fumes rise, for a berachah must be recited
immediately before the enjoyment. If the incense consists of fragrant
wood, you should recite Borei atzei vesamim; if it consists of herbs, isvei





vesamim, if it is made up of other kinds [of spices], you should say Borei
minei vesamim, You should say the berachah only when you bum the
incense especially in order to smell its aroma, but if incense is burned in
order to deodorize [a room], as in the case where aromatic substances
are placed near a corpse, no berachah should be said.
11

All spices that are not meant specifically for smelling such as spices that
are stored in a room as merchandise and perfume used only to scent
garments, and not meant to be smelled for its fragrance, but only to
give a fresh scent to the garments, require no berachah, even when you
smell them intentionally.

12

However, if you enter a store that sells spices, or a pharmacy, and you
intend to smell them, you should say Borei minei vesamim, since the
spices in the store are displayed in order to be smelled, as this is the
shopkeeper's interest, for the aroma will make people buy [the spices].
If you keep going in and out of the store, [and when you first said the
berachah,] you had in mind to return to the store, you need not repeat
the berachah. But if you were distracted or you stayed away a long time
from the store or you visited another store, you must repeat the
berachah when you return.

13

Scents that emanate from objects other than the original source, such as
from garments that have been perfumed, or from a vessel that
contained spices and absorbed their scent, or from your hands after you
handled esrogim (citrons), or other fragrant fruit, require no berachah.

14

Chapter 152:8 mentions the law which states that it is forbidden to
smell perfumes created for women, and Chapter 167:7 mentions the





law according to which it is forbidden to smell the incense which was
burned for idol worship. Needless to say, that it is forbidden to say a
berachah over them.
"
"1

If you receive good tidings from a reliable eye-witness, and needless to
say, if you witness the event yourself, if you are the only one who
benefits from the tidings, you recite the berachah Shehecheyanu [Who
kept us in life]. But if it is good for you and others as well, you say the
berachah Baruch ata Adonoy Elokeinu melech ha'olam hatov vehameitiv,
[Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the universe Who is good
and does good]. In other words, He is good to you and He also does
good to your fellow man. If at the time that you see or hear the tidings,
you are unable to utter the berachah, either because of your physical
condition or because of the place where you happen to be, then you
may recite the berachah later. This rule applies also to the berachah
Dayan ha'emes [the true Judge] [which is said over bad tidings].

2

It is our duty to express our blessing to Hashem, blessed be His Name
even on bad tidings, as it is said: ""Love Hashem, your God, with all
your heart, with all your soul and with all your possessions."" ""With all
your heart"" means with your two inner drives, with the good and the
bad inclination. (that is, even when you are engaged in worldly
pursuits, you should fulfill the command: ""Affirm Him in all your
undertakings."" See Chapter 31 above). ""With all your soul"" [means]
even if He takes away your life. ""With all your possessions"" means with
all your resources. Another meaning of the words uvechol me'odecha is





with any measure that He metes out to you, whether it is a measure of
goodness or a measure of punishment, express your gratitude to Him.
What berachah should be said? Upon hearing bad tidings, the berachah
said is: Baruch ata Adonoy Elokeinu melech ha'olam dayan ha'emes,
[Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the universe, the true
Judge]. If many tidings are received at the same time, whether good or
evil, one berachah is sufficient for all. The blessing for adversity must be
expressed in a spirit of unquestioning acceptance as is done when good
tidings arrive, as it is said, ""Of kindness and judgment will I sing, to
You, Hashem, will I sing."" If you bestow kindness on me, I will sing,
and if You render judgment, I will, likewise, sing. Because an evil fate,
too, to the true servant of God is a source of joy and a favor, since [the
believer] willingly accepts whatever God has decreed, firmly convinced
that his suffering is an atonement for his sins. Thus, in accepting this
misfortune he is, in fact, serving God, and serving God is a source of
joy to him.
3

If something fortunate happens to someone or he receives good news,
even though it is likely that this benefit will give rise to evil, as when he
finds a precious object, and, if the king were to discover this fact, he
would confiscate all his possessions; nevertheless, he should say Hatov
vehameitiv. So, also, if disaster strikes or someone receives bad news,
even though, most probably this adversity will turn to his advantage, as
when his fields are flooded, and his crops are ruined, but the subsiding
flood water is of great benefit to him because it waters his fields,
nevertheless, he should say Dayan ha'emes, since berachos are not made
for future events. [A berachah is said] only over something that occurs
here and now.




4


You should accustom yourself to say always: ""Whatever the Almighty
does is for good.""

5

When the wife gives birth to a son, the father says the berachah Hatov
vehameitiv. The mother, too, should say this berachah. If the mother
dies in childbirth, the father says Shehecheyanu, because the good has
come only to him. Likewise, if the father dies before she gives birth, she
recites Shehecheyanu (when the child is born).

6

Upon the death of a father or other relative, or even an unrelated,
observant Jew, and certainly [on the death of ] a Torah scholar whose
death distresses us, we recite the berachah Baruch ata Adonoy Elokeinu
melech ha'olam dayan ha'emes. On the death of a person whose demise
does not cause as much anguish, Baruch dayan ha'emes should be said,
omitting the Divine Name and Kingship. If a father leaves property to
his son as an inheritance, the son also says the berachah Shehecheyanu.
If there are other brothers who share the inheritance, then, instead of
Shehecheyanu, he says Hatov vehameitiv.

7

If you built or bought a house or you bought vessels or valuable clothes,
even if you already own similar possessions, as long as you have never
owned these objects, (this excludes objects you sold and then bought
back) and you take pleasure in owning them, you say the berachah
Shehecheyanu. The berachah should be recited at the time you make the
purchase or upon the completion of the building, even though you
have not yet made use of them, for the berachah is said over the
happiness you experience when you acquire them.




8


When you put on a new garment [for the first time] you say the
berachah Malbish arumim [Who clothes the naked]. Even though you
have said Malbish arumim in your morning prayers, you repeat it when
you put on [your new clothes]. However, if you had the new garment
on in the morning, the berachah in the morning prayers exempts you
[from saying it again]. Some authorities hold that when you buy a hat,
and you wear it [for the first time], you should say the berachah Oteir
Yisrael besif'arah [Who crowns Israel with splendor], and when putting
on a new belt you say Ozeir Yisrael bigevurah [Who girds Israel with
strength]. Other authorities disagree with this opinion. Therefore, it is
best to put them on for the first time in the morning, [and to have in
mind] to exempt them when you say those berachos [in your morning
prayers]. If you buy a new tallis, then, after you tie the tzitzis to it, you
recite the berachah Shehecheyanu. If you did not say it at that time, you
should say it when you wrap yourself in it for the first time, following
the berachah Lehis'ateif batzitzis [to be enwrapped in tzitzis].

9

When you buy articles that will be used by the entire household, you
say the berachah Hatov vehameitiv.

10

When you receive a gift, you say the berachah Hatov vehameitiv for you
benefit from it and the donor benefits from it as well. If the recipient is
poor, the donor has the satisfaction that the Almighty has enabled him
to give charity, and if the recipient is wealthy, the donor is pleased by
the fact that the rich man accepts his gift.

11

When you buy new sacred books, you need not say Shehecheyanu, as
the things with which you perform mitzvos are not for physical





enjoyment.
12

On purchasing an article of minor value such as a shirt, a pair of shoes,
or socks, you should not recite a berachah. This is true even if the buyer
is a poor man who derives pleasure [from these new possessions]. If a
rich man buys new vessels [or garments] that an average man would be
happy to own but to which a rich man attaches little importance and in
which he finds no joy, he should not say a berachah.

13

It is customary to say to a person who puts on a new garment, ""May
you wear it out and acquire a new one."" [But to someone] who puts on
new shoes or a new garment made of fur or leather, even if the fur or
leather is from an unclean animal and even if the fur or the leather are
only used as lining, do not say ""May you wear it out and acquire a new
one,"" because a new garment like this one requires the killing of a living
creature, and it is written, ""And His mercies are on all His works.""

14

The first time you eat a new fruit from a tree which reproduces
annually, you say the berachah Shehecheyanu. First you say Shehecheyanu
and then the berachah over the fruit. If you forgot and first said the
berachah over the fruit, you may say Shehecheyanu afterwards, and this
is not considered an interruption. But if you failed to say Shehecheyanu
the first time you ate the new fruit, you should not say it [when you eat
the same fruit] later. If there are before you several kinds of new fruit,
one Shehecheyanu is sufficient for all. Concerning two kinds of fruit,
although they slightly resemble each other, such as cherries and small
plums, or even if they are called the same name, but only differ in taste,
such as white figs and black figs, [the rule is] that if you said
Shehecheyanu over one kind and later you wish to eat of the other, you





repeat the berachah Shehecheyanu, since you enjoy [each fruit]
separately.
15

If you said Shehecheyanu over grapes, some authorities hold that you
need not repeat it when you drink new wine, since both are one of the
same pleasure, as wine is made out of grapes. But others hold that even
so, you should say Shehecheyanu over the new wine as well, because
wine gives you greater pleasure than grapes. Therefore, the best course
to follow is, if you already said Shehecheyanu over grapes and then you
wish to drink new wine, that you first say Shehecheyanu over some new
fruit [and keep in mind] to include the wine. But if you have said
Shehecheyanu over new wine, all agree that you need not repeat it over
grapes. This law applies only when you drink new wine [not fully
fermented] that can easily be recognized as new, but if you drink [new
wine] that is fully fermented, even if you have not said Shehecheyanu
over grapes, you do not say Shehecheyanu over [this wine], because you
cannot distinguish between new and old [wine].

16

Over unripe grapes you may not say Shehecheyanu. [This berachah may
be said] only when the clusters are fully ripe; and so must any fruit be
fully ripe, [for a shehecheyanu to be said].

17

It is customary not to say Shehecheyanu over new vegetables or turnips
because they can last a long time by being kept in the ground or in
sand, and also since they are always available, we do not have great
pleasure [when eating the new ones].

18

You should not say Shehecheyanu when you smell a fragrant scent, for
only the soul senses delight from the scent and the soul is eternal.




19


[In the World to Come,] every man will have to answer for all the
[delicacies] his eye beheld which he declined to eat. Rabbi Eleazar
would save small coins and buy everything [at least] once a year and eat
it.

20

When you see a very close friend after a separation of thirty days, and
especially, [when you see] a person who is superior to you, like your
father or teacher, and you take pleasure in seeing him, you should say
Shehecheyanu, even if in the interim, you received a letter from him. If
the separation has been twelve months, you recite Baruch ata Adonoy
Elokeinu melech ha'olam mechayei hameisim. [Blessed are You, Hashem,
our God, King of the universe Who revives the dead] and you do not
say Shehecheyanu. This berachah is made because after twelve months
he was forgotten, just as the dead are forgotten, as it is written, ""I have
been forgotten as a dead man, from the heart, I have become like a
useless vessel."" Just as when a man loses a vessel and does not find it
within twelve months, he gives up hope of ever finding it, so are the
dead forgotten after twelve months.) But if you received a letter from
[your loved one] during the [twelve months'] interval or you had word
concerning his well being, you do not say Mechayei Hameisim but
Shehecheyanu. This applies to men and women alike. Even if a man sees
his wife or his mother, or his sister, or his daughter. or if woman sees
her husband or her father, or her brother, or her son, [in all these cases
Shehecheyanu] should be said.

21

[In the case of ] a friend whom you have never met, but by way of
correspondence with each other you became friends; when you come
together for the first time, you need not say a berachah; for since you





have never seen each other before, face to face your love cannot be so
strong that you should feel true gladness when meeting him.
"
"1

Upon seeing a fruit tree in bloom, you should say: Baruch ata Adonoy,
Elokeino melech ha'olam shelo chiseir be'olamo kelum uvara vo beriyos
tovos ve'ilonos tovim leihanos bahem benei adam, [Blessed are You,
Hashem, our God, King of the universe, Who caused nothing to be
lacking in His universe, and He created in it goodly creatures and
goodly trees, to give mankind pleasure therewith]. You recite this
berachah only once a year. But if you delayed saying the berachah until
the fruit grew, then you should no longer say it. Some authorities hold
that if you neglected to say the berachah when you saw the blossoms
for the first time, you should no longer say it.

2

When you see a meteoric shower, that is shooting stars flashing across
the sky from one place to another in a brilliant streak, or when seeing a
comet that has a bright tail streaming behind it, or on witnessing an
earthquake, or a hurricane, or lightning, on each of these, you say the
berachah Baruch ata Adonoy Elokeinu melech ha'olam osei ma'asei
vereishis, [Blessed are You, Hashem, our God, King of the universe,
Who makes the work of Creation.] (The berachah over a meteor,
should be said no more than once during the night, even if you saw
another meteoric shower. Once you said the berachah over a comet,
you should not repeat it when you see it again within thirty days.) On
hearing thunder after the lightning has flashed, you say: Baruch ata
Adonoy, Elokeinu melech ha'olam shekocho ugevuraso malei olam, [Blessed





are You, Hashem, our God, King of the universe, for His strength and
His power fill the universe]. If you see lightning and hear thunder at
the same time, you say only the berachah, Osei ma'asei vereishis. If on
seeing lightning, you said the berachah Osei ma'asei vereishis and
immediately after the lighting, you hear thunder, you must not say the
berachah over [the thunder] for the berachah over the lightning
exempts it. The berachah over lightning and thunder should be said the
moment they occur, but if there is a brief interruption, the berachah
should not be said any more.
3

As long as the clouds have not scattered, one berachah exempts all [the
lightning and thunder that may occur]. But if the clouds dispersed and
the skies became clear between thunder claps and lightning flashes, you
must repeat the berachah. A flash of lightning unaccompanied by
thunder, [i.e., lightning] that is caused by the heat, is not considered
real lightning and requires no berachah.

4

When you see a rainbow you say: Baruch ata Adonoy Elokeinu melech
ha'olam zocheir haberis vene'eman biveriso vekayam bema'amaro, [Blessed
are You, Hashem, our God, King of the universe, Who remembers the
covenant, is trustworthy in His covenant and fulfills His word]. It is
forbidden to gaze too much at a rainbow.

5

When you see great seas or tall mountains which are famous for their
great height, you say: Osei ma'asei vereishis.

6

When you see the sun at the end of its cycle, that is, after a period of
twenty-eight years, when the vernal equinox of the month of Nisan
occurs at the beginning of Tuesday night, then you should say on





Wednesday morning, when the sun is shining [and visible], Baruch ata
Adonoy Elokeinu melech ha'olam osei ma'asei vereishis. Before saying this
berachah, you should recite Psalm 148 ""Halleluyah! Praise Hashem
from the heavens …,"" and then say the berachah. After that say the
prayer Keil Adon [God the Master] up to vechayos hakodesh [and the
holy Chayos], followed by Psalm 19 ""The heavens declare the glory of
God …"" You conclude with Aleinu leshabei'ach [It is our duty to praise]
and Kaddish.
7

It is best to say this berachah [early] in the morning, immediately after
sunrise, because ""The diligent perform all mitzvos promptly."" It is best,
if possible, to say it in an assembly of people for it is written: ""In the
multitude of people is the king's glory."" (An announcement should be
made on the day before to inform the public of the gathering). But if it
is impossible to call an assembly for early in the morning, the berachah
should not be postponed because of that. Rather, each person should
say it immediately when he sees the rising sun. The rule that ""The
diligent do mitzvos promptly"" takes precedence [over the rule that] ""In
the multitude …"" If you have not said the berachah in the morning,
you may still say it until the third hour of the day and in case of an
emergency [you may say it] until noon. Therefore, if [the sky] is cloudy
in the morning, and [the sun] is obscured, you should wait until it is
near noon, perhaps the sun will by then appear, and you will be able to
say the berachah mentioning God's Name and Kingship. But if the sun
did not appear by then, you should say the berachah omitting the
Name and Kingship. (The most recent kiddush hachamah occurred in
the year 5741/1981. May we merit to live and see the light of the seven
days of Creation.)




8


If, on your behalf, the Holy One, blessed is He, performed a miracle
[by saving your life] in a supernatural way and you see the place where
this miracle took place, you say Baruch ata Adonoy Elokeinu melech
ha'olam she'asa li neis bamakom hazeh, [Blessed are You, Hashem, our
God, King of the universe, Who performed a miracle for me at this
place]. Even a son or a grandson, even those who were born before the
miracle occurred should also say the berachah. What is the wording of
this berachah? A son says: She'asa neis le'avi bamakom hazeh. [Who
performed a miracle for my father at this place]. If there is more than
one son, they say le'avinu (for our father) [instead of le'avi]. A grandson
says la'avosai (for my ancestors), and if there is more than one
grandson, they say la'avoseinu (for our ancestors). A person who
experienced many miracles, and he arrives at one of the places, where a
miracle occurred to him, should mention all the other places and
include them all in one berachah as follows: She'asa li neis bamakom
hazeh uvemakom peloni. [Who performed a miracle for me at this place
and at such and such place]. His son and grandson should also mention
all the other places.

9

When you see an outstanding Torah scholar in Israel, you should say:
Baruch ata Adonoy Elokeinu melech ha'olam shechalak meichochmaso
lirei'av,[Blessed are You, Hashem, our God, King of the universe Who
has apportioned of His knowledge to those who fear him]. (Because
Israel is God's portion and clings to Him, the term ""apportioned"" is
used.) When you see an outstanding scholar, renowned for secular
knowledge, who is a gentile, you say: Baruch ata Adonoy Elokeinu
melech ha'olam shenasan meichochmaso levasar vadam, [Who has given
of his wisdom to human beings].




10


When you see a king of any of the nations of the world, you say:
Baruch ata Adonoy Elokeinu melech ha'olam shenasan mikevodo levasar
vadam, [Blessed are You, Hashem, our God, King of the universe, Who
has given of His glory to human beings]. Even if you do not see the
king in person, but you witness the spectacular pageantry and you are
certain of the king's presence, you may recite this berachah. A blind
person should say the berachah omitting the divine Name and
Kingship. It is a mitzvah to make an effort to behold the glory of kings.
But if you have seen him once, you should not stop your [Torah]
studies to see him again unless he appears later with a greater military
parade and a more majestic display than before.

11

When you see graves of Jews, you should say: Baruch ata Adonoy
Elokeinu melech ha'olam asheryatzar eschem badin … [Blessed are You,
Hashem, King of the universe, Who has formed you in judgment etc.]
When you see the graves of pagans, you say: [the verse in Jeremiah
50:12 ] ""Your mother will be deeply ashamed, she that gave birth to you

will be disgraced. Behold, the ultimate end of nations will be a desert, a
dry land, and a wilderness.""
12

If you see the same phenomenal sights again, you should not repeat the
berachah, unless [at least] thirty days have elapsed since you last saw it.
You do not count the day you saw it, and if you exclude the day you see
it again there are thirty days you may make the berachah. But if you see
different individuals [who hold the same high public office] as those
whom you have seen previously, as, for instance, another king, or [you
see] other graves, or the like, then you should repeat the berachah even
within thirty days.




13


When you see an African, or an Indian, that is, a person of deep red
[skin] color, or an albino, that is, a person with a very pale skin, or a
malformed individual, that is to say, a person who is [abnormally] tall
and slender, or a dwarf or a hidrakonah, that is, a person whose skin is
covered with wart-like scales, or a person with tangled hair, whose
entire hair clings together, or an elephant or an ape, you say: Baruch ata
Adonoy Elokeinu melech ha'olam meshaneh haberiyos, [Blessed are You,
Hashem, our God, King of the universe, Who makes creatures
different]. You say this berachah only [when you see them] the first
time because [then] the strangeness is most striking.

14

The first time you see any of the following you say the beracha
Meshaneh Haberiyes: a crippled person, or an amputee, that is to say, a
person whose hands were amputated, or a blind person, or one afflicted
with open sores, or a person covered with freckles, that is, a person
whose [skin] is speckled with white spots [alternating with brown
spots], if these are birth defects. But if they were afflicted after [birth],
and to see them causes you distress, you say: Baruch dayan ha'emes.

15

When you see beautiful trees, or good-looking creatures, even if it is a
heathen, (by casually glancing at him, since gazing at him is forbidden)
or an animal, you say: Baruch ata Adonoy Elokeinu melech ha'olam
shekachah lo be'olamo. [Blessed are You, Hashem, our God, King of the
universe, Who has such as this in His world]. This berachah is said only
when you see them the first time, and it should not be repeated when
you see them again, or others [of the same kind], unless the latter are
more beautiful than the former.




"

On four [occasions] a person must thank God [for His goodness]; 1]
after crossing the ocean and reaching his destination; 2] after crossing
the desert or any other dangerous road and reaching his destination;
included in this rule is also one who was saved from any other peril, as
when a wall caved in on him or an ox lunged at him, ready to gore him,
or robbers attacked him on the road, or thieves at night and he was
saved from them, or from similar perils; 3] one who suffered from
serious illness or a serious injury or he was confined to bed for [at least]
three days due to an illness and he recovered, his health restored; 4] one
who was in prison even if [he was in prison] only because of monetary
matters and he was released. [The following phrase may serve as] a
mnemonic device: ""All those who are alive thank you, selah."" [The
yisurim —a person suffering [in prison], yam—(crossing the) ocean,
midbar—(crossing the) desert. What berachah should they say? Baruch
ata Adonoy Elokeinu melech ha'olam hagomeil lechayavim tovos
shegemalani kol tov, [Blessed are You, Hashem, our God, King of the
universe, Who bestows good things upon the guilty, Who has bestowed
every goodness upon me]. The listeners should respond: mi
shegemalecha tov hu yigmalecha kol tov selah, [May He Who has
bestowed goodness upon you continue to bestow every goodness upon
you forever].

2

The berachah [Hagomeil] should be said in the presence of ten [male
adults] besides the one who is saying the berachah. Two of them should
be scholars who are engaged in the study of Torah, as it is said: ""Let





them exalt Him in the assembly of the people and praise Him in the
seat of the elders."" But if no scholars are present this should not deter
him [from saying the berachah]. It is customary to say the berachah
[Hagomeil] when called to the reading of the Torah after the concluding
berachah. You should not intentionally delay [saying Hagomeil] longer
than three days. Consequently, if you were saved [from danger] on
Monday [after the Torah was read], you should say Hagomeil
immediately without the Torah scroll, and not wait until [the next
Torah reading on] Thursday. Likewise, if a person is a mourner, who
may not be called to the Torah, he should not wait, but say [Hagomeil]
immediately [after being saved from danger], but he should say it while
standing before ten [male adults], as mentioned above. If it so
happened, that you did delay [saying Hagomeil] longer than three days,
you may still say it afterwards.
3

A person to whom a miracle happened should designate a sum of
money for charity, according to his wealth, and distribute it among
men who are engaged in the study of Torah, and he should say: ""I
hereby give this money to charity. May it be God's will that it will be
counted as if I had brought a thanksgiving offering."" It is also proper
that he should establish some project to benefit the local community;
and every year on the anniversary [of the event], he should privately
thank God, blessed be His Name, and happily tell the story of the
miracle.

4

Before undergoing surgery, or before eating or drinking something [as a
remedy], or taking a treatment for a cure, you should first recite the
following brief prayer: ""May it be Your will Hashem, our God, and the
God of our forefathers that this measure may serve me as a cure, for





You are a gratuitous Healer."" And if the substance which you eat or
drink for medicinal purposes requires that you say a berachah over it
(see Ch. 50:8 above), you should first offer this prayer and then say the
berachah. This seems to me to be the proper order so as not to cause an
interruption between the saying of the berachah and the eating). After
bloodletting, say the following berachah Baruch ata Adonoy Elokeinu
melech ha'olam rofei cholim, [Blessed are You, Hashem, our God, King
of the universe, Who heals the sick].
5

If someone sneezes, you say to him ""To your health,"" and he answers,
""May you be blessed."" Afterwards he says: ""I hope for Your deliverance,
O God,"" for whoever prays for his fellow man has his prayer answered
first.

6

Praying for something that has already happened is a vain, useless
prayer. The following are examples: if a person hears wailing in the
town and says: ""May it be Your will that this cry should not be in my
house;"" or if his wife has become pregnant and forty days after her
conception, he would say the following prayer: ""May it be Your will
that my wife should give birth to a boy."" Such prayers are useless for
what has already happened belongs to the past. However, within the
forty days, this prayer is worthwhile and may be offered. After forty
days he may pray that the child should be a healthy baby, good in the
sight of Heaven and of benefit to mankind.

7

A person who enters his threshing floor to measure his crops, or some
similar activity should recite the following prayer: ""May it be Your will,
Hashem, my God, that you send a blessing on this pile [of grain]. After
he began to measure, he should say, ""Blessed is He Who sends a





blessing on this pile [of grain]"" (omitting the Divine Name and
Kingship). If he had already measured it and then offers a prayer, it is a
vain prayer, because God's blessing is bestowed only on something that
is hidden from view [i.e. of unknown quantity].
8

The first time a Bar Mitzvah is called to the Torah, after he has
concluded the second berachah over [the reading of ] the Torah, the
father says the following berachah: Baruch ata Adonoy Elokeinu melech
ha'olam asher petarani mei'onsho shel zeh [Blessed are You, Hashem, our
God, King of the universe Who has freed me from the punishment due
this boy]. It is a mitzvah for a father to prepare a festive meal on the day
that his son becomes Bar Mitzvah, that is, on the first day of his
fourteenth year. If the boy delivers a Torah discourse, it is considered a
meal for the sake of a mitzvah even if [the banquet] is not given on the
[Bar Mitzvah] day.

9

Berachos are said when a drought occurs, even in our areas where it rains
with [seasonal] regularity and where droughts are rare. If this drought
was so severe, that it caused general distress and then it [finally] rains,
and the rain comes down so heavily that bubbles are formed on the
[flowing] rain water that [seem] to converge, special berachos should be
said.

10

What berachah should be said? Someone who does not own a field says:
""We thank you Hashem, our God, for every drop [of rain] that you
made fall on us, and even if our mouths were full of song as the sea,
etc.,"" (and continue the text of Nishmas) [in the Sabbath morning
service] until ""sanctify and declare the sovereignty of Your Name, our
King. Blessed are You, Hashem, God of many thanksgivings and





praises."" If he owns a field, in partnership with another Jew, he says the
berachah Hatov vehameitiv, but if he has no Jewish partner, even if he
has a wife and children, he says the berachah Shehecheyanu. The
berachos Hatov vehameitiv and Shehecheyanu may be said even if you do
not see the rain but hear it coming down. But the berachah Modim
anachnu [We thank You] should only be said if you actually see the
rain.
"
"1

You should be extremely careful not to deceive your fellow man. If
anyone deceives his fellow, whether a seller deceives a buyer, or a buyer
deceives a seller, he transgresses a negative commandment, for it is said:
""When you sell something to your neighbor, or buy from your
neighbor, do not deceive one another."" The first question a person is
asked when he is brought before the [Heavenly] Court is: ""Have you
[always] been honest in your dealings?""

2

Just as deception is forbidden in buying and selling, so is it forbidden in
hiring, in working on contract, and in money changing.

3

If a person is candid in his dealings, he will not be guilty of deception.
How is this to be understood? [He says to his neighbor:] ""I bought this
article at this and this price and I want to make a profit of so much and
so much."" Even though he was deceived [overpaid] when he bought
[the article], and having been deceived does not entitle a person to
deceive others, nevertheless, he is permitted [to sell it] this way. Because
[his statement] makes it clear [to the buyer] that the price does not





reflect the value of the article, rather, it is based on the price which he
[the seller] paid for it.
4

If a person has something to sell, he is forbidden to make it look better
than it really is in order to mislead [the buyer]. Examples of this are:
giving an animal bran-water to drink which makes it swell up and
makes its hair stand up so that it appears fat [and healthy], or putting a
fresh coat of paint on old utensils to make them look new. All similar
procedures [are forbidden].

5

Likewise, it is forbidden to mix a little bad fruit with a lot of good fruit,
and to sell all of them as good fruit or to mix a low-grade beverage with
a better grade. But if the taste of the [blended] beverage can [easily] be
recognized, the mixing is permitted because the buyer will detect it
[and will not be cheated].

6

A shopkeeper is permitted to distribute roasted kernels and nuts to
children to get them into the habit of buying from him. He may also
sell below the market price to attract customers, and the other
merchants cannot prevent him from doing so.

7

Anyone who gives short measure or weight, even to a non-Jew,
transgresses a negative commandment as it is said: ""Do not falsify
measurements, whether in length, weight, or volume,"" (see Ch.182:1, 4
below). The punishment for giving short measure and weight is very
severe, as it is impossible for a person who gives short measure or
weight to repent properly, since he does not know how much and
whom to compensate. Even the active participation in communal
affairs is not considered suitable repentance.




8


It is written: ""You must not keep in your bag two different weights, one
large and one small. You must not keep in your house two different
measures, one large and one small. You must have a full, just weight,
and you must have a full, just measure …"" The words ""your bag"" and
""your house"" appear to be superfluous and our Rabbis, of blessed
memory, explained: ""You shall have no money in your bag."" Why is this
so? Because you had different weights. ""You shall lack the necessities of
life in your house."" Why is this so? Because you had different measures.
But if full, just weight is in your house, then you will have money; and,
similarly, if full and honest measure is in your house, then all your
needs will be filled. Furthermore, our Rabbis of blessed memory
said:""What should a man do to become rich? He should conduct his
business honestly and ask for compassion from the One to Whom
riches belong,"" as it is said: ""Mine is the silver and Mine is the gold.""

9

You should measure and weigh generously. [That is,] you should give
more than the exact quantity as it is said: ""You must have a full, just
measure."" What does the word ""just"" imply? Says the Torah: ""Be just by
giving him some of your own.""

10

You must measure according to the local custom and not deviate from
it. Where it is the custom to give a heaping measure, you should not
give a level measure, even with the buyer's approval who [now] pays less
than the full price; and where it is the custom to give a level measure,
you should not give heaping measure, even when [you], the seller, are
glad to do so and charge more for it, because the Torah is very strict
with regard to fraudulent weights and measures, lest this will create a
pitfall [for others], since a [stranger] may notice the way of measuring





and get the impression that this is the norm in this town; then he, too,
will give such a measure to someone who is also unfamiliar with the
local custom and thus he will deceive him.
11

The leaders of the community are obligated to appoint supervisors who
will inspect the stores, and anyone found to have deficient measures or
deficient weights or defective scales may be punished and fined as they
see fit.

12

A person is forbidden to keep short measures in his house or in his store
even if he does not use them. Anyone who keeps them, transgresses a
negative commandment, as it is said: ""You must not keep in your bag
two different weights, one large and one small. You must not keep in
your house two different measures, one large and one small."" Even to
use such a [deficient] measure for a urinal (chamber pot) is forbidden,
lest someone unknowingly uses it for measuring [purposes]. However, if
it is the rule in the community to use only measures that are stamped
with a well-known mark, and this [measure] is not stamped, then it
may be kept.

13

If someone seeks to buy or rent something whether real property or
movable goods from a non-Jew or from a Jew, and they [already] agreed
on a price and before they completed the sale, someone else [outbid
him] and bought or rented it, the latter is called a rasha, a wicked
person. But if they have not yet agreed on a price, then, someone else
may buy [or rent] it. We are forbidden to infringe on our neighbor's
rights in the matter of renting houses from a non-Jew.




14


If a person gives money to someone [to act as his agent] to buy real
property or movable goods for him and the agent purchased the object
for himself, with his own money, [he may keep the object, but] he is a
swindler. But if he bought it with the principal's money, he must
convey it to [the principal], even if he the agent intended] to buy it for
himself.

15

If anyone gave a deposit on a purchase, or he marked the article [for
identification] in the seller's presence, or if the seller said to him: ""Mark
your purchase,"" even though, through such action, the buyer does not
acquire title to the article, nevertheless, if one of the parties backs out,
whether the buyer or the seller, he does not behave as a Jew should, and
he is liable to Divine punishment. A curse is invoked against him in
court, as follows: ""He Who punished the generation of the Flood, and
the generation of the Tower of Babel, and the people of Sedom and
Amorah, and the Egyptians who drowned in the sea, may He punish
the one who does not keep his word.""

16

A man has the moral obligation to keep his word even though he gave
no deposit as yet, nor did he mark the article, nor was the transaction
completed. [If the parties] agreed on the price neither [the buyer nor
the seller] may back out. Whoever retracts whether buyer or seller is
guilty of acting in bad faith, and the spirit of the Sages do not look
kindly on him, for a Jew should keep his word, as it is written, ""The
remnant of Israel shall not commit injustice nor speak lies."" [In
addition], a God fearing man should carry out even his unspoken
decisions. If he decided to sell a certain article at a certain price and the
buyer, not knowing [the seller's] innermost thoughts, offered him





more, he should only accept from him the amount he had [originally]
decided to charge, fulfilling the verse that states: ""And speaks the truth
within his heart."" The same rule applies to a buyer; if he decided to buy
an article at a certain price, he may not change his mind. This rule
applies to all matters in relationships between man and his neighbor. If
he decided to do a certain favor [to someone] and is able to do it, he
should fulfill his intention. But regarding his personal needs, if it does
not involve the performance of a mitzvah, he need not fulfill even
[intentions] expressed with his lips.
17

Likewise, if a person promises someone a small gift and he depends on
it being sure that it will be given to him. If the donor changes his mind
and does not give it, he is considered lacking in honesty. But [if he
promised] a large gift [and then changed his mind], he is not
considered lacking in honesty, as the [prospective recipient] did not
depend on it. Nevertheless, at the time that he promises to make a gift,
he has to act in good faith and not have the intention of changing his
mind; for to say one thing, while thinking the opposite is forbidden by
the Torah, as it is said, ""You must have a just eifah and just hin."" Why
does the Torah mention a just hin? Is not hin included in the term eifah
[both are units of measurement]? [Our Sages explain:] ""Let your hein
(yes) be just and let your ""no"" be just."" The above-mentioned law
[refers to a promise made] to a rich man, but if someone makes a
promise to a poor man whether [he promised] a small gift or a large
gift, he may not legally change his mind, because [his promise] is
considered as a vow. Even [if he did not verbally express his promise]
but only made up his mind that he would give, he must carry out his
intention.




18


If a person wishes to sell land or a house and two [prospective buyers]
come, each of them saying: ""I am willing to pay the price,"" and neither
owns land adjacent to the property [offered for sale], these rules should
be followed: If one of them is a fellow townsman and the other comes
from another town, the fellow townsman has the preference. If they are
both fellow townsmen, but one of them is his neighbor, the neighbor
has the preference. If the other person is the [seller's] friend who visits
him often, while his neighbor never visits him, the [seller's] friend has
the preference. If one of them is a friend and the other is a relative, the
friend has the preference, for it is said: ""A neighbor who is near is better
than a brother far off."" But with reference to all other people, a relative
has the preference. The exception is a Torah scholar, who has preference
even over a neighbor and a friend who visits regularly. However, if one
of the [prospective buyers] owns land adjacent to the property [offered
for sale], he has preference over all [the others]. Even after [the seller]
sold it to someone else, the owner of the adjacent property has the right
to pay the purchase price to the buyer and make him yield [the
property]. Even if this buyer is a Torah scholar or he is the seller's
neighbor or relative, and the adjacent owner is an unlearned person and
not related to the seller, the adjacent owner has the preference and can
force the buyer to surrender the property. All the above-mentioned
rules of preference were instituted by the Sages, in order to fulfill the
mandate written [in the Torah]: ""Do what is upright and good in the
eyes of Hashem, your God.""
"
"



1


Just as it is forbidden to deceive a person by [dishonest] buying and
selling, so is it forbidden to deceive a person with words, as it is said:
""And you shall not deceive one another, but you shall fear your God.""
This refers to ""deception done by means of words."" The sin of
deceiving someone with words is greater than deceiving him in money
matters, because [misappropriated funds] can be returned but no
amends can be made for pain inflicted with [hurtful] words. [Monetary
deception] only affects [the victim's] finances, whereas [hurtful or
insulting remarks] are aimed at his person. Anyone who cries [to God]
because of wrong done to him with words is answered immediately. A
person must be particularly careful not to hurt his wife's feelings and
not to cause her pain with [harsh] words, for a woman is sensitive by
nature, and even a slight hurt will bring tears to her eyes. And God,
blessed be He, pays heed to tears, for the gates of tears are never closed.

2

What is meant by hurting someone with words? A person should not
say to someone: ""For how much will you sell this article?"" when he has
no intention of buying it. To someone who wishes to buy grain, he
should not say: ""Go to so and so,"" knowing full well that this person
has [no grain] to sell. If his neighbor is a ba'al teshuvah, he should not
say to him: ""Remember what you used to do in the past."" If his friend
has to endure great suffering, God forbid, he should not speak to him
like Iyov's friends spoke to Iyov, [who said]: ""Is not your fear of God
your confidence?… Remember, I pray you, who ever perished being
innocent?"" (They spoke to him this way because he rebelled against
Divine Providence and God's Attributes [of Justice]). If someone is
asked a scholarly question, he should not say to a person who is not
knowledgeable in this field: ""How would you answer this question?""





The same applies to all similar situations which would cause heartache
[to others].
3

If a man has a humiliating nickname, although he is used to being
called by that name and is not embarassed by it, yet, if someone has the
intention of humiliating him, he may not call him by this nickname,
because this means hurting him with words.

4

It is forbidden to mislead anyone (meaning, to deceive anyone, even
though no monetary loss results), even if he is a non-Jew. Thus, it is
forbidden to sell to him non-kosher meat under the false pretense that
it is kosher. If someone sells an article that has an imperfection, even
though the article is worth the price for which he sells it, nevertheless,
he must inform the buyer of the imperfection. (In the case of a gift,
however, the questions of deception does not exist.)

5

You should not invite anyone for a meal, when you know that he will
not accept. You should not offer someone a gift, when you are sure that
he will not accept it. And so it is in all similar cases, where a person says
one thing but in his heart he does not mean it, as when he pretends to
show respect to someone, but this does not reflect his true feelings,
[such conduct] is forbidden. Your mouth and your heart should always
be in perfect agreement.
"
"1

Any article of food, that you are forbidden to eat, and the article is used
exclusively as food, even though you are allowed to make use of it, you
may not offer it for sale or use it as security for a loan. Even buying it to





feed your non-Jewish worker is prohibited. But if it is something that is
not used for food, such as horses and donkeys, you may do business
with them. You may also deal in the forbidden fat of an animal, for it is
said with regard to it: ""You may use [its forbidden fat] for any purpose
you desire.""
2

If, by chance, you happen to acquire a forbidden thing, for example,
while fishing you catch a [ritually] unclean fish in the net, or you find
an animal that died a natural death or an animal that has been killed by
a wild beast in your house, you are allowed to sell it, since you did not
intend [to acquire] it. But you must sell [a living animal] at once and
may not wait until it grows fat in your possession. You may also sell it
through an agent, although the agent will make a profit from [the sale].
But the agent may not buy it outright, for in that case, he would be
doing business [with forbidden merchandise].

3

You are also allowed to collect unclean things as payment for a debt,
but you must sell them at once; for it is forbidden to keep them in
order to make a profit on them. But you are permitted to wait long
enough, so as not to suffer any loss on the capital.

4

It is permitted to deal in articles such as cheeses of non-Jews, whose
consumption is forbidden only by Rabbinical decree.

Preface
""When you lend money to my people, to the poor among you, do not press him for





payment, do not take interest payment from him"" (Ex. 22:24 ).The Torah obligates us
to lend money to one less fortunate than we, but, at the same time, forbids us to
interest that is Scripturally prohibited. The classic case is when the lender stipulates at
the time of the loan that the money is being lent with the condition that it be paid
back with a set rate of interest. It makes no difference how high or how low the rate
may be; in either case, it is ribis deoraisa and the lender must return the interest
payment to the borrower. This holds true even where the borrower willingly agreed to
of ribis."" The Torah prohibited only interest charged for a loan. The Rabbis added a
""pre-loan"" ribis. The borrower sends money or gifts to the lender so that he will lend
lender did not set interest payments at the time of the loan, but the borrower paid
interest at a later date. In cases of ribis derabanan, the Bais Din [Court] does not have
the power to force the lender to return the interest collected, but it is, nevertheless,
preferable in some cases that he do so on his own.The laws of ribis are complex and
this chapter will only touch some of the fundamentals of this important subject. It is,
therefore, extremely advisable that when a question of ribis arises, a competent rabbi,
well-versed in these laws, should be consulted.

It being the nature of man to desire and lust after money, and it being
more likely for man to transgress the prohibition of interest than other
prohibitions concerning money, because where robbery and fraud and
the like [are concerned], the victim usually protects himself against
robbery or fraud. Also, one who wants to rob or defraud another, will
often be inhibited because of shame or because of fear. This is not so




concerning interest, for the borrower willingly pays and is happy that
he has found a place to borrow even with interest. The lender, too,
thinks to himself that he is doing a great favor to the borrower by
enabling him to profit with this money, many times more than the
interest. It is, therefore, very easy for the person to be seduced, Heaven
forbid, by his evil inclination to transgress this prohibition. Therefore,
the Torah was very stringent with this prohibition. And many
prohibitary laws are said concerning it. The lender transgresses six
prohibitory laws, and will not be included in the resurrection of the
dead, for it is said: ""He gave money [in return] for interest and he
accepted interest, he shall not live."" The borrower transgresses three
prohibitory laws. The scribe, the witnesses and the co-signer each
transgress one prohibitory law. [This applies] also [to] the broker who
brought them together or if he was of help to one of them, for instance,
directing the borrower to one from whom he could borrow, or if he
directed the lender to one to whom he could lend, he, too, transgresses
one prohibitory law.
2

One who failed [to observe this prohibition] and collected interest, is
obligated to return it (except where ""pre-loan"" interest and ""after-loan""
interest [are concerned] which are discussed later in paragraph 6).

3

Even if the lender did not stipulate [ribis] with the borrower at the time
of the loan, but, rather, lent him [money] without charge until a
specified time, or where he sold him merchandise on credit until a
specified time, or where there is an obligation of payment in any other
situation, for whatever reason, and when the time for payment arrives
he agrees to some additional payment in order to extend the due date,
this too is considered ribis.




4


Even if the borrower voluntarily makes an additional payment at the
time the loan is repaid, which was never stipulated and he (the
borrower) does not state that he is giving it to him as interest, [this] too
is prohibited.

5

Even if the borrower tells him at the time of the ribis payment that he is
giving it to him as a gift, it is also prohibited to accept it from him. But
if he already accepted the interest from him and then the lender repents
and wants to return it to the borrower, and he the (borrower) waives it
to him, [then] he is permitted [to keep the interest].

6

It is prohibited to pre-pay the ribis or delay it [until after the payment
of the loan]. For example, Reuven desired to borrow money from
Shimon, and sent him a gift in advance, explaining [that he did so] in
order to obtain the loan, or if it was a substantial gift, even though
nothing was said, [nevertheless,] it is as if it were explicitly stated that it
was for the purpose of obtaining the loan. This constitutes ribis
mukdemes. If he [Reuven] borrowed money from him [Shimon] and
repaid the money and then sent him a gift in consideration of the fact
that [Shimon's] money was tied up by him during the loan period, this
is ribis me'ucheres.

7

If one lends money to his friend for a specified time, [with the
understanding that] [the borrower] reciprocate and lend him at another
time, [either] a greater amount for the same period of time or an
equivalent amount for a longer period of time, this is absolute ribis.
[But,] if he lends him money with the condition [that the borrower]
lend him at another time an equivalent amount of money for the same





period of time, some say that this, too, is prohibited, and others say
that it is permitted. It is preferable to adhere to the stringent opinion.
However, if no stipulation was made, but he voluntarily lends him
money at another time, despite the fact that he is doing this only
because the other previously granted him a loan, in this instance one
may be lenient.
8

The lender must take care not to derive any benefit from the borrower
without his permission as long as his money is in the borrower's hands.
[This applies] even if it is something that he would have done for him
had he not lent him [money], because since he benefits without
permission, he (the lender) seems to be assuming that because his
money is in (the borrower's) hands, (the borrower) will forgive him.
But, when he benefits from him with his permission [then], it is
permitted, provided it is something that he would have done for him
even had he not lent him money. Another provision is that it is not
widely publicized.

9

If it was not the usual practice of the borrower to initiate greetings to
the lender on other occasions he may not initiate them [now]. [The
borrower] may not honor him with any sort of honor in the synagogue
or any other place if it was not his usual practice to do so on other
occasions. So, too, other types of ribis of words are prohibited, for it is
said ""Interest of any thing which is interest."" [The sages interpret this to
include] that even verbal ribis is prohibited. The lender, likewise, is
commanded regarding ribis devorim. For instance: If he says to the
borrower, ""Let me know whether so-and-so arrives from such-and-such
place."" Though he bothers him only to speak a few words, if he had not
been accustomed to do so before this (i.e. the loan) and now because of





the loan he bids him to do so, this constitutes ribis because [the
borrower] is obligated to him. And if you ask: ""Is it not written:'The
borrower is a servant to the lender?'"" [The answer is:] the verse refers
only to a situation where there is a dispute between them and the
lender says, ""Let us go to the Supreme Court to adjudicate our
dispute;"" and the borrower says that the dispute be heard here; then the
borrower is obligated to travel to where the lender wishes; whereas there
is no obligation on the lender to travel to the Supreme Court located
elsewhere, for it is said: ""The borrower is a servant to the lender.""
10

Even advantages that are not monetary may not be derived by the
lender from the borrower; for instance: if the lender is a craftsman, and
it is not usual for this borrower to give him work at other times, but
now, in return for the loan, he wants to give him work. This is
prohibited.

11

Preface to Paragraph 11
It was previously mentioned in the preface to this chapter that ribis deoraisa applies
where the lender and borrower, at the time of the loan, agree to a set amount of
interest to be repaid. If the rate of interest is not set, or if at the time of the loan it is
uncertain whether interest will actually be paid, then this constitutes ribis derabanan.
The following paragraph discusses one aspect of ribis derabanan.
Unlike money whose value, halachically, remains constant, the value of goods and
services fluctuate. This creates a problem when lending goods and services, because at
the time of payment, albeit the same quantity is returned, nevertheless, the value of
the said goods may have increased thereby giving the lender a profit on his loan. This
derivation of this name stems from the situation where a bushel of grain is lent with
the stipulation that a bushel be repaid. Since the repaid bushel may increase in value,





this constitutes ribis derabanan.
An exception to this prohibition: If the borrower of the goods has the identical goods
in his possession at the time of the loan which can potentially be used as payment at
the time of the loan.

You may not lend someone a sa'ah of grain [with the stipulation] that
he repay a sa'ah of grain even if they are both of the same species,
because there is the possibility that, in time, the price of the grain will
increase and, consequently, he will be repaying [value] greater than
what he borrowed. Rather, a money valuation should be set on the
grain, so that if the price of the grain increases, he will pay you only the
amount of money [at which the grain was originally valued]. However,
if the borrower owns even a small amount of that kind [of grain], he
may borrow many korim. Similarly, if that particular [grain] has a set
price in the marketplace, he may borrow [sa'ah besa'ah], even though
the borrower does not possess any [grain] of that kind. All of the above
applies where the same species of grain [are involved], but where two
different species [are involved]; for instance, lending a sa'ah of wheat
for a sa'ah of millet is prohibited under any circumstances, even if their
prices are the same and [the borrower] posesses millet. When [the loan
is] an insignificant amount, where it is unusual to be concerned about
higher or lower prices, [sa'ah besa'ah] it is permitted in all cases.
Therefore, a woman is permitted to lend a loaf of bread to her friend.
12

One who lends money for a mortgage [whether it be] a house, a field,
or a place in the synagogue, and the lender receives the benefits from
the mortgage [then] this must be done by deduction; that is, he (the
lender) must deduct a set amount per year from the loan which is then
considered the rental that the lender is paying. Even if the actual rental
value is greater than what they agreed to, [nevertheless,] it is permitted.





However, the lender may not turn around and rent [the property] to
the borrower himself. Concerning mortgages there are many additional
laws and [therefore] nothing should be done [concerning mortgages]
unless a Rabbinic authority is consulted.
13

An object that has a set price may not be sold at a higher price because
the seller is willing to wait for payment. But, an object that has no set
price, [then] even though, were he to give him the money now he
would give it to him for less, and in return for waiting for the money,
he charges him slightly more, nevertheless, it is permitted, provided he
does not charge too much. (Chavos Da'as writes [that ""too much""] is a
sixth or more above the accepted price), for then it is obvious to
everyone that it is [in return for] awaiting payment that he is charging
more. And even if he charges only slightly more, but he explicitly states:
""If you pay me immediately, then you can have it for ten but [if you
want it] on credit, you must pay me eleven,"" [this is] prohibited.
Similarly, if the buyer buys the goods at a higher price (in return for the
seller waiting for payment) in order to sell it immediately at a loss, and
to have ready cash available for a certain period of time, this, too, is
prohibited.

14

Preface to Paragraphs 14 and 15
It is a common business practice to sell promissory notes at a discount of their face
value. For example, a lender who is holding a one-hundred dollar note due in six
months, is in a situation where he needs money immediately. He finds a buyer willing
to buy the note—or the right to collect the money in six months—for ninety dollars.
Although, what has, in effect, happened is that the buyer advanced the lender ninety
dollars in return for collecting more in the future, yet no ribis is incurred because the
money advanced is not considered a loan, but, rather, a bona fide sale where the buyer





has bought the rights to ""become the lender.""
It, therefore, follows that if it is stipulated that the seller retains all responsibilities for
collecting the loan and if, for any reason, the borrower does not pay, the seller will be
obligated to pay the buyer the one hundred dollars—in that case the ninety dollars
paid is nothing but a loan with a promise that one hundred dollars will be repaid. Of
course, this constitutes ribis.

One who has a promissory note against his friend, may sell it to
another for less, even [before it is] due. The seller must write to the
buyer, ""I, hereby, sell you this note and you thereby obtain it and any
mortgage [attached to it]."" All responsibility [for collecting the monies]
must rest with the buyer. Only responsibility that emanates from the
seller, for example, selling a note that has been paid, etc. or any similar
situation, may rest with the seller. Just as the note may be sold to a
third-party at a discount, so, too, it may be sold also to the borrower
himself.
15

The following scenario is permitted: For example, Reuven needs money
[during the month of ] Nissan, and goes to Shimon, and Shimon gives
him a promissory note obligating himself to pay to Reuven one hundred
gold coins in the month of Tishri. (In response, Reuven, gives such a
promissory note to Shimon, that is obligating himself to pay him one
hundred gold coins in Tishri, so that Shimon will be reassured). Reuven
now goes and sells the promissory note that he has against Shimon to
Levi, in Nissan for ninety gold coins. (Certainly this holds true [in a
situation where] Shimon has a promissory note against Yehudah whose
due date is sometime in the future. He (Shimon) may sell it to Reuven
on credit until the [due] date and Reuven will give him a promissory
note on this [transaction]. Now, Reuven may sell this promissory note
for as much as he can get.) However, if Reuven were to write a





promissory note against himself to sell to Shimon [at a discount] even
[if the money is delivered] through an intermediary, it is prohibited.
16

It is prohibited to buy grain or any other item by paying money in
advance while the grain will be delivered at a future date, because it is
possible that in the interim the grain price will increase by the time the
delivery is made, resulting in the buyer getting more than [the value of ]
his money, because he advanced the money. However, if the seller now
has in his possession all the grain that he is selling, though he will not
deliver it to the buyer until a later date, it is, nevertheless, permitted,
because a man may sell whatever he possesses at a very reduced price if
he sees fit to do so. [This applies] even when the grain is not yet
completely ready but still needs one or two processes [for its
completion]. Regarding the transaction, it is considered completed and
is permitted. If, however, it lacks three processes it is prohibited. (See
following chapter for a permissible procedure for advancing money for
goods).

17

If the market price for grain has been set, one may buy at the market
price by advancing money, though the seller does not possess any
[grain]; for, even if the price of grain increases afterwards, the buyer
derives no profit from his advanced payment, since he could have
bought the grain then with his money at the current price. Since the
transaction was made according to halakhah, even though there was an
increase in the price of grain at the time of payment and the seller does
not wish to deliver the grain that was agreed upon, the buyer is
permitted to assess substitute goods to be delivered [at a later date]; or
the seller must give him cash value at the present price of the grain. (See
Kuntres Sha'ar Dei'ah at the end of the Seifer Sha'ar Mishpat Chapter





175, paragraph 2 which disagrees with what is written in Shulchan
Aruch of the Tanya, paragraph 28).
18

One who has merchandise that sells here at a low price and elsewhere
for a higher price, and his friend says to him: ""Give me this
merchandise and I will transport it to the place where the higher price
[can be obtained]. I will sell it there and use the money for my own
needs until such and such a time, and I will repay you according to
what it sells for there, minus the expenses incurred [in transporting and
selling] the merchandise"". If the risk in transit [for the merchandise]
was taken by the buyer, it is prohibited. But, if the responsibility
[remains] with the seller, it is permitted, provided that he compensates
the buyer with something for his bother.

19

One may lend his friend one hundred dinars with which to buy
merchandise at the yerid, and when they return home the borrower may
give him one hundred and twenty dinars for it, provided that the lender
takes delivery of the merchandise and transports it home. Since the risk
of transit on the lender, it is considered as though the lender has a share
in the profit of the merchandise, since he accepted the responsibility for
it.

20

[If ] Reuven is traveling to a place where merchandise can be purchased
cheaply, Shimon is permitted to tell him: bring merchandise from there
and I will give you so much profit; provided that responsibility for the
merchandise [rests] with Reuven until delivery to Shimon.

21

It is permitted to increase the rental of real estate. How so? One rented
a property to another and he (the owner) said to him before he (the





renter) took possession: ""If you pay me the rent in advance, you can
have it for ten guldens per year. But, if you pay me monthly, then you
must pay me one gulden per month."" This is permitted. The reason for
this is because, halachically, rent is not payable until the end [of the
rental period]. Therefore, when he takes a gulden each month, which
add up to twelve gulden, it is not compensation for awaiting payment,
because there is no obligation to pre-pay. Therefore saying to him: ""If
you pay in advance, you can have it for ten,"" is considered a waiver of
the two gulden in return for his pre-paying before payment becomes
due and this is permitted.
22

Only where real-estate rental [is concerned], is it permitted to increase
[payment] in this manner because the property is acquired immediately.
But, to profit from the wages of a worker in this manner is prohibited,
for example, if he hires a person to do a job for him sometime in the
future and he pays his wage today before he begins the work, and in
return for this (the pre-payment), he will do the work for him for less
than usual compensation, this is prohibited. Since the worker is not
obligated now, then the pre-payment is like a loan. But if the worker
began the job immediately, even though he will not complete [the job]
for many days to come, it is permitted to pay his wages in advance in
return for his working more cheaply. Since he begins the work
immediately, [the money] is considered wages and not a loan.

23

It is permitted to increase the dowries of bridegrooms. For example, if
one set aside a dowry for his daughter and agreed with his son-in-law
that for every year he leaves the dowry with him, he will give him so
much profit, this is permitted; for this is considered only as an increase
in the dowry. It is as if he had said to him: ""I will give you a gift of so





much at a certain time, and if I fail to give it to you by that time, I will
add to it so much and so much,"" which is permitted. This applies only
where they agreed to this immediately at the writing of the tena'im.
Since until that time there was no obligation on him (the father in law),
it is all considered one obligation. However, if at the writing of the
tena'im he obligated himself unconditionally to a set dowry, and at the
time of the wedding they want to arrange to give the groom something
in return for extending the time [of payment], this is prohibited. This
should be done in a permissible manner.
24

Preface to Paragraph 24
These laws are pertinent to the understanding of paragraph 24:
1) The Torah permits the borrowing from and lending to a gentile for interest. (The
Sages, however, limited the collection of interest from a gentile to the amount
necessary to earn a livelihood).
a)The lender must first approach the borrower to collect his debt. In the event that
the borrower cannot pay, then and only then may the lender demand payment from
the areiv. In this situation the original recipient of the money from the lender is
considered the borrower, regardless who pays in the end.
b) The lender retains the option to demand payment from either the areiv or the
borrower, whomever he decides to approach first. If he collects from the areiv, then
the areiv has the right to be reimbursed from the borrower. Here, the borrower is
considered to have borrowed from the areiv. It is as if the areiv borrowed the money
from the lender and then proceeded to lend that money to the borrower.

A Jew may borrow from a gentile with interest with another Jew as an
areiv under the following conditions: the terms of the loan are such that
the gentile must first demand payment from the borrower and only if it
is impossible to collect from the borrower can he demand from the




areiv. But, if the terms of the loan are such that the gentile may first
demand [payment] from the areiv; consequently, it is as if the areiv
borrowed money from the gentile and [then] lent it to the Jewish
borrower and it is prohibited. Similarly, [if ] a gentile borrowed from a
Jew with interest, and another Jew is the areiv, if the terms of the loan
are such that the lender must first demand payment from the gentile,
and only when he does not find [satisfaction] from the gentile borrower
that he may collect from the areiv, [then] it is permissible. But if the
terms of the loan are such that the lender can initially demand payment
from the areiv, consequently, the areiv is like the borrower, and it is
prohibited. However, if the Jew co-signs only for the principal and not
for the interest, it is permitted. (Concerning a Jew who borrowed from
a Jew and another Jew will be the areiv, and the borrower gives the areiv
a fee for signing, the Turei Zahav and the Sifsei Kohein in Nekudos
Hakesef are lenient. However, the opinion of the Chavas Daas is to be
stringent.)
25

When a gentile says to a Jew: ""Borrow money on interest for me from a
Jew with this collateral,"" or even if he does not give him collateral but,
only a promissory note, and the lender depends solely on the gentile's
collateral or note, and the intermediary has no responsibility, it is
permissible. And even if the Jew, the intermediary, delivers the interest
payment to the lender, he may accept it, provided that the lender
definitely understands that all the risk for the collateral and the money,
whether when it is brought, or when it is returned, is entirely his own
responsibility, and the intermediary has no responsibility whatsoever.

26

Similarly, a Jew who gave collateral or a promissory note to a fellow Jew
to borrow money on interest for him from a gentile on the collateral or





note; it is permitted, if the gentile relies solely on the collateral or the
note, and the intermediary assumes no responsibility. Similarly, if at
first a Jew lent [money] to a fellow Jew on collateral, and afterwards the
borrower said to the lender: ""Borrow money from a gentile on interest
[using] this collateral and I will be obligated to pay [the gentile] the
principal and the interest,"" if the gentile depends solely on the
collateral, it is permitted.
27

If a Jew lent [money] to a gentile on collateral for a certain rate of
interest per month, and then the Jew comes to his fellow [Jew] [and
asks] that he lend him the [same amount of ] money [originally lent to
the gentile] for this collateral, and that he should collect the interest
[owed by the gentile] that will accumulate from now until the payment
[of the loan], it is permitted. However, if the first Jew has already set
the [total amount of ] the principal and the interest for the entire
duration of the loan, [then], the whole [amount] is considered as
principal belonging to the Jew and it is prohibited to borrow with this
collateral from his fellow Jew for interest, because it is as if he paid the
ribis from his own pocket.

28

If monies of a Jew are entrusted to a gentile and he (the gentile) lent
them to [another] Jew in return for interest, if they remained the
responsibility of the gentile, meaning that if the debt be forfeited he
(the gentile) will be obligated to pay out of his own money, it is
permitted. If, however, the gentile does not assume responsibility, it is
prohibited. Therefore, in communities where there are banks or similar
institutions where Jews own shares and Jews borrow from them on
interest, even if the officers are gentiles, nevertheless, it seems to me
that it is absolutely prohibited. It is, therefore, prohibited to deposit





money there because any unrighteous Jew may borrow. Similarly, it is
prohibited to borrow from them, because an unrighteous Jew may have
deposited money there.
29

Partners who have to borrow from a gentile on interest should consult a
competent Rabbinic authority how to go about this. (See Turei Zahav
170:3, Chavos Da'as ibid: I and Shulchan Aruch of the Tanya Laws of
Ribis: 64).

30

From an apostate Jew, it is prohibited to borrow on interest, and also
lending him money on interest should be dealt with stringently.

Preface
If Reuven gives money to Shimon for investment purposes and they agree to divide the
profits or losses of this investment, then, it is considered as if each invested half the
money with each receiving the profits or losses from his respective half. Thus, the half
of the money that is Shimon's responsibility is actually a loan to him to do with as he
for safekeeping from Reuven to Shimon. The result is that Shimon expends time and
effort on Reuven's half, in return for the half that is on loan to him. This is ribis. The
entire transaction is called iska.

If one gives money to another for a business, stipulating that the profits
be divided equally and any loss incurred also be [shared] by both of
them equally, this is called iska and is prohibited. [This is] because half
of the money is considered a loan to the trader (recipient) for which he
is responsible and out of which he receives the profits, and for which he
also incurs the loss. The other half is considered as a deposit for





safekeeping, for it remains the responsibility of the investor, and he
receives the profit from this half, and also incurs the loss from this half.
The trader preoccupies himself and bothers with the pikadon half
which belongs to the investor, only because he gives him half [the
money] as a loan; this is ribis and prohibited. This transaction can be
made legal by the investor giving the trader some compensation for the
effort and bother [that he expends] when dealing with his share. [The
compensation] should be set [beforehand], or paid immediately upon
the transfer of the monies. Even a nominal payment is sufficient.
2

They may stipulate that the trader is not to be believed should he claim
that he incurred a loss from the principal, unless [there is testimony to
that effect] from valid witnesses, nor is he to be trusted regarding the
profit unless he takes an oath.

3

They may also stipulate that the trader shall have the option, that to
give the investor a fixed sum for his share of the profit, and any
remainder of the profit be left with him (the trader). This method is
proper because, it is likely that the trader, reluctant to take an oath [as
to the amount of profit] would rather give the investor the amount
stipulated between them. This is the heteir iska that is prevalent among
us. And even if the trader knows afterwards that he made no profit, or
even that he suffered a loss, he may give the investor the principal plus
the profit that they set between them, and there is no prohibition here,
for since the trader is obligated to take an oath, he may absolve himself
of the oath with his money.

4

However, it is prohibited for the trader to buy out the share of the
investor's profit for a set amount under all circumstances. But, rather,





the trader must have the option.
5

If he gave him an iska till a certain date and the trader withheld the
money beyond the repayment date, the trader [must also give him a
share of ] the profit for the time elapsed, because it is assumed that the
money remained with him beyond the allotted time on the original
terms. It is, nevertheless, preferable to add to the iska contract [the
stipulation] that if the money remains with the trader beyond the
[allotted] time, it will remain so on the same terms.

6

This is a [sample] text of an iska contract: I, the undersigned,
acknowledge that I accepted from Reb Reuven Hurwitz of Ungvar
(Czechoslovakia) the amount of 100 gulden as an iska [transaction], for
one-half year from the date recorded and I have obligated myself that
any quality merchandise as may seem to me most likely of showing
profits, I am obligated to buy with the above-mentioned sum and this
money shall take precedence over mine. All profits that Hashem will
grant me from the merchandise will [be divided], half the profit [going]
to me and half to the above-mentioned Reb Reuven. Likewise, if,
Heaven forfend, there be a loss it will be equally shared. Immediately
after the end of the half-year from the date recorded below, I am
obligated to repay to the above-mentioned Reb Reuven the principal as
well as his half of the profit. I shall not be believed to claim: ""I have
suffered a loss"" unless [I produce] testimony of two valid witnesses,
whereas, concerning the [amount of ] profit I shall not be believed
except under oath. However, there was a stipulation between us that if I
choose to pay him for his share of the profits, a sum of ten gulden,
then, he has no claim whatever against me, for the excess shall belong
to me alone even if it is established that there was a sizeable profit. All





credibility [remains] with the holder of the contract even after the date
of repayment. As long as I have not repaid the above-mentioned
monies, they remain with me as an iska in the manner mentioned
above, and I have received compensation for my labor.

If they are pressed for time and it is impossible for them to write an iska
contract, they may make all the above-mentioned stipulations orally.

8

If one prepays money for merchandise they shall draw up an iska
conract in the following manner: I, the undersigned, hereby
acknowledge that I received from Reb Reuven Weinstock, of Ungvar,
the amount of 100 gulden to do business with these monies through
[manufacturing] equipment that I control in the village, Zahan, until
the first day of the month of Nissan, may it come to us for goodness.
The profit that will be realized proportional to these monies, after
deducting all the expenses, shall be half mine and half to the
aforementioned Reb Reuven. Likewise, if, Heaven forfend, [there be a
loss], the loss incurred shall be divided equally. Immediately, on the first
day of the month of Nissan may it come to us for goodness, I obligate
myself to repay to the aforementioned Reb Reuven the principal plus
his share of the profit. I shall not be believed to say: ""I suffered a loss,""
unless with verification through the testimony of two valid witnesses. I
shall not be believed as regards the profit unless under oath. However,
there was a stipulation between us that should I want on the first of
Nissan may it come to us for goodness, to give to the aforementioned
Reb Reuven for the principal as well as for his share of the profit, the





amount of five measures of spirits, then he shall not have any further
claim against me. All credibility [remains] with holder of the contract
even after the date or repayment and I have received compensation for
my labor.

The investor may want the trader to give him a simple promissory note,
which is binding in a civil court so that in the event the trader refuses
to pay or should he die, it would be easy for him to collect his money
in the civil court. Even if they agree verbally that these monies [are
being given] as an iska, this does not suffice, even if the note is only for
the principal. Since the investor can collect the entire sum with the
note in his possession, even in the event of an established loss, such a
transaction is forbidden. Even if the trader trusts the investor, and he is
a righteous person, nevertheless, this does not suffice. Even if the trader
will also give the investor an iska contract in which it will be written
that the money mentioned in the promissory note was [given] with iska
conditions, this, too, is insufficient, because there is concern that the
investor or his heirs might conceal the iska contract afterwards and then
collect [their money] with the note. The only permissible way [to go
about] this is to deposit the iska contract with a third (disinterested)
party, or the investor must sign his name on the iska contract and it
must remain in the trader's hands, or they must write into the
promissory note that the transaction therein is based on the transaction
implicit in an iska contract, or, at the very least, they must appoint
witnesses [who will testify] that the promissory note is based on the iska





agreement. In all these ways, even if the promissory note includes the
principal and the profit, it is permissible.
10

An iska contract is of no avail unless it is the truth, that he is taking the
money to use it to transact business. But, if he does not take the money
to transact business, but to repay some loan or the like, then, an iska
contract is of no avail since it is untrue. However, it is permitted to do
the following: if Reuven, who is in need of money owns certain
merchandise, even if it is located in another locality, he may sell it to
Shimon, even at a great discount on the condition that Reuven has the
option that if it is not delivered to Shimon by a certain date, he will give
him in its stead so much and so much ([an amount] which will profit
Shimon accordingly), then Shimon may give the money to Reuven and
they make a kinyan sudar to establish the transaction. [It is done in the
following manner:] Shimon, the buyer, gives part of his garment to
Reuven for Reuven to take hold of; thereby, acquiring ownership of the
merchandise belonging to Reuven. [The transaction is binding] even
without witnesses, and the merchandise become the responsibility of
Shimon, the buyer.

11

Similarly, if Reuven owed Shimon money, and when the due date
arrived, Reuven had no money, and they agreed that Shimon would wait
a certain amount of time; here, too, an iska contract is ineffective,
unless Reuven sells Shimon some merchandise that he owns, in the
manner mentioned above. Shimon may return the promissory note that
he formerly held on him, whereby Reuven will give him a note on the
merchandise that he purchased from him in the manner mentioned
above.




12


When a Jew gives his fellow-Jew an animal to raise, on the condition of
subsequently sharing the profit, the same law applies as in the case of
one who gives money for iska.
"
"1

Do not form the habit of making vows. Whoever makes a vow, [it is
considered] as if he built an altar at a time that [private] altars were
prohibited. One who fulfills [such a vow is considered] as though he
had offered a sacrifice upon it, which makes him guilty of shechutei
chutz. Rather it is preferable that you request absolution from your vow
and that the Beis Din (Court) nullify it for you. This applies only to
ordinary vows, but vows made to the sanctuary are meritorious to
fulfill, for it is said: ""I will fulfill my vows to Hashem,"" and one should
not attempt to annul these vows unless the need is great.

2

Similarly, you should distance yourself from taking an oath. However, if
it happened that you did swear concerning any matter, you should not
attempt to annul the oath, but rather abide by it even if it causes you
distress, for it is said: ""He swears to his own hurt and changes not,"" and
afterwards it is written: ""Whoever does these things will never be
moved."" No attempt should be made to annul an oath unless the need
is great.

3

You should take care not to make any vows. It is best not to make vows
even for charity. Rather, if you possess that which you wish to donate,
give it immediately. If you do not have [what to donate], then wait
until you have and give without making a vow. If people are making





commitments to charity and you must join them, you should explicitly
state that you are committing without a vow. Similarly, when the Yizkor
prayer is said when it is customary to make a vow to charity, you should
say: [""I will give,] but I am not making a vow."" (See above Chapter 34,
paragraph 9.) At a time of great distress it is permitted to make a vow.
4

If you resolve to set for yourself [a time] for the study of Torah or to
perform any mitzvah, and are concerned that you will neglect to do so
later; or if you are concerned that your [evil] inclination might induce
you to do something which is forbidden or prevent you from doing a
mitzvah, you may quicken your resolve by means of a vow or an oath,
for Rav said: ""From where is it known that we may take an oath to
fulfill a mitzvah to quicken our resolve, though we are already under
oath to do so from [the time we stood at] Mount Sinai?"" For it is said:
""I have sworn and I have fulfilled [my oath] to preserve your righteous
mandates."" Even if you did not declare your intention in the form of a
vow or an oath, but even a simple declaration constitutes a vow and
obligates you to fulfill it. Therefore, you must be careful when saying
that you will perform any mitzvah to say: ""[I will do so] but I am not
making a vow."" It is worthwhile to develop this habit, even when
planning on doing something mundane, so that you will not transgress
the violation of vows.

5

One who makes vows in order to improve his character is considered
diligent and praiseworthy. These are examples: A glutton vows to
abstain from eating meat for a certain time, or if he was overindulgent
in wine he vows to abstain from wine and other intoxicating beverages.
Similarly, one was vain about his good looks and took upon himself the
nazirite vow. These vows are for the service of God, blessed be His





Name, and regarding these situations our Sages said: ""Vows are a
protective fence for abstinence."" Nevertheless, a person should not
make it habitual even regarding vows of such nature, but should strive
to conquer his vices even without resorting to vows.
6

A vow is not valid unless the ""mouth and heart were as one."" But if you
vowed mistakenly [that is,] your intention was not the same as the
utterance of your lips, or if you only thought of making a vow, but did
not utter it with your lips, this is not [considered] a vow.

7

If you are accustomed to adhere to certain [voluntary] restrictions that
are permitted according to the halachah in order [to create] a hedge and
a fence or to inculcate self abstinence, for example, fasting during
selichos days, or abstaining from eating meat and drinking wine from
the seventeenth day of Tammuz until Tisha B'av, and other similar
[restrictions], even if you practiced these things only once, but intended
to continue this practice always, or practiced them three times even
without the intent to continue this practice always, but did not
stipulate that it shall be ""without a vow,"" and you [now] wish to cancel
[this practice] because you are not well—you require nullification [of
your vow by a Beis Din]. You must begin [the nullification process]
with regret, i.e. that you regret that you assumed this practice as a vow.
Therefore, if you wish to assume some restrictions [for the purpose of
creating] a hedge or for [reasons of ] abstinence, you should first state—
that you do not take it upon yourself as a vow, and you should also say
that you intend to practice this only for that time or at other times that
you may wish to do so but not for always [as a regular practice].




8


What is the process of nullification for a vow or an oath? You must go
before three learned men one of whom is an expert in the laws of vows,
who knows which of the vows may be nullified, which of them cannot
be nullified, and in what manner it may be nullified, and they (these
three men) may nullify it for you. A vow made in a dream should
preferably be nullifed by ten learned men.

9

Although where all mitzvos of the Torah are concerned a son does not
reach adulthood until he is thirteen years old, and has grown [pubic]
hair, and a daughter does not reach adulthood until she is twelve years
old and has produced ""signs"" [of adulthood], nevertheless, where vows
and oaths are concerned they become responsible one year earlier. That
is, a young boy twelve years and a day, and a young girl eleven years and
a day, even though they haven't produced ""signs,"" if they understand in
whose name a vow or an oath is made, their vow is a [valid] vow and
their oath is a [valid] oath. But, [if they are] younger than this age, even
if they understand [vows and oaths], their words count for naught.
Nevertheless, they should be reprimanded and spanked in order that
they not become accustomed [to making] vows and [swearing] oaths. If
[the vow that the youngsters made] is insignificant and easy [to fulfill]
not entailing any suffering, they should be ordered to fulfill it.

10

A father may cancel his daughter's vows until she comes of age, that is,
when [she reaches the age of ] twelve years and six months, provided
that she has not married. A husband may cancel his wife's vows. What
is the process for cancellation? He says three times: ""cancelled"" or
""absolved"" or any other language that indicates total abrogation of the
vow, regardless whether he says this in her presence or not in her





presence. However, language of ""nullification"" is not valid for a father
or husband. Also, they can only cancel the vow within the day they
heard it. That is, if they heard the vow at the beginning of the evening,
they may cancel it all night and the entire following day. If they heard
[the vow] close to the time that the stars appear, they can cancel it only
until the stars appear. Beyond that time they cannot cancel it. On
Shabbos, he should not say to her: ""It is cancelled for you"" as [he would
say] on a weekday, but he should cancel it in his heart, and say to her:
""Take and eat"" or some similar expression. If the father or the husband
at first said that he is satisfied with the vow, although he did not say so
explicitly, but said something that indicated his satisfaction, and even if
it was only in his heart that he thought that he is satisfied by her vow,
he can no longer cancel it. (If she made the vow conditional upon some
act, see Shach 234:45.)
11

What manner of vows can a father or husband cancel? Only matters of
physical discomfort such as: bathing, adorning herself, eye makeup,
hairdo, and the like. The husband can cancel also things that do not
entail physical discomfort, if they are matters concerning things
between husband and wife which cause resentment between them.
However, these things are permitted [for her] only for as long as she
remains with him. [But], after she is widowed or divorced they are
prohibited to her.
"
"1

When you set out on a journey, whether from home or from a place
where you lodged overnight en route, as well as on returning home,
after having left the boundaries of the city, that is seventy and two-





thirds amohs beyond the last house, you should say the traveller's
prayer: ""May it be Your Will, Hashem our God and the God of our
fathers that You lead us in peace, etc."" This prayer is said in the plural
form, except for: ""vesiteneini lechein"" which is said in the singular form.
It is preferable to recite Tefillas Haderech after you have travelled a mil
beyond the outskirts of the city. Once you are en route and stay
overnight in any city, you may recite it in the morning even before you
leave.
2

It should not be recited unless you have to travel at least a parsah. It is
preferable to recite it within the first parsah. If you forgot, you may
recite it as long as you are still on the road, provided that you have not
yet reached to within a parsah of the city where you intend to spend the
night.

3

Tefillas Haderech should be said following another berachah. Therefore,
if you depart in the morning and will say the morning berachos while
en route or if you lodged overnight on the trip, in any city, (in which
case you may recite Tefillas Haderech even before you depart) and you
recite the morning berachos even before departing, then, you may recite
Tefillas Haderech after the berachah Hagomeil chasadim tovim le'amo
Yisrael. [But,] if you depart from home after prayers, [then] you should
eat or drink something while en route and recite the after-berachah,
and immediately [thereafter] recite Tefillas Haderech. After urinating
and reciting Asher Yatzar, you may recite immediately [Tefillas
Haderech.]

4

It should be recited while standing. If you are riding an animal or
travelling in a wagon, if it is possible to stop the animal [then,] you





should stop it because riding an animal is equivalent to walking. If it is
not possible to stop the animal you may recite it while riding.
5

Tefillas Haderech is recited only once each day that you travel. But, if
you stopped off in a city intending to spend the night there, and,
afterwards, reconsidered and left it to continue onward or to return
home, you should recite it a second time. If you travel day and night or
if you spent the night in an uninhabited place, [then,] the first time you
recite Tefillas Haderech, you recite it with a closing berachah and the
remaining days you recite it without a closing berachah, because as long
as you do not spend the night in an inhabited place, it is considered
one [continuous] journey.

6

Before departing on a journey, you should give charity, for it is said:
""Righteousness will precede him and he will set his footsteps upon the
way."" You should take leave from the leaders of the city that they may
bless you with success on your journey. You should endeavor that some
people escort you. When escorting a friend, and when taking leave of
him, you should remain standing in your place until the traveller
disappears from view. Those who bless the traveler should not say to
him: ""Go in peace,"" but, [rather,]: ""Go towards peace;"" because David
said to Absalom: ""Go in peace."" He went and was hung, whereas Yisro
said to Moshe: ""Go towards peace,"" and he [Moshe] rose to success.
While traveling, you should be occupied with Torah study, for it is said:
""And when you travel on the road."" You should also recite some Psalms
each day with concentration and humility. You should take care to take
along bread even when traveling to a nearby destination. You should
also take along tzitzis lest a tzitza become invalid and being unable to
obtain another, you will remain idle from [fulfilling] a mitzvah. ""A





person should always arrive when it is good and depart when it is
good,"" that is, when traveling to an inn towards evening, you should
arrive while the sun is still shining, and the following day you should
wait until the sunrise and [then] depart, and then things [will be] well
for you, as is written: ""God saw the light that it was good."" You should
not overeat while on a journey.
7

When eating at an inn, you should carefully take note whether the
owner and his household are righteous and trustworthy. If you
contemplate eating meat at an unfamiliar place, you should investigate
thoroughly as to who is the Shochet [ritual slaughterer] and who is the
Rabbi who supervises him, for due to our ""many sins"" violations are
common and one who is wise will understand [the allusion]. And
certainly where wine is concerned, where because of our ""many sins""
the transgressors have proliferated, therefore scrutiny and investigation
are necessary.

8

When praying shacharis on a journey, you should take care to wrap
yourself in a tallis gadol just as you do when praying in the synagogue,
because the ""small"" tallis is unlikely to be the proper size. If you are
traveling by foot, then, when reciting the verses: Shema Yisrael and
Baruch shem kevod malchuso le'olam va'ed, you should stand still so that
you are able to concentrate well. If you are riding an animal or sitting
in a wagon you are permitted [to recite Shema in that position.] [When
reciting] Shemoneh esrei you should stand. If you are pressed to be on
your way, [then] if you can stand for at least the first three berachos of
Shemoneh esrei and the last three berachos, you should do so, and if it
not (you cannot stand), then you may pray sitting in the wagon and
perform the [required] bendings in a sitting position. However, it is





preferable to pray even immediately at dawn, and minchah even
immediately after a half hour past midday, in order to pray while
standing and to pray properly. (The distance you must travel to seek
water [for washing the hands] and to pray with [a minyan of ten], is
discussed in Chapter 12 parag. 5 and 8.)
9

The law concerning the situation of a traveler when mealtime arrives
and he finds no water, is discussed in Chapter 40:14. In Chapter 42:19
it was explained that one who eats bread may not leave his place before
reciting Birkas Hamazon. In Chapter 44:6 it was explained that one
may recite (Birkas Hamazon) only while sitting. However, if you eat on
the road, while walking, you are permitted to recite Birkas Hamazon
also while walking, because you would be uneasy if you were compelled
to halt [in order to say Birkas Hamazon.] But, if you ate while sitting,
then, Birkas Hamazon, too, must be recited while sitting.

10

It is the custom of some, when traveling and eating at the house of a
Gentile, not to recite Birkas Hamazon with a mezuman because it is not
considered [a] fixed [meal]. Nevertheless, if they set themselves there to
eat together [as a group] [then,] it is not proper to annul the mezuman.
They should recite: Harachaman hu yishlach lanu berachah merubah
bimekom halichaseinu ""May the Compassionate One send us an
abundant blessing wherever we travel,"" uvimekom yeshivaseinu ad olam
""and wherever we stay, always."" If they partake of the food of one
person, they may recite: Harachaman hu yevareich es ba'al habayis hazeh,
""May the Compassionate One bless this host"" referring to the owner of
the meal. If not, (i.e. if each eats his own food) they should recite:
Harachaman hu yevareich osanu ""May the Compassionate One bless
us."" See above, end of Chapter 44.




11


Halachically, it is prohibited to travel more than three parsas, on Fridays
whether to your home or any other destination, in order to enable them
(i.e. his hosts) to prepare adequately the needs for the Shabbos meals.
[However,] in these lands this [law] is not adhered to because most
people prepare in abundance. Nevertheless, you should take great care
to arrive at your place of accommodation when there is still sufficient
daylight, because many violations of the Shabbos result due to late
arrivals. Therefore, you should take great care and not rationalize by
saying: ""The day is yet long and the road is good.""

12

Should you find yourself, on the holy Shabbos, in mid-journey at an
inn, and have money in your possession, if you can deposit it safely
with someone, or hide it, it is forbidden to keep it in your pocket, for it
is muktzeh. If you fear lest it be stolen, you may sew it into your
garment on Friday and remain in the house and not walk out with it if
there is no eiruv. But, if there is concern that because of not leaving the
house all day it will be sensed that you possess money and you may be
robbed, you may go out with it if it is sewn into your garment. But, if it
is in your pocket, [then] going out is prohibited in all circumstances.
(See also Chapter 189 concerning precautions to be taken for a
journey).

""Rabbi Chelbo said, in the name of R. Huna: 'A person must always
take care [to pray] the Minchah prayer, for Elijah was answered only at
the Minchah prayer, as it said: It was at the time of the Minchah and
Elijah came near.'"" The reason the Minchah prayer is so esteemed [is]





because the Shacharis prayer has a set time, [i.e.] in the morning when
arising from bed we immediately pray before becoming involved with
our own affairs. Similarly, the Maariv prayer has a set time, [i.e.] when
we arrive home and are free from our tasks. But, the Minchah prayer is
prayed while the day is yet long and we still are absorbed in our affairs,
and we must pay attention and free ourselves from all our affairs to
pray. Therefore, its reward is very great.
2

The most proper time for the Minchah prayer is from nine and one half
hours and on; and that is called Minchah ketanah. When the situation
is urgent, for example, if you must depart on a trip or if you must eat,
you may pray [Minchah] immediately after six and one-half hours and
this is called Minchah gedolah. The time [for Minchah] is preferably,
until one and one quarter hours before nightfall and not later. This (the
1–1/4 hours before night) is called pelag haminchah (lit. half of the
Minchah), because from the time of Minchah ketanah until nightfall
two and one-half hours elapse; half of this is one hour and one quarter.
After the fact (i.e. this preferable time has lapsed) or in time of great
need, you may pray until the stars appear. This has now become the
custom in most congregations—to pray Minchah shortly before
nightfall. These [above-mentioned] ""hours"" are ""time-variable hours,""
measured according to the length of daylight from sunrise until sunset,
the day is divided into twelve parts. [For example] if daylight is
eighteen hours then 1–1/2 hours is considered one ""hour.""

3

It is forbidden to begin eating even a small meal shortly before [the
time of ] Minchah ketanah. By shortly we mean one-half hour before. If
you do not sit down to a meal, but eat or drink only casually, [such as]
fruit or any cooked dish, even if it is [made] of the five grains, some





authorities permit it. But, it is best to be stringent even in this regard.
Similarly, it is forbidden to enter a bathhouse or to [have] a haircut
shortly before Minchah ketanah. An elaborate meal, such as at a
wedding or a circumcision and the like, must not be started even
shortly before [the time] of Minchah gedolah; therefore it is prohibited
to begin such a meal beginning from midday. It is best to wait until the
time [for] Minchah gedolah and pray [Minchah] before the meal. In
communities where the people are summoned to the synagogue and it
is your usual practice to attend synagogue to pray communally, [then,]
you may start a small meal close [to the time] of Minchah ketanah, and
even afterward, provided that immediately upon being called to
synagogue you interrupt whatever you are doing [in order] to pray.
When it is close to Minchah Ketanah, an elaborate meal may not be
started even where [people] are called to synagogue; and even close [to
the time] of Minchah gedolah it is preferable to be stringent.
4

The Minchah prayer also requires washing of the hands until the joint
(i.e. the wrist) as does the Shacharis prayer as was explained above in
Chapter 12, paragraph 5 and paragraph 6 (See Chayei Adam Chapter
33, para. 6, and the Shulchan Aruch of the Tanya, Chapter 92, footnote
23). Likewise, you must wash your hands, for the Maariv prayer, if you
were interrupted after Minchah, and for Musaf, if you were interrupted
after Shacharis.

5

The Ashrei that precedes Minchah should not be said until a minyan is
present in the synagogue, so that the chazzan may say Kaddish
following the Ashrei which was said by ten men. If Ashrei was said with
less than a minyan and afterwards the minyan was completed, another
psalm should be said, and then, the chazzan says the Kaddish. The





chazzan should wrap himself in a tallis before reciting Ashrei, in order
that there be no interruption between Ashrei and the saying of Kaddish.
If there was no tallis [available] until after Ashrei was said, he wraps
himself in it, and says a few verses of Psalms, after which he recites
Kaddish.
6

If time is short and it is close to nightfall, the chazzan should begin
reciting the Shemoneh Esrei aloud, immediately after saying the
Kaddish. The congregation should not pray [at this time], rather listen
and make the necessary responses until he (i.e. the chazzan) says Ha'el
Hakadosh; they, then, answer Amein and pray [the Shemoneh Esrei]
silently. If the time is extremely short, and there is concern that if they
wait for the chazzan until after he says Ha'el hakadosh, they may not
complete their prayers while it is still daytime, they may immediately
pray along with the chazzan silently, word for word, until Ha'el
Hakadosh. It is preferable, if possible, that there be at least one [person]
that will respond Amein to the berachos of the chazzan.

7

If you come to the synagogue and find the congregation praying
Shemoneh Esrei, you should pray the Shemoneh Esrei along with them
and say Ashrei after Shemoneh Esrei. If you will be unable to complete
the Shemoneh Esrei before the chazzan reaches kedushah, and if you wait
until after the chazzan completes the entire Shemoneh Esrei as well as
the Kaddish, the time for [the Minchah] prayer will pass, [then] you
should wait and pray silently along with the chazzan when he repeats
the Shemoneh Esrei, word for word, and say the entire Kedushah text
along with him, as well as ledor vador, etc., just as he (i.e. the chazzan)
says. You should complete the berachah Ha'el hakadosh and the
berachah Shomei'a tefillah together with him. Modim, too, should be





said together with him, so that you can bow along with the
congregation. However, on a public fast day, you should not say Aneinu
with the chazzan. but recite it during Shemei'a tefillah, as [would] any
other individual. Similarly, if you want to pray Maariv together with
the congregation, but if you wait [to pray Minchah] until after the
chazzan [completes] the repetition of the Shemoneh Esrei, you would be
compelled to pray Maariv alone, then you should pray Minchah along
with the repetition of the chazzan. If you arrived just before Kedushah,
you should wait until after the chazzan says Ha'el hakadosh, answer
Amein and, then, pray [Minchah]. Although you will miss answering
Amein following Shomei'a tefillah, as well as Modim, which are
obligatory, nevertheless, it is preferable [to miss the responses] than to
miss the chance of praying Maariv with the congregation. And certainly
you should do so, if the time for Minchah is elapsing. (See above
Chapter 20, para. 11.)
8

If the Minchah prayer is delayed until night, the Tachanun prayer is not
said, because Tachanun is not said at night. Care should be taken that
Minchah not be delayed until actual nightfall, because, in that case,
Kaddish tiskabeil is not said after prayers belonging to the previous day,
since the night belongs to the following day.

9

If you arrived for Minchah on Friday at the synagogue, and the
congregation already accepted the Shabbos or Yom Tov, that is on
Shabbos they already said: Mizmor shir leyom haShabbos, and on Yom
Tov they already said Barechu, you should not pray Minchah in that
synagogue, rather you should go outside the synagogue and pray. If you
hear the chazzan saying Barechu, you should not respond along with
the congregation, for if you answer Barechu, you are no longer





permitted to pray a weekday prayer. (If you mistakenly responded, then
you should pray [the] Maariv Shemoneh Esrei twice as explained above,
Chapter 21.) If you arrive shortly before the acceptance of Shabbos or
Yom Tov, although you will be unable to complete Shemoneh Esrei,
before they accept Shabbos or Yom Tov, [nevertheless] you may pray
[Minchah], since you began at a permitted time.
"

The [beginning] of the Kerias Shema period of the Maariv prayer is
when three small stars become visible. On a cloudy day one should wait
until ""the doubt leaves his heart."" Nowadays it is customary for the
congregation to pray Maariv immediately after Minchah, even it is not
yet night in order not to burden the congregation, for it is a burden for
the congregation to gather a second time. This should not be done
before pelag haminchah, for then, even already having done so, they will
not have fulfilled their obligation. Fortunate is one who prays Maariv
with the congregation after nightfall; and between Minchah and Maariv
engages in the study of Torah, so that he joins night and day with
Torah. According to Kabbalah this is a significant matter. At any rate, it
is fitting for any God fearing person, who prayed with the congregation
before nightfall, not to eat [a meal] before nightfall. He should wait and
immediately after the stars appear he should read the three chapters of
Kerias Shema and then eat his meal. One who does not pray with the
congregation is forbidden to pray Maariv before the stars appear.

2

It is preferable to pray Maariv immediately when the stars appear. It is
forbidden to start a meal or do anything, even to study [Torah], one-





half hour before the stars appear, the same as it is forbidden before
Minchah ketanah. If you have no time, for instance, if you teach a
group [at that time], you should, at least, not delay [praying Maariv]
beyond midnight. Even if you prayed after midnight, although it is
after the fact, as long as it is before daybreak, you have fulfilled your
obligation.
3

If you arrive at the synagogue for the Maariv prayer, and find the
congregation about to begin the Shemoneh Esrei, even if it is before
nightfall but after pelag haminchah, you should pray Shemoneh Esrei,
along with them, and afterwards—after nightfall, recite Kerias Shema
with the berachos. If the congregation is holding in mid-Kerias Shema
and its berachos, and you have sufficient time to recite Kerias Shema
and [its] berachos until Shomeir amo Yisrael la'ad, before they reach
Shemoneh Esrei, you should do so and omit Baruch Hashem le'olam etc.
and you are not required to say it after the prayer. If you have not yet
prayed Minchah, you should pray the Shemoneh Esrei prayer of Minchah
while the congregation is reciting Kerias Shema with the berachos, and
wait, at least the time required to walk four amos and afterward pray the
Maariv Shemoneh Esrei with the congregation. Afterwards—after
nightfall you should recite Kerias Shema with the berachos.

4

Baruch Hashem le'olam until Yiru eineinu should be said preferably
while seated. It is forbidden to interrupt from the beginning of Vehu
rachum until after the Shemoneh Esrei. The Shamosh's announcements
of Ya'aleh veyavo! and Tal umator! are not considered an interruption
because they are needed for the prayer.




5


If one person remains praying Maariv at the synagogue at night his
friend must wait until he completes his prayers so that he not be
distracted. [However,] if he began to pray at a time which would not
enable him to complete his prayer together with the congregation, then
one is not obligated to wait for him, because it is apparent that he
knowingly began this prayers because he is not afraid.
"
"1

After [completing] the Maariv prayer you should set aside a time for
Torah [study], to fulfill the verse: ""And you shall meditate in it day and
night."" (Joshua 1:8) You should recognize the fact that if you eat first,
you might be overcome by sleep since you are tired and nature will
demand rest. This will cause you to neglect Torah study. Therefore, you
should take care to set aside a time for study before your meal.
However, if you are hungry and famished because you didn't eat
enough by day, you may have a snack so that your mind is at ease, and
then study a little. Then you may eat your meal to your satisfaction,
and resume your Torah study, according to your ability. Our Sages of
blessed memory said: ""Night was created solely for study,"" referring to
the [long] winter nights. Nevertheless, also during the shorter nights
you should study a little each night to fulfill the verse: ""And you shall
meditate in it day and night."" From the fifteenth day of the month of
Av and on you should gradually add to your study period. Reish Lakish
said: ""Whoever is engrossed with Torah study at night a chord of grace
is strung around him by day, as is said: 'By day God will command His
grace [over us] and at night His song is with me.' [This can be
interpreted:] ""For what reason will God command His grace [over us],





because His song is with me at night."" Others stated: ""Reish Lakish
said: 'Whoever is engrossed in Torah study in this world which is
compared to the night, God strings about him a chord of grace in the
World to Come which is [compared to] day as is said: ""By day God will
command His grace and at night His song is with me"".'"" Certainly,
one, who has a set time to study every day and was deterred during the
day, should compensate for his commitment, at night.
2

It is advisable for a normal, healthy person to eat moderately at his
evening meal and it should be lighter than the meal he eats by day. The
benefit of such a course is fourfold: 1) he will preserve his health, 2) it
will prevent sinful things, [namely] that it not lead to nocturnal
emissions, which are caused by excessive eating and [eating] things that
warm [the body], 3) his dreams will be pleasant and calm, because
excessive eating and drinking cause nightmares, 4) he will not sleep too
heavily and he will be able to awaken at the proper time. It is sufficient
for a healthy person to sleep six hours. You should be careful not to
sleep in a room alone, and not to sleep in a place that is too hot, and
not in a place that is too cold.

3

It is proper for every God fearing man before going to sleep, to examine
the deeds that he performed all day. If he finds that he committed a
transgression he should regret and confess it and wholeheartedly resolve
not to do so again. Especially the common transgressions, such as
flattery, lies, mockery and gossip require careful scrutiny. A person
should also resolve to forgive any person who sinned against him, so
that no person be punished on account of him, for it is stated in the
Talmud: ""Whoever is the cause for another's punishment is not
permitted to enter into the presence of the Holy One, blessed is He.""





He should say three times: ""I forgive whoever hurt me"" and afterwards
say: Ribono shel olam, hareini mochel etc. [""Master of the Universe, I
hereby forgive"" etc.]
4

If you did not recite the three chapters of Kerias Shema after nightfall,
then you should say all three chapters during the Kerias Shema before
retiring. But if you did recite them at night, all that you are required to
recite at the Kerias Shema before retiring is the first chapter itself.
Nevertheless, [to fulfill] the mitzvah in its excellence, you should recite
all three chapters. Afterwards, [it is customary] to say psalms and verses
describing God's mercy as printed in the prayerbooks. In most
prayerbooks the berachah of Hamapil is [printed] before Kerias Shema;
but it is preferable, [however,] to recite the berachah of Hamapil at the
end, so that the berachah immediately precedes sleep. Kerias Shema and
the psalms should be said before you go into bed, and the berachah of
Hamapil should be said when you are in bed. Before going to bed you
should walk over to the mezuzah, place your fingers on it and say
Adono-y shomri etc. Afterwards you should say seven times: Bechol
derachecha etc. After reciting the berachah of Hamapil you should not
eat or drink or speak until you fall asleep. If you cannot sleep, you
should again recite Kerias Shema, the psalms and the verses of mercy,
and continue reciting them until you fall asleep. You may also repeat
many times the following verses: Torah tzivah lanu etc., Eish tamid …,
Se'afim saneisi …, Or zaru'a … until overcome by sleep. This reading is
also a preventive against noctural emissions, Heaven forbid. Your
purpose for sleeping should be to strengthen yourself for the service of
your Master; thereby it will be considered as serving God. If you intend
to engage in marital relations, you should not recite the berachah





Hamapil first but, afterwards you should recite at least the first chapter
of Kerias Shema and, then, recite the berachah Hamapil.
5

You should undress yourself and not sleep in [day] clothes. When
removing your shoes or clothes, you should remove those on the left
first. You should not place your clothes under your head, because it
causes one to forget his learning. You should take great care to get
yourself into the habit of lying on your side. It is strictly forbidden to
lie in a supine position, that is your back downward and your front
[facing] upward, or conversely—your front downward and your back
upward, but only on your side. It is advisable to begin sleeping on the
left side and finish on the right side; this is beneficial for one's health
because the liver is located on the right side and the stomach on the
left, and when leaning on the left the liver rests on the stomach and
warms it with its heat thereby facilitating the speedy digestion of food.
After the food has been digested it is advisable to turn on the right side
so that the stomach rests and cause the waste to pass, and you should
not turn from side to side too often [during the night] (The laws of
modesty will be explained, if God so wills, in Chapter 150).
"
"1

The holy Shabbos is the great sign and covenant which the Holy One
Blessed is He gave to us, to know that in six days the Almighty made
the heavens and the earth and all that is in them, and abstained from
work on the seventh day. This is the foundation of our faith. Our Sages
of blessed memory said: ""Shabbos is equivalent to all the mitzvos.""
""Whoever keeps the Shabbos in accordance with its laws is regarded as
though he fulfilled the entire Torah;"" and ""whoever desecrates the





Shabbos is like one who completely denies the whole Torah."" And so it
is said in Ezra: ""And You came down on Mount Sinai and You gave
Your people righteous judgments and true laws … and Your holy
Shabbos You made known to them.""
2

Anyone who desecrates the Shabbos publicly is regarded as a non-Jew
in every respect. If he touches wine you are forbidden to drink it; the
bread he bakes is like the bread of a non-Jew; the food he cooks is like
the food cooked by a non-Jew. ""Publicly"" means in the presence of ten
Jews and it is not necessary that he actually desecrates the Shabbos in
their presence, but [even] if they know of the desecration it is
considered public. This law is derived from the Talmud and poskim.
The Talmud asks, ""Was not the incident of Queen Esther public
knowledge?"" The Peri Megadim ruled that ""publicly"" means in the
presence of ten Jewish men, or when the desecration is public
knowledge.

3

Therefore the prophet offers praise and says, ""Fortunate is the man who
does this, and the son of man who maintains this, he who preserves the
Shabbos from desecration etc."" The prophet describes the reward of one
who keeps the Shabbos in accordance with Halachah, and honors it and
delights in it to his utmost ability. He will be rewarded in this world
besides the great reward reserved for him in the World to Come, as it is
said: ""If you restrain your feet [from going out of the techum] and
abstain from doing your business on My holy day and you proclaim
Shabbos a delightful day, and the sanctified of God, honored, and
honor it by not engaging in your weekday activities, and abstain from
pursuing your business affairs and (from) speaking words [pertaining to
your weekday needs]; then you will delight yourself before Hashem,





and I will cause you to ride over the heights of the earth, and will
nourish you with the inheritance of Jacob, your father, for the mouth of
God has spoken.""
4

It is written, ""Remember the Shabbos day to keep it holy,"" which
means: you must remember the Shabbos every day of the week to keep
it holy. Thus, if you happen to find a rare delicacy which is not
available every day, and which will not spoil, you should buy it in
honor of Shabbos. On the eve of Shabbos it is a mitzvah to rise early in
the morning to purchase your Shabbos needs. You may shop for them
even before saying the [morning] prayers, provided that doing so will
not cause you to miss praying with the congregation. It is preferable to
make purchases on Friday in honor of Shabbos rather than on
Thursday. But something that requires preparation should be purchased
on Thursday. With each purchase you make you should say, ""This is in
honor of Shabbos."" In accordance with the ordinance of Ezra, clothes
should be laundered on Thursday in honor of Shabbos, and not on
Friday, because on Friday you must be engaged in preparations for
Shabbos.

5

Even though he has many servants, it is a mitzvah for every person to
do something himself in honor of Shabbos, in order to honor it, as was
the custom of Amoraim. Rav Chisda used to cut the vegetables very fine,
Rabba and Rav Yosef used to chop wood [for cooking], and Rav Zeira
used to light the fire. Rav Nachman used to put the house in order, and
would bring in the vessels needed for Shabbos and remove the weekday
vessels. Everyone should learn from them and not say ""I will not
blemish my honor,"" for by honoring the Shabbos, he honors himself.




6


It is the custom among Jews everywhere, to bake breads (Challos) at
home in honor of Shabbos. Certainly if on weekdays you eat bread
from a non-Jewish (kosher) bakery, you should take care to eat bread
baked in a Jewish bakery on the holy day of Shabbos. But even if on
weekdays you eat bread from a Jewish bakery, nevertheless, in honor of
Shabbos, the bread should be baked at home to give the woman of the
house the opportunity to fulfill the mitzvah of separating challah. This
is especially important for the woman because Adam was created on
Erev Shabbos (Friday) and he was the challah of the world. The woman
(Eve), through her sin caused him to lose (much of his spiritual
greatness); she, therefore, must rectify this loss (through the mitzvah of
challah). Three challahs should be made: a large one, a medium one,
and a small one. The medium one for the evening meal, the large one
for the daytime meal, to show that the honor of the daytime meal is of
greater importance; and the small one for the third meal.

7

You should prepare choice meats, and fish, and fine wine according to
your means. It is a mitzvah to eat fish at every Shabbos meal if it agrees
with you. But if it does not agree with you or if it isn't pleasing to your
taste you should not eat it, for the Shabbos was given for enjoyment
and not for discomfort. You should sharpen the knives, for this is also
included in honoring the Shabbos. You should put the house in order,
make the beds, and cover the table with a tablecloth. The table should
remain covered the entire Shabbos. Some people are meticulous to
spread out two tablecloths. You should rejoice in the coming of the
Shabbos. Imagine how you would put the house in order in honor of
the arrival of a dear and distinguished person, all the more so [should
you exert yourself ] in honor of the Shabbos Queen. In some places they





make meat pies, also called mulyesa for the Shabbos evening meal, in
remembrance of the Manna which lay as if in a box, dew on the bottom
and dew on top. On Erev Shabbos, you should taste the food that was
cooked for Shabbos.
8

Even a poor Jew should endeavor and make every effort to delight in
the Shabbos. He should economize all week in order to have enough
money to honor the Shabbos. And if he doesn't have money he should
borrow, even if he must give security, in order to provide the needs of
Shabbos. Regarding this, our Rabbis of blessed memory said, ""My
children, borrow for My sake and I will repay you."" On Rosh Hashana
all of man's needs are apportioned for him except his expenses for
Shabbos and Yom Tov, for if he spends more for Shabbos and Yom Tov,
Heaven adds more to his (allotment). If he is in extremely poor
financial straits, our Rabbis of blessed memory said, ""Make your
Shabbos simple (like the weekdays) rather than depend on people.""
Nevertheless, if at all possible, he should at least try to do something to
honor the Shabbos, even a minor thing, like [purchasing] small fish or
the like. If something is sent to you to eat on Shabbos, you should eat it
on Shabbos and not leave it for a weekday.

9

Regular work should not be done on Erev Shabbos, from the time of
Minchah Ketanah and thereafter, but on a provisional basis it is
permitted. If one must work in order to provide for Shabbos meals, it is
permitted even after that. It is forbidden to make clothes for someone
for money, but if he is poor and wants to earn enough for Shabbos
needs (meals), he is permitted to work all day [Friday]; just the same as
on Chol Hamoed. Giving a haircut to a Jew is permissible all day [on
Friday], and even a professional haircut for pay [is permitted] because it





is obvious that the haircut is given now for Shabbos. Stores should be
closed [at least] one hour before the Shabbos.
10

From nine hours, shaos zemanios and thereafter, it is a mitzvah to refrain
from eating a regular meal, even the kind you regularly eat during the
week. A type of meal that is not usually eaten during the week, even a
meal that is considered a mitzvah that can be eaten on another day
must not be eaten at any time on Friday, (not) even in the morning.
But a meal that is considered a mitzvah which must be eaten
specifically (on that) day, such as the meal given at a circumcision, or at
the redemption of the first born son, and the like, is permitted. But,
nevertheless, it is proper to (make it) early in the morning and not to
prolong it, and certainly not to indulge in overeating, so that you will
be able to eat the Shabbos meal with appetite.

11

Every man must complete the Parshah of the week with the
congregation; that is, you should read the weekly portion (of the Torah)
twice and the Targum (Onkelos) once. From Sunday and after, it is
considered [reading] 'with the congregation' (for the congregation has
already started reading this portion at Minchah on Shabbos). But the
mitzvah done in its perfection is to read it on Erev Shabbos in the
afternoon. You should [first] read each chapter two times and after that
the Targum. It makes no difference if the Chapter is a closed or open
one. And even if the chapter ends in the middle of a verse, you should
stop there. After finishing the Targum you should read one verse from
the Torah in order to conclude with the Torah. It is best not to
interrupt the reading with conversation. It is also customary to read the
Haftarah, and some are accustomed also to say Shir HaShirim after that.
If you are traveling and you have only a Chumash without Targum, you





should read the weekly Torah portion two times, and when you come
to a place where a Targum is available you should read the Targum.
[Every God fearing Jew should also study Rashi's commentary on the
Sidrah. If you are not capable [of learning Rashi], you should study a
commentary in Yiddish such as the seifer Tze'enah Ure'enah in order to
understand the subject matter of the Sidrah].
12

It is a mitzvah for everyone to wash his face, hands, and feet with hot
water every Friday. And if possible you should wash your whole body
with hot water, and immerse yourself in the mikveh [ritualarium].

13

It is forbidden to bathe with your father, father-in-law, your mother's
husband, or your sister's husband. And in places where it is customary
to cover their nakedness in the bath house, it is permitted. And also the
student should not bathe with his (teacher) Rebbe, but if he needs him
to assist him, it is permitted.

14

It is a mitzvah to wash your hair and to cut your nails and to have your
hair cut if it is too long. You should not cut your fingernails and
toenails on the same day, and you should not cut your nails or your hair
on Rosh Chodesh, even if it occurs on Erev Shabbos. Some are particular
not to cut their nails in consecutive order but to alternate; beginning
with the right hand, you start with the finger next to the thumb, and
the symbol is 2, 4, 1, 3, 5. On the left (hand) you start with the fourth
finger, and the symbol is 4, 2, 5, 3, 1. Some are also particular not to
cut their nails on Thursday because they start growing on Shabbos
which is the third day. It is proper to take care to burn your nails after
they are cut.




15


Every Erev Shabbos you should examine your deeds, arouse yourself to
repent and make amends for all the misdeeds you did in the six
weekdays; because Erev Shabbos incorporates all the days of the week,
just as Erev Rosh Chodesh incorporates the whole month.

16

You should try to wear fine clothing and also a nice tallis in honor of
Shabbos, as it is written ""And you shall honor it;"" and it is explained
[by the Sages] that your Shabbos clothes should not be like your
weekday clothes. And even if you are traveling amongst non-Jews, you
should wear Shabbos clothes, because the clothes are not for the honor
of those who see them but for the honor of the Shabbos.

17

Cooked foods must be removed from the coals before Shabbos. If you
forgot, and did not remove them, you are forbidden to remove the pot
while coals are burning around it; since by taking the pot the coals will
be moved. But it is permissible through a non-Jew.

18

Cooked food [may be] placed in the oven [on Friday] to be eaten on
Shabbos, as is our custom. Even though the door is not sealed with
mortar, it is permitted. However, it is forbidden to open the oven at
night, for there may be food which is not thoroughly cooked, and by
closing the oven afterwards you will cause the cooking to be
accelerated.

19

The law which permits us to place cooked food in the oven even when
the oven door is not sealed with mortar applies only to meat, and also
to various kinds of legumes [peas, etc.], and also to various types of
dough, provided you put them in the oven a long time before nightfall,
so that the food will be cooked a little before nightfall, until it reaches





the stage when it can be eaten with difficulty. But if you place legumes
or types of dough in the oven close to nightfall you must seal the oven
door with mortar. (For probably the coals were not removed or were
not covered and cooled with ashes properly.) You must be careful about
this; for if you failed to do this, the food is forbidden even bediavad
(post factum) until after Shabbos, until enough time has elapsed to
accomplish what was done (on Shabbos)
20

On Shabbos, opening the oven door that is sealed with mortar, should
be done by a non-Jew, and if a non-Jew is not available, it should be
opened by a minor. If a minor is unavailable, even an adult may open
it, but in a way that is different than on a weekday.

21

Erev Shabbos, when you put a pot of coffee, into a hole [in the ground],
[to retain its warmth,] so that it can be used on Shabbos, and cover it
with pillows or similar things to keep it warm; if you put it into sand, it
is forbidden to insert the whole vessel into the sand. Even if you don't
insert the whole vessel but only part of it, and you cover the remainder
with clothing or similar things, so that the whole vessel is covered on all
sides, this too is forbidden. You must do it in such a way that the pot of
coffee is inserted so that only one half or one third is in the sand, and
the remainder exposed to the air (in the hole). You may then place a
board or inverted vessel to cover the hole so that there is air space
between it (the cover) and the pot of coffee. After doing this you may
put over them clothing, pillows or similar items. (For more laws
pertaining to hatmanah see Shulchan Aruch, Chapters 257, 258, 259.)

22

Before dark on Friday you should gently ask your household: ""Did you
separate Challah?"" And you should tell them to light the (Shabbos)





candles.
23

You must examine your clothing on Friday before dark (to see) whether
a needle is stuck in them or if there is anything in the pockets. Even in
a place where there is an eiruv [it is necessary to check clothing] because
the pockets might contain something that is muktzeh.
"
"1

It is forbidden to allow a non-Jew to do work for you on Shabbos. They
(the Sages) based this on the verse: ""No manner of work should be
done,"" which implies (not) even through a non-Jew. If you give the
work to the non-Jew on Friday even though the non-Jew does it on
Shabbos, it is permissible, But only on these conditions: a) the non-Jew
must take the article from the house of the Jew before Shabbos and not
on Shabbos.

2

b) The wages of the non-Jew should be set in advance so that he will be
doing the work for his own sake in order to get paid. Therefore, if you
have a non-Jewish servant for a pre-determined period of time, it is
forbidden to allow him to do any work for you on Shabbos, because
then the work is done solely for the benefit of the Jew. If a non-Jew
travels to a certain place and a Jew gives him a letter to carry there,
which he will carry on Shabbos, the Jew must give him some
compensation, so that the non-Jew does it for his compensation and
not gratis.

3

c) The wage should be established for the entire job, and the non-Jew
should not be hired by the day.




4


d) It is forbidden to stipulate with the non-Jew that he do the work on
Shabbos. Even if you are not explicit about his doing it on Shabbos, but
you set the time for the work to be completed shortly after Shabbos,
and it is clearly impossible to complete the work by that time unless it
is done on Shabbos; this too is prohibited. Similarly, if you give him a
letter and tell him, ""See to it that it is delivered there on such and such
day,"" and it is clearly impossible, unless he travels on Shabbos; this too
is prohibited. Likewise, if the market day is on Shabbos, it is forbidden
to give a non-Jew money on Friday to buy something for you when you
know that he can only buy it on Shabbos. Similarly, it is forbidden to
give him something to sell for you under these conditions. However,
the aforementioned instance in which you did not specify that he do
the work on Shabbos is only prohibited if you give (the work) to him
on Erev Shabbos, but before then you may give him something to make
or some money with which to make purchases. It is best not to live in a
city where the (only) market day is on Shabbos, for it is impossible to
avoid violations. If the market is not in the Jewish neighborhood, there
is no reason to worry.

5

e) The work should not be connected with the soil such as construction
or farm work. Construction work is forbidden through a non-Jew on
Shabbos even if you have stipulated his wage for the entire construction
job. If the matter is very pressing you should consult a Rabbinical
authority. And even to cut stones or prepare wooden beams for
building purposes, if it is known that they belong to a Jew, and the
non-Jew works on it in public, it is forbidden to be done on Shabbos.
This rule applies also to farm work such as plowing, harvesting, etc;
even if you hired the non-Jew to do the job for a set wage, (contractual





basis) and he is not a salaried worker, it is forbidden. However, if the
non-Jew receives a percentage of the crop, and it is customary in those
areas, that the farm worker shares in the crops, it is permitted. If the
field is far away, so that no Jew lives within techum Shabbos, it is
permissible [for the non-Jew to work on it] even for a pre-set wage
(without a share), provided he is not paid by the day.
6

If a non-Jew built a house for a Jew on Shabbos, in violation (of the
aforementioned Halachos), it is proper to be scrupulous and not move
into it. (This Halachah has many details.)

7

If you own a field or mill, you may lease them to a non-Jew even
though the non-Jew will work there on Shabbos. But you may not lease
a bathhouse to him. If the bathhouse is not yours, but you merely
rented it from a non-Jew, you should consult a Rabbinical authority on
how to act. Similarly, if you own a hotel, brick factory or glass factory,
etc., you should consult a Rabbinical authority on how to act.

8

It is forbidden to allow a non-Jew to do a melachah under any
circumstances in the house of a Jew. Even if a non-Jewish servant wants
to do a melachah for himself [in your house], you must protest his
doing so.

9

If a non-Jewish tailor made a garment for you, and brought it to you on
Shabbos you may wear it. But if you know that he completed it on
Shabbos you may not wear it unless it is of extreme necessity. You are
not allowed to take vessels or clothing from the craftsman's house, not
even from a Jewish craftsman, on Shabbos or Yom Tov. If the non-Jew
is not a craftsman but owns a store that sells shoes etc., a Jew who





knows him well is permitted to take shoes from him on Shabbos and
wear them. (You may do this) provided the price of the merchandise
was not established and (provided) the goods were not brought from
outside the techum.
10

Tools that are used for a melachah, such as a plow or similar things, are
forbidden to be rented to a non-Jew on Erev Shabbos. For though we
are not commanded to let our utensils rest (on Shabbos), nevertheless,
since you take a fee, and you rented it to him on Erev Shabbos, it
appears as though the non-Jew is your agent. However, on Thursday,
you may rent to a non-Jew. It is permitted to lend him [tools] even on
Erev Shabbos, even tools normally used for a melachah, provided the
non-Jew takes them from your house before the Shabbos sets in. Even if
you make an agreement with the non-Jew that he lends you his tools, in
return, on another occasion, it is permitted, and we do not consider
this equivalent to renting. And so to rent him utensils not used for a
melachah, is also permitted, even on Erev Shabbos; provided the nonJew removes them before Shabbos.

11

It is permitted to rent vessels to a non-Jew, on the aforementioned
conditions, only when you are not paid for Shabbos separately, but
rather as a day among the other days. For example (it is permitted) to
rent him (the vessels) for a month or a week, and tell him, ""For the
entire week or the entire month you must pay me this amount,"" or
even [if you tell him] ""For every two or three days (you must pay this
amount)""; but specific payment for Shabbos, is forbidden. Even if you
rent it to him for a year and you calculated individual days, [for
example, if ] you said, ""I am leasing it to you for a year or a month, and
for each day pay me so much""; even though afterwards the non-Jew





pays you for all the days in one lump sum, it is forbidden to accept the
compensation for Shabbos, since individual days were calculated. It is
forbidden to accept compensation for Shabbos unless it is included as
part of a time period, even for such utensils that are not used for a
melachah, and not even for the rental of a room. The prohibition of
taking compensation for Shabbos is from non-Jews and Jews alike.
"
"1

You may not board a sea-going vessel less than three days before
Shabbos; that is from Wednesday on, it is forbidden. But if you are
going to perform a mitzvah, you may embark even on Friday.

2

[If the boat is to sail] on rivers you may embark for any purpose, even
on Friday, provided that a Jew need not perform melachah on Shabbos.
And even if animals pull the boat, it is permitted.

3

(In cases) where it is permitted to board ship on Friday, and you
boarded the ship on Friday and remained there until dark, even though
you went home and remained overnight at home, you are permitted
back on board ship on Shabbos, provided the ship does not make the
trip exclusively for Jewish passengers. However, since you were in your
house on Shabbos, you established shevisah [residence] in your house,
therefore, if the boat sails more than the techum Shabbos and reached
land on Shabbos, you are permitted to walk only four amohs, but it is
forbidden to walk more than that from the landing. See chapter 95.

4

It is permitted to board a ship on Shabbos in order to pray with a
minyan of ten, or for the sake of another mitzvah, provided the ship is





making the trip for others as well. However, you should try to board
the ship on Friday while it is yet day and remain there till nightfall,
after which you may return to your home, and come back to the boat
on Shabbos. But if the vessel makes the trip only for the sake of a Jew, it
is not permitted.
"
"1

Every person must put all work aside and light the Shabbos candles at
least a half hour before the stars come out. If they recited Mizmor shir
leyom haShabbos in the synagogue even though there is still two hours
until night, nevertheless, the Shabbos laws become binding on the
minority, and they are forbidden (to do) any manner of work. Even
someone who arrives from another city, is obliged to observe the [laws
of ] Shabbos as soon as the congregation has said, Mizmor shir leyom
haShabbos. In a city that has two synagogues, one is not bound by the
other.

2

It is a mitzvah to (light) many candles in honor of the Shabbos. Some
are accustomed to light ten (candles) and others light seven (candles).
And in no event should less than two candles [be lit] symbolizing [the
verses:] Zachor [Remember] and Shamor [Preserve]. In time of pressing
need even one (candle) is sufficient. The candles should be long
(enough) to burn at least until after the meal. And you should endeavor
to buy the best candles, for Rav Huna said: ""He who habitually
practices the lighting of Shabbos candles; who endeavors to buy the
best ones, will have sons that are Torah scholars."" As it says: ""For the
mitzvah is a candle and the Torah is a light."" Through the mitzvah of





the (Shabbos) candle will come the light of the Torah. It is, therefore,
fitting for the woman to pray at candle lighting time that the Holy
One, blessed is He, grant her sons who are bright in the study of Torah.
Prior to lighting candles it is good to give some charity. A woman who
has trouble raising her children, or who has no children at all, should
recite the Haftarah of the first day of Rosh Hashanah after lighting the
candles. It is good if she understand what she is saying, and she should
say it with concentration.
3

It is a mitzvah done in its perfection to light with olive oil, but even the
oil we commonly use that is called ""Blumenöl"" is kosher. But among
other oils, there are some that are not kosher. Regarding the wick too, it
is best to use cotton, flax, or hemp; for among other materials there are
some that are not kosher. And in our country we are accustomed to
light with candles of tallow which are kosher. But putting a piece of fat
into a vessel, and inserting a wick into it—is forbidden for the purpose
of candle lighting. The one who lights the candles must light them
until the fire ignites most of the wick protruding from the candle. The
same applies to candles made from tallow; the fire must ignite most of
the wick that protrudes from the candle.

4

It has already been established that the berachah for all mitzvos must be
said before doing the mitzvos. But [this does not apply to] lighting
Shabbos candles, for by lighting the candles the woman ushers in the
Shabbos; and since the berachah is the beginning of the lighting, if she
makes the berachah first she will no longer be able to light the candles.
Therefore, she first lights the candles, and in order that the berachah be
said before doing [the mitzvah], she covers her face with her hands so
that she doesn't see the candles and she says the berachah and removes





her hands, and looks at the candles. In so doing, it is like saying the
berachah before lighting the candles. (And in order not to differentiate,
this procedure is also practiced on Yom Tov.) The important candles
with which the Shabbos is welcomed—are those that are on the table
where the meal is served, and therefore she should light them last. And
in time of need, as when she has to immerse herself in the mikvah, or
go to a marriage ceremony, or for other important matters, she may
light them with the stipulation that she is not assuming [the holiness
of ] Shabbos with the lighting (of the candles) and then she can say the
berachah before lighting. In this regard, even a mental reservation is
sufficient.
5

The mitzvah of lighting the candles is incumbent on both men and
women, but women are urged to be more concerned with the mitzvah
because they are usually at home at candle lighting time. The woman
extinguished the light of the world when she caused Adam to sin and
darkened his soul which is called light, as it is written, ""The light of
God is the soul of man."" Therefore she must make amends for this by
lighting candles in honor of Shabbos. Therefore if the woman is in her
home she takes precedence in performing this mitzvah. Nevertheless
the man should also assist with the mitzvah. He should prepare the
candles and should singe them; that is, he should light them and
extinguish them, making it easier to light them afterwards, After a
woman gives birth, her husband should light the candles the first
Shabbos and say the berachah, but after that and also each time she is a
niddah, she should light them and say the berachah.

6

Before lighting candles women customarily wash themselves and dress
up in Shabbos clothes. Fortunate are those who do so. She must recite





the Minchah prayer before lighting candles, because by lighting candles
she assumes the sacredness of Shabbos, and she can no longer pray the
weekday Minchah prayer. If a woman was delayed by her occupation
[or business], and came home close to a half hour before Shabbos, and
if she would then wash and dress there would be a risk of desecrating
the Shabbos, it is a greater mitzvah to light (the candles) as she is, rather
than risk, Heaven forbid, a possible desecration of Shabbos. If the
husband sees that she is late in coming home it is a great mitzvah for
him to light the candles and to disregard her resentment.
7

When the man lights the candles, [knowing] that afterwards he must
perform some task, it is also advisable that he stipulates that he does not
assume the holiness of Shabbos with this lighting, but if he did not
make this reservation, he is still permitted to do work after (lighting),
because when the husband lights candles it is not ordinarily an act of
ushering in the Shabbos.

8

Candles must be lit in the room where the meals are served in order to
indicate that they were lit in honor of Shabbos. They should not be lit
in one place and transferred to another place. However in time of
pressing need, for instance when the woman is sick and unable to go to
the table, she may light them at her bed, and they may be placed on the
table in the house, because the whole house is considered their place.
And women who light the candles in the sukkah and bring them into
the house afterwards, are not doing the proper thing. A candle that was
burning before Shabbos must be extinguished and then relit in honor
of Shabbos, in order to make it clear that it is lit in honor of Shabbos.




9


You must light candles in all the rooms that are being used. If you are at
home with your wife, since she says the berachah on the candles in one
room, it is not necessary to say a berachah on the lighting (of candles)
in the other rooms. But if you are in another place, where you have a
room for yourself, you must light candles and say the berachah. If
several men live in one room, they should all share the cost of buying
candles. One of them should light them and say the berachah [and they
must all listen to the berachah], and he should have in mind to include
all of them in his berachah, and they should also have in mind to be
included in his berachah. But if you do not have a private room but
you are in one room with the host who is Jewish (who is lighting), you
need not light candles since your wife is lighting for you at home.
Unmarried students who are learning away from home, and have a
private room, must light candles with a berachah, and they should also
share (the cost of ) buying candles. One of them should say the
berachah and have them all in mind. It is necessary that the candles
burn until they return to their room. And if they do not have a private
room, since they have no wives to light candles for them, they must
give a coin to the host in order to acquire a share in the candles. One
who is supported by the host is considered one of the household and
need not share in the cost of the candles.

10

It is a custom that even if many women light candles in one house, each
one says the berachah on her (own) candles, because the more light, the
more joy. However, care should be taken that two (women) should not
light in one candelabra, but in times of pressing need we may be lenient
even in this regard.




11


No water should be put—even by day [before shabbos]—into the
socket of the candlestick wherein you place the tallow or wax candle, so
that it will be extinguished on reaching it; but in case of necessity, this
rule may be waived provided the water is put there in daytime. But
placing a vessel with water under a candelabra so that if sparks fall they
will be extinguished—this is strictly forbidden even when placed when
it is still daytime. But placing a vessel without water to intercept the
sparks is permitted even after dark because sparks are not tangible.
Placing a vessel to catch the dripping oil or fat is forbidden once it is
dark, for should oil or tallow drip into the vessel, it would be forbidden
to move the vessel. Consequently, you are neutralizing the vessel from
its state of readiness, which is forbidden, because it is considered as
though it were fastened there. But placing it there while it is still day is
permitted. And if oil dripped into it you are forbidden to use the oil on
Shabbos and you are not allowed to move the vessel. And if (oil) did
not drip into it, it is not forbidden to move the vessel, merely because
of intent.

12

It is best to put the challos on the table before you light the candles. See
further in chapter 89: 2.

13

If a blind woman has a husband, he should light (the candles) and say
the berachah. And if she doesn't have a husband and she lives alone she
lights the candles and says the berachah. And if she lives in a house with
others and they light candles, the blind (woman) lights her candles
without a berachah. If she is the head of the household she lights first
and says the berachah, and afterwards the others should light their
candles and say the berachah.




14


If a woman once forgot to light the Shabbos candles, for the rest of her
life she should light one candle more than she usually lit. And if she
forgot several times she should always light an extra candle [for each
time]. This is done to impress upon her to be more careful in the
future; therefore, if it was due to an emergency that she did not light
her candles, she need not light additional candles.
"
"1

It is customary to pray the Maariv prayer of Shabbos earlier than on
weekdays. It is proper to do so in order to usher in the Shabbos as early
as possible—so long as it is done from Pelag haMinchah onwards. And
even those accustomed to praying Maariv on time during weekdays,
which is when the stars appear, may pray earlier on Shabbos. Although
sometimes on weekdays the Minchah prayer is said at the same time at
which Maariv will now be said, it does not matter with regard to the
Maariv prayer of Shabbos, for it is a mitzvah to add time to the holy
[Shabbos.]

2

The berachah of Hashkiveinu is not concluded the same as on weekdays
i.e., ""Who guards His people Israel."" This berachah encompasses the
entire nation of Israel, and the entire nation of Israel does not require
protection on Shabbos because the Shabbos itself protects us. But we
say instead ""Spread [over us]"" and conclude: ""Blessed are You Hashem,
Who spreads the shelter"" etc. The same law applies to Yom Tov. If you
mistakenly concluded the berachah as on a weekday, and you remember
immediately after saying the word lo'ad [forever], you should
immediately say: Haporeis sukkas shalom, ""Who spreads the shelter of





peace"" etc. But if you didn't remember until after kedei debur you need
not say it again.
3

It is the custom to say in the Maariv prayer, ""and may (Israel) rest
'thereon,'"" and in the Shacharis and Mussaf prayers, ""and may (Israel)
rest 'thereon'"" and in the Minchah prayer, ""and may (Israel) rest
'thereon.'""

4

After the Maariv Shemoneh Esrei Friday night, (the entire congregation)
says ""Vayechulu"" together. This is said while standing, because this
passage is our testimony that the Holy One Blessed is He—created the
world, and witnesses must give their testimony while standing.

5

After this the chazzan recites the abridged form of the seven blessings
[of the Maariv Shemoneh esrei] which is: Baruch atta Hashem [Blessed
are you Hashem] Elokeinu Velokei avoseinu [our God and God of our
fathers etc.], Magein avos [Shield of (our) fathers etc.], Elokeinu velokei
avoseinu etc., and concludes Baruch atta Hashem ""Blessed are You,
mekaddeish haShabbos [Sanctifier of the Shabbos.""] The congregation
should stand when the chazzan recites this berachah and they should
listen attentively. It is customary to say with him Magein avos [Shield of
(our) fathers] until zeicher lema'aseih vereishis… [in commemoration of
the work of creation.] One who prays alone may also say the prayer of
Magein avos until zeicher lema'aseih vereishis but not further.

6

On all Shabbosos of the year this berachah is said, even on Yom Tov,
and even on Shabbos which occurs at the close of Yom Tov. But when
the first night of Pesach falls on Friday night it is not said.




7


It is not said unless there is a permanent minyon. But in a place where
ten people pray only on occasion as in the house of a bridegroom, or in
the house of a mourner, it is not said. If a place was established wherein
ten Jews would pray for several weeks, as at a market-fair, Magein avos is
said.

8

In these countries it is customary for the chazzan to recite the
""Kiddush"" in the synagogue on Shabbos and Yom Tov evenings, (except
on the first two nights of Passover). Since he does not fulfill the mitzvah
with this Kiddush, and it is forbidden for him to taste the wine before
Kiddush, therefore in order that his berachah not be in vain, the wine is
given to a child who has reached the age of chinuch. When the child
hears the berachah from the chazzan, he is exempt from saying a
berachah, and thus the chazzan's berachah was not in vain. (For it is
permitted to feed a child before Kiddush, as will be explained later on
in chapter 165.) And if there is no child in the synagogue, the one who
recites the Kiddush or another person should have in mind to fulfill his
mitzvah of Kiddush with this Kiddush, and drink the amount of a
revi'is in order to recite the concluding berachah. And even so he may
recite the Kiddush again in his house to exempt his wife and household,
if they are unable to recite Kiddush themselves. The mitzvah of
Kiddush is fulfilled with the Kiddush which is recited in the
Synagogue, even though [the rule is that] Kiddush is not valid unless it
is accompanied by a meal, because in time of pressing need, we rely on
the ""Poskim"" who hold that it is sufficient to drink a whole revi'is from
the cup. And it is best to drink a revi'is in addition to the mouthful
[that is swallowed], so that the mouthful is counted for Kiddush and
the revi'is for the meal.




9


We are accustomed to recite the chapter entitled Bameh madlikin, [on
Friday evening]. It is not said when Yom Tov falls on Shabbos, nor
when Yom Tov falls on Friday, and not on Shabbos Chol Hamoed.

10

It is customary not to arise as early on Shabbos to go to the synagogue
as during weekdays, since sleep is one of the pleasures of Shabbos. This
custom is supported by a Scriptural verse; concerning the daily offering
on weekdays it is said: ""In the morning,"" but concerning the Shabbos
offering it is said: ""And on the Shabbos day,"" which indicates a later
time (in the day). However you must be careful not to delay the reading
of Shema and Shemoneh esreih [beyond the proper time, see chapters 17,
18.]

11

The time for the Mussaf service is immediately after the Shacharis
service. And it must not be delayed later than the end of the seventh
hour. The person who recites Mussaf after seven hours is called a
transgressor, but nevertheless his obligation is fulfilled because the time
(for reciting Mussaf) is all day.

12

If you must pray two prayer services, the Minchah service, and the
Mussaf service, for example if you delayed praying mussaf until six and a
half hours, you should first pray Minchah and after that Mussaf, because
Minchah is recited more regularly [daily], and it is an established rule:
that when a regular practice conflicts with an occasional practice, the
regular practice takes precedence. However, in congregational prayers,
this rule is not followed.

13

In the Kedushah of Mussaf when the congregation says: Shema Yisrael,
Hashem Elokeinu, Hashem Echad. ""Hear Israel Hashem is our God





Hashem is One,"" and the congregation immediately says: Echad hu
Elokeinu ""One, He is our God,"" etc., it is a mistake, for it is forbidden
to say the word ""One"" twice consecutively; but the congregation should
say ""Hashem is One,"" ""He is our God,"" etc. But the chazzan who
pauses while waiting for the congregation may begin with the word
""One"" [Echad] since he paused between [the two Echads].
14

At Minchah before reading the Torah we say: Va'ani sefilasi ""But as for
me, may my prayer etc."" This is in accordance with the interpretation
of our Sages of blessed memory of the verse: ""They talk of me, those
who sit in the gate, and (about me) are the songs of drunkards."" And
immediately thereafter it is written: ""But as for me, may my prayer …""
etc. King David said before the Holy One Blessed is He, ""Master of the
Universe, this Nation is not like other nations of the world. Other
nations of the world when they drink, they get drunk, and become
boisterous, but we are not like that, for even though we drink, we say
'But as for me, may my prayer …' etc."" Therefore this verse is recited
before the reading of the Torah to give thanks to our Creator that He
has not assigned our portion like theirs for even the ignorant among us
come to hear the reading of the Torah. On Yom Tov which occurs on a
weekday, since the Torah is not read, Va'ani sefilasi is not said. But on
Shabbos even though there is no seifer Torah from which to read,
nevertheless it is said. In such an event it is said before the Half
Kaddish in order that there be no interruption between Kaddish and
Shemoneh esreih.

15

After the repetition of the Shemoneh esreih we are accustomed to say
""Tzidkasecha tzedek …"" [""Your righteousness is righteousness
everlasting""] which consists of three verses that are similar to ""Tzidduk





Hadin."" [These verses express our acceptance of Divine decree] on the
death of three Tzaddikim [pious souls] who passed away at this time
[Shabbos afternoon]: Yoseph, Moshe and Dovid. If Shabbos occurs on a
day where if it were a weekday Tachanun would not be said,
Tzidkassecha tzedek is not said. But when praying with a congregation
in the house of a mourner, it is said, for if it would not be said it would
be a public demonstration of mourning and public mourning is not
permitted on Shabbos.
16

If you made a mistake on Shabbos or Yom Tov and began saying the
intermediate portion of the weekday Shemoneh esreih, and reminded
yourself in the middle of the berachah, you must complete the entire
berachah that you began, and afterwards begin the intermediate
berachah of the Shabbos or Yom Tov (Shemoneh esreih). The reason
being that halachically it would have been appropriate to enact that
even on Shabbos and Yom Tov the intermediate berachos be recited as
on weekdays, and the holiness of Shabbos be mentioned in the
berachah of Retzei as is done on Rosh Chodesh and Chol Hamoed, but
due to the honor of Shabbos and Yom Tov, the Sages did not want to
burden us and thus enacted that only one intermediate berachah be
said for the holiness of the day. But since you began the weekday
berachah you must complete that berachah since it is fitting that it be
said now according to halachah.

17

Even if you started to say only one word of the [wrong] berachah, and
remembered instantly, you must complete the berachah except in the
berachah of Attah chonein. In this berachah, if all you said was the word
attah, since the Shabbos prayers of Maariv and Minchah also begins
with attah, therefore in the Maariv or Minchah prayers, even though





you forgot that it was Shabbos and you began (with) the word attah
with intention to say attah chonein but you remembered immediately
that it is Shabbos, you need not complete the berachah, Attah Chonein,
but continue by saying kidashta at Maariv and echad at Minchah. If,
however, this happens at Shacharis [then it depends]: if you erred
because you thought it was a weekday you must complete the berachah
Attah chonein. But if you knew it was Shabbos and were supposed to
say Yismach Moshe, but through a slip of the tongue, due to habit, you
said the word attah, you need not complete the berachah Attah chonein,
rather say Yismach Moshe; for since there are in the Shabbos prayers
other prayers that begin with attah, it is as though you mistakenly
substituted one Shabbos prayer for another, since you knew it was
Shabbos and you only said the one word.
18

If you did not realize [your error] until you began saying the
concluding berachos, (that is from Retzei [be pleased] and further) you
should stop in mid-berachah, at the place you remembered, and begin
(the berachah) of Shabbos or Yom Tov, and conclude (the prayer) in its
(proper) order. If you did not realize until after you started to say:
Yiheyu leratzon [may they be acceptable], you must start from the
beginning of the Shemoneh esreih.

19

If you erred in the Mussaf prayer and said the weekday berachah in the
middle of Mussaf, you must stop in the middle of the berachah in
which you remembered your error, and begin the middle berachah of
the Mussaf prayer, because for the Mussaf prayer there was never an
halachic consideration to include all the middle berachos of the
weekdays, but only the one berachah of Mussaf.




20


If one errs and begins the weekday Shemoneh esreih on Shabbos it is a
bad omen for him, and he should examine his deeds during the coming
week and repent.

21

If you erred in the middle berachah of the Shabbos Shemoneh esreih
substituting one berachah for another, [e.g., you said in Shacharis, Atta
kidashta (You sanctified) instead of Yismach Moshe (Moses will rejoice)]
if you remember before you said the Name (of Hashem) at the
conclusion of the berachah, you must repeat from the beginning of the
berachah which you should have been praying. But if you did not
remember until after you said (the Name of ) Hashem, you should
conclude and say Mekadeish Hashabbos [Sanctifier of Shabbos.] By
doing so you will fulfill your obligation, because the principal part of
the middle berachos is Retzei na bimenuchaseinu [be pleased with our
rest] which is uniform in all the prayers (of Shabbos).

22

The above rule applies only to Maariv, Shacharis, and Minchah
Shemoneh esreih but as for Mussaf, if you substitute another prayer, you
have not fulfilled your obligation, since you did not mention the Mussaf
offering. Similarly, if instead of the Maariv, Shacharis, or Minchah
Shemoneh esreih you prayed the Mussaf Shemoneh esreih you have not
fulfilled your obligation, for since you mentioned the Mussaf offering
you uttered an untrue statement before Hashem.

23

If you erred in the Yom Tov prayers, and instead of concluding
Mekadeish Yisroel vehazemanim, [Sanctifier of Israel and the Seasons,]
you concluded with Mekadeish Hashabbos, [Sanctifier of the Shabbos,]
if you retracted within the time of kedei dibbur and said Mekadeish





Yisroel vehazemanim, you fulfilled (your obligation). And if not, you
must go back and start (again) from attah vechartanu.
"

It is a positive Biblical commandment to sanctify the Shabbos day with
words, as it is said: ""Remember the Shabbos day to sanctify it,""
implying that Shabbos should be remembered with kiddush. And you
must remember it when it arrives by reciting kiddush, and also when it
departs by reciting havdalah. The Sages ordained that this remembrance
should be enacted over a cup of wine, when it arrives and when it
departs.

2

You may recite kiddush and eat the Shabbos meal even though it is not
yet night. However, those accustomed to pray Maariv at the proper
time, during weekdays but who pray earlier on Shabbos, are forbidden
to eat after one half-hour before the stars appear. If therefore it is only
one-half hour until nightfall, they must wait until nightfall. And then
they should first read the three chapters of Shema and after that recite
kiddush. It is forbidden to eat anything, even (to drink) water before
kiddush.

3

It is a mitzvah to recite kiddush on old wine and a mitzvah to select
fine wine. And if possible you should dignify the kiddush by using red
wine. Where suitable kosher wine is unavailable you may recite kiddush
on raisin wine. You should say Vayechulu while standing and while
looking at the candles; and afterward you should sit down and look at
the (kiddush) cup and say the berachah Borei peri hagafen [Who creates





the fruit of the vine] and Asher Kideshanu [Who sanctified us, etc.]. If
you don't have wine you may recite kiddush over bread but not on any
other beverage.
4

Women are also obligated to recite kiddush. Therefore they should
listen well to the kiddush and answer Amein. But the should not say
Baruch Hu uvaruch shemo [Blessed is He and blessed is His Name.] A
minor, even if he is thirteen years old, but is not known to have two
pubic hairs, cannot exempt the woman, and therefore the woman
should recite kiddush herself. And if she doesn't know how to say it,
she should say it word by word with the minor. Similarly if she hears
the kiddush from her husband or another man, it is most proper that
she should say it word by word with the one who recites kiddush. (See
Dagul Meirevavah and Shulchan Aruch haTanya.) (If there are several
heads of a household in one house, the correct procedure of reciting
kiddush is discussed in chapter 135, paragraph 6.)

5

Wine that turned sour should not be used for kiddush. This law also
applies to wine that has a bad odor, even though it has not turned sour.
If its odor and taste is that of wine over which the berachah Borei peri
hagafen is said, but it has a slightly disagreeable odor because it was kept
in a filthy barrel, or it has the same odor as the barrel, it should not be
used for kiddush. Similarly, wine that remained uncovered for several
hours, (even though nowadays we are not strict about this) should not
be used for kiddush, [as the Prophet says]: ""If you offer it now to your
governor, will he be pleased with you, or show you favor?"" If the wine is
powdery it should be strained, and if it can not be strained, it may be
used for kiddush as is. But if there is a white film on it, it should not be
used for kiddush, because presumably it has lost its flavor.




6


Kiddush may be said on boiled wine and on wine that has honey [or
sugar] in it. But there are those who say that these should not be used
for kiddush since they are not fit for use on the Altar. Therefore if
possible an attempt should be made to obtain other wine.

7

The (kiddush) cup must be whole and clean. All the laws that apply to
the cup used for Birkas hamazon apply to the cup used for both the day
and night Kiddush and also to the cup used for havdalah. It is good to
say kiddush at night over a large cup so that some of it remains for the
kiddush of the day and for havdalah.

8

The challahs should be covered during kiddush, and even if you say
kiddush over them they should be covered during kiddush in
commemoration of the manna which was covered with dew both
underneath and from above.

9

The person who recites kiddush should drink at least a full cheek of
wine from the cup without interruption. It is a mitzvah for everyone to
taste from the cup of blessing. Someone who does not drink wine
because of a vow, or because it is harmful to him, or for similar reasons,
should not make kiddush on wine and rely on those present to drink it.

10

The kiddush wine is a necessary part of the meal, and does not require
a [separate] after-berachah, because the Birkas hamazon exempts it. But
there are Poskim who hold that Birkas hamazon does not exempt it.
Therefore after Birkas hamazon you should endeavor to make a
berachah over a cup of wine, and drink a revi'is and say the concluding
berachah which will also exempt the wine of kiddush.




11


On wine which you drink during the meal you need not say a
berachah, for it is exempt with the berachah Borei peri hagafen of
kiddush.

12

If you made kiddush on the cup, thinking that it contained wine and
then discovered that it contains water or some other beverage, you must
repeat the kiddush over wine. If there was wine on the table and you
also intended to drink wine during the meal, you need not repeat the
kiddush, because it is considered as though you made kiddush on that
wine. And if there was no wine on the table, but there was wine in the
house which you intended to drink during the meal, you need not say
the berachah, Borei peri hagafen [Who created the fruit of the vine] but
only the [berachah] Asher kideshanu, [Who sanctified us.] If the cup
contained beer or mead, [and you live] in a place where they are
accepted beverages, in any case there is no need to repeat the kiddush,
and you should say the berachah Shehakol and drink it. And in places
that are accustomed to reciting kiddush after washing the hands, before
breaking the bread, there is also no need to repeat kiddush, rather say
the berachah Hamotzi and it is considered as though you said kiddush
over the bread.

13

By day, at the morning meal, you must also recite kiddush over a cup
[of wine]. You need say over it only the berachah Borei peri hagafen
[Who creates the fruit of the vine] and this is [sufficient for] kiddush.
Women are also obligated to say this kiddush. Before this kiddush it is
also forbidden to taste any food or even water, just as before the
kiddush at night. It is a mitzvah performed in its perfection when this
kiddush is also said specifically over wine. [However], if you prefer





whiskey and say kiddush over it, you also fulfill the mitzvah, but you
should be careful [to see] that the cup holds a revi'is and you should
drink a full cheek without interruption. If you say kiddush on wine and
you also want to drink whiskey or coffee see chapter 49, paragraph 6,
regarding the proper berachah.
14

Both at night and during the day kiddush must be recited only at the
place where the meal is served, as it is said, ""And you will call the
Shabbos a delight."" And our Rabbis of blessed memory expounded: In
the place where you call forth the Shabbos, namely with the saying of
kiddush, that should be the place of delight. Therefore, if you say
kiddush in one house and eat in another house, even if during kiddush
you had this in mind, you have not fulfilled the mitzvah of kiddush.
You are also required to eat the meal immediately after kiddush. And if
you did not eat immediately after kiddush, you did not fulfill the
mitzvah of kiddush. By day, even if you do not want to eat the regular
meal immediately, you can recite the kiddush, and eat some cake, but
then you must drink a revi'is [of wine] from the cup in order to say the
berachah Al hamichyah ve'al peri hagafen, [for the food and for the fruit
of the vine.] This may also be done before Musaf, if one has a weak
heart. A mohel who must say a berachah on the cup [of wine drunk] at
the circumcision and has not yet recited kiddush, should first drink a
cheekful from the cup and an additional revi'is.

15

You are permitted to taste something after the Shacharis service, before
the Musaf service. Tasting is limited to a kebeitzah size piece of bread
and no more, but you may eat fruit in abundance in order to
strengthen yourself. However, you must recite kiddush first and drink a
cheekful [of wine] and then an additional revi'is of wine, (for in a time





of need this is considered kiddush at the place of the meal). You may
drink a revi'is of wine and eat a kazayis of food made of any of the five
species of grain as an alternative.
16

Every Jew, man or woman, is obligated to eat three meals on Shabbos,
one at night and two during the day. You must eat bread at each meal.
And even at the third meal you should be very meticulous to eat bread.
(And since you wash your hands and say a berachah on washing you
must eat a kebeitzah size piece of bread.) Therefore everyone should be
careful not to eat to excess at the morning meal in order to fulfill the
mitzvah of [eating] three meals. If it is impossible for you to eat bread
[at the third meal], you should at least eat cake or some other food
made from the five species of grain over which the berachah Borei minei
mezonos is said, for this [too] is considered food. And if this is also
impossible, you should at least eat things that are usually eaten with
bread such as meat or fish or similar things. And if this too is
impossible, you should at least eat cooked fruits. The time for eating
the third meal is from the time of Minchah Gedolah which is from six
and one-half hours [of the day] and after.

17

You are obligated to break bread over two whole loaves at each meal.
Both of them should be held in your hand when you make the
berachah Hamotzi and then one of them is broken. It is customary to
mark the loaf with the knife at the place you want to cut. The reason is
because on weekdays you must cut a little around the bread before
saying the berachah Hamotzi as it is written in chapter 41, paragraph 3.
On Shabbos, however, this cannot be done, because the loaves must be
whole when the berachah is said. Therefore you should at least mark
the place so that you know the exact spot to cut, without pausing too





long before deciding where to cut. You should place the loaves in such a
way that the one you want to cut is in front of you, so that you will not
need to pass over the mitzvah. And even if you eat many meals, you
must have two whole loaves at each meal. Similarly, when you say
kiddush in the morning before your regular meal, and you have cake,
you should also have two whole cakes.
18

If all those seated at the table are not provided with two whole loaves,
but only one of them [has two loaves], he should break [his two loaves]
[having in mind to] exempt the others. Similarly, regarding the
berachah Hamotzi, they are exempt with his berachah. Before saying
the berachah over the loaves, you should say: ""With the permission of
my teachers and masters."" And after you eat from the bread of the
motzi, you should give everyone a piece of bread and they too should
eat.

19

If you did not read the weekly portion of the Torah on Erev Shabbos,
you should not eat the Shabbos morning meal until you read it. And if
you did not read it before eating, you should at least read it before
Minchah. And post facto, you may read it until Tuesday night.

20

It is forbidden to fast on Shabbos for the sake of fasting, even for a
short time; and even if not intended as a fast, it is forbidden in any case
to fast until noon.

21

It is forbidden to grieve, heaven forbid, over any misfortune, may the
Merciful One save us, but you should seek mercy from the Merciful
One.




22


It is a mitzvah to partake generously of fruits and delicacies and to
enjoy fragrances in order to complete the total of one hundred
berachos. It is a mitzvah to delight in everything that gives you delight,
as it is said: ""And you shall call the Shabbos a delight.""

23

After the morning meal, if you are accustomed to sleep you may do so,
but do not say, ""I will sleep [now] because I have to do work or start on
a journey at night.""

24

After sleeping you should set a time for learning Torah. In the portion
of the Torah relating to Shabbos it is said: ""And Moshe assembled.""
And our Rabbis of blessed memory expounded: Why does it say in this
portion ""and he assembled,"" whereas it is not said thus elsewhere in the
entire Torah? The Holy One, blessed is He said to Moshe, Go down,
and make for Me large assemblies on Shabbos so that future generations
will learn [from you] to gather assemblies every Shabbos to learn Torah
in public. They said further, Shabbos and Yom Tov were given to Israel
only for the study of Torah, because many people are burdened during
the week with their daily tasks, and they have no time to engage in the
study of Torah regularly. However on Shabbos and Yom Tov when they
are free from their work they can learn Torah properly. Therefore
workers and laymen who are not engaged in Torah study during the
week, are more obligated to engage in the study of Torah on the holy
Shabbos, each man according to his understanding and ability.

1


When aliyahs are added on Shabbos a Kohen or Levi may be called for
the last aliyah, since the requirement of calling seven men was fulfilled,
and also because it is the last of the main aliyahs except for the maftir.
Similarly, for maftir, a Kohen or Levi may be called. It is even permitted
to call one Kohen for the last aliyah and one Kohen for maftir. They may
be called [in this situation] since the kaddish intervenes between them.
On Simchas Torah when three sifrei Torah are taken out, one Kohen
may be called as Chasan Torah, [the groom of the Torah] and one as
Chasan Bereishis, [the groom of Bereishis] and one for maftir, since each
one reads from a different seifer Torah. But when Rosh Chodesh Teivis
occurs on Shabbos, even though three sifrei Torah are taken out, even if
they want to call eight men to the first seifer Torah, it is not permitted
to call the Kohen to be the eighth one, since as yet [the required
reading] was not completed in this seifer. The reading is completed in
the second seifer in which the portion of Rosh Chodesh is read, and then
a Kohen may be called. The same law applies to Shabbos Shekalim and
to Parshas Hachodesh when they occur on Rosh Chodesh.

2

If a Kohen or Levi is called for one of the middle of the required aliyahs,
someone else, [a Yisrael] should go up in his place and he (the Kohen)
should wait near the bimah and go up for maftir or the last aliyah once
the required number [of seven] has been called.

3

On a Shabbos when two parshahs are read, the parshahs should be
merged with the reading of the fourth aliyah.

4

The curses contained in parshas Bechukosai, and in parshas Ki Savo
should be read without interruption. The reading of these curses must





be preceded by one verse of the preceding chapter. But in order not to
begin the parshah with less than three verses, the reading must begin
with the three verses preceding the curses. At the conclusion also, we
must read at least one verse after the curses, but care should be taken
not to end at less than three verses from the beginning of a parshah. In
parshas Ki Sisa, we read for the Levi, the whole chapter of the golden
calf until the words Umeshareso Yehoshua [and his servant Yehoshua].
And the reason is because the Levites did not participate in making the
golden calf. It is customary to read in a low voice [the portion
beginning with] Vayittein el Moshe kechaloso [and He gave Moses as He
had finished] until Vayechal Moshe [and Moses beseeched]. The verse
beginning with Vayechal is read in a loud voice until Vayifen vayeired
Moshe, [And Moses turned and descended]. And the verse beginning
with Vayifen is read in a low voice until uMoshe yikach es ha'ohel, [And
Moses took the tent]. The reading is then resumed in a loud voice until
the end of the parshah. And also the curses in parshas Bechukosai and
parshas Ki Savo should be read in a low voice. However, the verse,
Vezacharti es brisi Yaakov [And I will remember the covenant with
Jacob] is read in a loud voice. The following verse, Veha'aretz tei'azeiv
[And the land will be forsaken] is read in a low voice. From the verse:
Ve'af gam zos [and with all this] [the reading is resumed] in a loud voice
until the end. And in parshas Ki Savo, [the verse] Leyira es Hashem
hanichbad [to fear the honored Name] until the end of the verse should
be read in a loud voice and thereafter in a low voice until Ve'ein koneh
[and there is no one to buy]. Also in parshas Beha'alosecha it is
customary to read in a low voice from Vayehi ha'am kemisonenim [and
the people were as murmurers] until Vehaman kizra gad [and the
manna was like the coriander seed] and the reason is to show that they




were regretful. Whatever is read in a low voice should be read at least
[loud enough] for the congregation to hear the voice, otherwise they
have not fulfilled their duty of reading [the Torah]. [In the reading of ]
the forty-two journeys in parshas Masei no interruption should be
made, for they represent the [Divine] Name of forty-two [Letters].
5

Between one aliyah and the next the seifer Torah should be rolled up but
it need not be covered. But before maftir, when Kaddish is said and
there is a long interval, it should be covered with its mantle. Likewise,
on any other occasion when there is a long interval, as when a chant is
sung for a bridegroom [who is called to the Torah], or something
similar, [the seifer Torah should be covered]. And it would seem that this
rule also applies when much time is spent in saying Mishebeirach [He
Who blessed …].

6

If by mistake they read for the sixth [aliyah] to the end of the sidra,
Kaddish is not recited but the maftir is immediately called, and he also
completes the [required] number of seven persons (called up for
aliyahs). And after he has said the haftarah with its berachos, then the
kaddish is said. And on Yom Tov also, if by mistake they read for the
fourth aliyah until the end, the Kaddish is not recited but the maftir is
called up immediately to the second seifer Torah and after the haftarah
and its berachos, the Kaddish is recited.

7

When three sifrei Torah are needed [for the required reading] and only
two are available, the second [seifer] should not be rolled to read the
portion that must be read in the third [seifer], but rather the first [seifer]
should be taken for the reading [of that portion].




8


The laws concerning a defect discovered in a seifer Torah; were
explained in Chapter 24. If the defect is discovered during the reading
of the maftir; then, if this maftir is a special obligation for that day, such
as [the maftir] of Yom Tov or of Shabbos Rosh Chodesh or of [parshas]
Shekalim and the like, when an extra seifer Torah for maftir is taken out,
then the same law applies as for any other parshah. But on a regular
Shabbos, we repeat the reading of the seventh portion for the maftir.
We do this out of respect for the Torah, [so as not to create the
impression] that the honor of the Torah and the honor of the Prophets
are equal, for the one who reads in the Torah makes a berachah before
and after, and also the one who reads the Prophets makes a berachah
before and after; therefore it was ordained that the one called for maftir
reads in the Torah first to show that the reading of the Torah is the
main (reading). Therefore, another seifer Torah should not be taken out,
but the reading is concluded in the same seifer Torah. The concluding
berachah should not be said, but the haftarah and its berachos should
be said. If the defect was discovered before the first berachah was said, it
would seem that another seifer Torah should be taken out. If no other
seifer Torah is available then the one who was called up last should say
the haftarah with its berachos; and if the Kaddish has not yet been said,
it should be said after the haftarah.

9

In Chapter 24 paragraph 1, it was explained that if an error is
discovered of either a missing [letter] or an extra [letter], as long as it
does not alter either the pronunciation or the meaning [of the word],
another seifer Torah should not be taken out. However, if such an error
is discovered on Shabbos, even though another seifer Torah need not be
taken out; in any case to this seifer Torah they should not call more than





seven persons for an aliyah. The seventh person should read the
haftarah with its berachos and Kaddish is only said after the reading of
the haftarah and the berachos. (This rule applies to a regular Shabbos,
but when the maftir is the special obligation of that day, as was
discussed in the previous paragraph, then surely one must be called for
maftir). And at Minchah [this seifer Torah] should not be taken out.
10

If on a day when two sifrei Torah are taken out, a defect is discovered in
the first, and there is another seifer Torah in the Holy Ark, they should
not take the second seifer Torah to resume the reading, and after that
take out another seifer Torah [from the Ark] for the second reading.
This should not be done, because the reading should be done from the
seifer Torah that was set aside for it. [This law applies] also to a day on
which three sifrei Torah are taken out. Likewise, if the sifrei Torah were
switched by taking first the one that was intended for the later
[reading]; [then the one taken by mistake] should be rolled up, and the
second seifer taken from the Ark, in order to read from each seifer Torah
that portion for which it was intended.

11

[The following is] the order of precedence for those who are obligated
to have an aliyah: 1) A bridegroom on his wedding day. 2) A
bridegroom on the Shabbos before his wedding day [when he is called
to the Torah] when they sing for him, provided he has never been
married, and a lad who has become Bar Mitzvah during that week—
have equal rights [to an aliyah]. 3) A sandek on the day of the bris—he
is the one who holds the baby during the bris. 4) The sandek on the day
of the bris who brings the baby to the synagogue for the bris. 5) The
husband of a woman who gave birth to a girl when [the mother] comes
to the synagogue. 6) The husband of a woman who gave birth to a son,





and the mother comes to the synagogue. But if the woman does not
come to the synagogue, the husbands are not obliged [to have an
aliyah], unless it is the 41st day for a son or the 81st day for a daughter,
because it was on these days that a sacrifice was brought [in the Beis
Hamikdash]. 7) A bridegroom whose wedding took place on
Wednesday or later [in the week], on the Shabbos after the wedding,
but only if he had not been previously married or she had not been
previously married. 8) One who has Yahrzeit on that day. 9) The father
of the baby on the day of the circumcision. 10) One who will have
Yahrzeit during the week following the Shabbos. 11 ) The mohel on the
day of the circumcision. 12) The sandek and then the father of the
child, then the mohel on the Shabbos before the bris. Two people with
equal claim to an aliyah should depend on the discretion of the
president of the synagogue or they should decide by casting lots. A
non-resident cannot take precedence over any [resident] who is obliged
to have an aliyah. It is customary to call up to the Torah one who is
going on a journey after Shabbos or one who has returned from a
journey. Likewise, it is customary to honor an important guest by
calling him up [for an aliyah], but none of these takes precedence over
anyone who is obliged [to have an aliyah].
"
"1

Before the maftir is called to the Torah the half-Kaddish should be said.
During the recitation of the kaddish, the seifer Torah from which the
present reading was done and also the seifer Torah that will be used for
the maftir reading should both be on the reading desk. And on a day





that three sifrei Torah are used it is not necessary to place the first one
[on the bimah].
2

The one who has maftir should not begin the berachos of the haftarah
until after the one who rolls up the seifer Torah binds it in its wrapping
cloth.

3

In the first berachah, after the words hanemarim be'emes [which were
spoken in truth] Amein is not answered until the end, when the last
word vatzedek is said, because it is all one berachah. Similarly, after the
first segments of the concluding berachos, Amein is not said after the
words emes vatzedek [true and righteous] because [the segment
beginning with] ne'eman ata [you are faithful] is also part of this
berachah. And because there are some people who mistakenly answer
Amein in these places, it is better that the maftir not make any pauses
there, in order to indicate that the berachah does not end there.

4

It is forbidden to speak when the maftir reads the haftarah.

5

According to the basic law, only the maftir himself should say the
haftarah [aloud], and the congregation should repeat after him quietly.
And the custom whereby the congregation reads aloud together with
the maftir, stems only from ignorance, and this custom should be
abolished. There are some people who say the haftarah so slowly that
even after the maftir ends the haftarah and begins the berachos, they
don't want to stop saying the haftarah. These people are acting
improperly, because if they say it aloud, they, themselves, cannot hear
the words of the beginning berachos of the maftir, and they also
prevent their neighbors from hearing them. And even if they lower





their voices, a little at the beginning of the berachos, still they
themselves do not hear them. Therefore, the recommended practice is
that as soon as you hear that the maftir concludes the haftarah and
begins the berachos, even though you still did not finish, you should
wait silently until the maftir concludes the berachos, and after that you
should finish saying the haftarah. The maftir, too, should be careful not
to begin the berachos until the noisy sound of the congregation has
ended completely.
6

On a Shabbos when two sidrahs are joined, the haftarah is read of the
second sidrah except when Acharei and Kedoshim are joined, then the
haftarah Halo kivenei kushiyim, is read [Are you not as the children of
the Kushim?] In some chumashim it is noted that for the sidrah
Vayishlach the haftarah, Vayivrach Ya'akov [And Yaakov ran] should be
read, but this is an error, because this haftarah belongs to the sidrah
Vayeitzei and the haftarah of Vayishlach is Chazon Ovadyah [The vision
of Ovadyah].

7

When Rosh Chodesh occurs on Shabbos, the haftarah Hashamayim Kis'i
is read [The heavens are My throne]. If, by mistake, the haftarah of the
weekly sidrah was read, [if the reader becomes aware of it] before he
said the concluding berachos, he should also read Hashamayim kis'i and
then say the berachos. If he only became aware of it after saying the
berachos, he should say Hashamayim kis'i, without the berachos. If Rosh
Chodesh occurs on a Sunday, the haftarah, Machar chodesh is read
[Tomorrow is the new moon]. If [the reader] made an error, the same
halachah applies as that of Shabbos Rosh Chodesh. If Rosh Chodesh occurs
on Shabbos and Sunday, the haftarah Hashamayim kis'i is read.




8


On Shabbos of Chol Hamo'eid Pesach no mention is made in the
berachos of the haftarah of anything relating to Pesach, either in the
middle or at the end [of the concluding berachos]; but they should be
concluded with Mekadeish haShabbos [Who sanctifies the Shabbos].
But on Chol Hamo'eid Sukkos (since the complete Halleil is then said
and there is a difference in the daily sacrifices,) mention is made [of the
Yom Tov] just as it is done on the Yom Tov days of Sukkos when they
fall on Shabbos.

9

A minor who has reached the age of chinuch and knows to whom the
berachos are directed, and can articulate the letters well, may be called
up for maftir on Shabbos and on Yom Tov, except on parshas Zachor, on
parshas Parah, and on Shabbos Shuvah. Likewise, on the seventh day of
Pesach, when the shirah is read for the haftarah, it is customary not to
call a minor to go up for maftir. Likewise, on the first day of Shavuos
when the haftarah is read of the merkavah, the chariot in Ezekiel, it is
customary to call up only an adult who is a Torah scholar. Likewise, on
Shabbos Chazan it is customary to call up the Rabbi for maftir.

10

Reading the haftarah with berachos was instituted only after the reading
of the Torah with berachos, and all the required aliyahs [has been
completed]. But if a defect is found in the seifer Torah on a regular
Shabbos, even during the seventh aliyah, and there was no other seifer
Torah available, and therefore the concluding berachah was not said, or
when the maftir is read, relating to the subject of the day, even if [the
defect] is discovered in the maftir, then no berachos are said on the
haftarah, but it should be read without berachos. But on a regular
Shabbos, if after seven men were called, [all of whom recited] the





berachos, the defect is found, whether while reading for the added
aliyahs or while reading the maftir, it seems that the haftarah should be
read with the berachos.
"
"1

The principal melachos which we are forbidden to do on Shabbos are already known
to most of the Jewish people. Thus, we will list only those things which are not
generally known [to be forbidden] and are done in our daily activities.

It is forbidden to use the light of an oil lamp for anything that requires
concentration. This is a rabbinic prohibition, lest you forget and tilt the
lamp to draw the oil closer to the wick, thereby violating [the deoraisa
prohibition of ] lighting a fire. Two people may read the same subject
from the same book together, for if one attempts to tilt the lamp, the
other one will remind him. [Studying by the light of ] our present day
candles in which the wax or tallow adhere to the wicks, is permitted,
but you must make some sort of mark in order to remember not to snip
off the charred end of the wick which, according to the opinion of the
Rambam, is a deoraisa prohibition. Even through a non-Jew, it is
forbidden to snip off the tip of the wick.
2

It is forbidden to open a door or window directly opposite and close to
a burning candle lest the flame be extinguished. But it is permitted to
close a door or window [even in such circumstances]. The door of an
oven in which a fire is burning must not be opened or closed, for by
doing so, the fire is either increased or extinguished.




3


It is forbidden to pour hot gravy on pieces of bread or matzos, rather
you should first pour the gravy into a dish, and let it cool until it is fit
to eat. After that you may put in the bread or matzos. However, as long
as the gravy is hot, even if it is in the dish [which is a keli sheini], it is
forbidden to put in bread or matzos. You should also not put salt or
spices into the [hot] gravy, even if it is in a dish [keli sheini] and,
certainly, not into the pot [keli rishon] as long as it is hot. But (you)
should wait until it cools off, until it is fit to eat. If the salt was
processed through boiling, some are lenient [and permit it], but he who
adheres to the stricter view, will be blessed. Likewise, you should not
pour hot coffee or tea into a cup that you wish to drink from if it
contains sugar; rather, you should first pour in the coffee or tea and
then put in the sugar. When there is a necessity, you may be lenient.

4

It is forbidden to place fruit or water on a hot stove because the water
might boil and the fruit might bake. Even if your intention is only to
warm them a little, nevertheless, if on this place it is possible that they
will boil or bake, it is forbidden to warm them there. Likewise, pudding
(kugel) containing fat should not be placed near a fire or on an oven in
a place where it may boil, even if you intend only to warm it. But in a
place where it cannot be cooked but only warmed somewhat, you are
permitted to place it, even if the fat is congealed or the water is frozen.
But in an oven in which food is kept warm, it is forbidden to put
anything cold for the purpose of warming, even if it cannot boil there.
If it is needed for one who is slightly ill, a halachic authority should be
consulted. There are some who are accustomed to replace foods into the
oven on Shabbos where they had been kept warm, since they are still





warm. But if they cooled off completely, it is forbidden to do so. A
spiritually sensitive person should be stringent in all such cases.
5

On Shabbos it is forbidden to warm food, by wrapping it in anything
[that insulates], (even if it does not increase its warmth). Therefore, if
you remove a pot containing food that was cooked or warmed in it, it is
forbidden to wrap it or cover it with pillows or cushions, etc. to
preserve its warmth.

6

Food that cannot be eaten at all without being rinsed, is forbidden to
be rinsed on Shabbos, even with cold water. Salted fish [herring] may
be soaked in cold water for even before soaking, it is edible.

7

It is forbidden to put vinegar into mustard, horseradish, and other
relishes on Shabbos, in which no vinegar was put while it was still day
(before Shabbos). It is permitted if you do it in an irregular manner;
that is, you must first put the vinegar into a dish, and afterwards put in
the mustard or horseradish. You should not make a thick mixture, but
you must pour enough vinegar into it so that the mixture is thin. You
may not mix it with a spoon or anything similar, but with your finger,
or you may shake the vessel until the contents are well mixed.

8

Fruit found lying under a tree [on Shabbos], must not even be moved,
for it may have fallen off that very day. Similarly, all fruits of a non-Jew,
if there is a possibility that they were picked that day, must not even be
moved.

9

It is forbidden to remove honey from a beehive. It is also forbidden to
crush honeycombs, even if they were removed from the hive before
Shabbos. If the honeycomb was not crushed before Shabbos, the honey





that flows from it on Shabbos is forbidden. But honey flowing from the
hive itself is permitted (to be eaten on Shabbos).
10

Fruit that was scattered in one place in the house or yard, may be
gathered together. But if they are scattered all about, when it is a bother
to gather them, it is forbidden to gather them into a basket, but you
may pick them up and eat them [one by one].

11

Concerning legumes [peas] in their pods (which are called sharvitin),
when their pods are fresh and edible, you may open them and remove
[the peas] from the pod, (for this is considered separating food from
food) [which is permitted]. But if the pods have become dry and are no
longer edible, it is forbidden to remove the peas from them. Similarly,
you must be careful not to remove nut (kernels) from their (soft) green
(outer) shell or sesame seeds from their shells.

12

It is forbidden to squeeze fruit for their juice. Therefore, it is forbidden
to squeeze lemons into water to make lemonade. And even to suck the
juice into your mouth is forbidden according to some poskim. You
should be careful at least when eating grapes, not to suck out the juice
and discard the skins. If you do not need the juice, it is permitted to
squeeze it out. Therefore, you may squeeze out lettuce or cucumbers
[pickles], since the water goes to waste.

13

A woman may not squeeze milk from her breasts into a cup or pot and
feed her child with it, but she may squeeze out a little milk to facilitate
the baby's nursing. It is forbidden to sprinkle some of her milk on
something for the sake of a remedy where there is no danger involved
and no intense pain.




14


It is permitted to place congealed fat upon hot food even though it
melts. You may not crush snow or hail by hand, breaking them into
pieces so that their water oozes out; but you may put [ice] into a cup of
wine or water to chill it, letting the ice melt of itself. In the winter, you
should be careful not to wash your hands with water containing snow
or hailstones. If you did, you should be careful not to squeeze them
with your hands, in order not to crush them. It is permissible to break
ice in order to take water from underneath. Urinating in snow should
be avoided if possible. Likewise, you should be careful not to urinate on
mud or soft dirt.

15

When food is mixed with pesoles, you may separate [select] the food
from the pesoles, but not the pesoles from the food. And even separating
food from pesoles is forbidden when using a utensil. It is permitted only
by hand, and only for the purpose of eating it immediately. Even foods
which you select to eat now, from food which will be left for later use,
care must be taken to select only what is to be eaten now, and not to
select that which will be left over, because the part to be eaten now is
considered food and the part to be left over is considered pesoles. Even
peeling garlic or onions and putting them away is prohibited, because
of boreir (selecting). You are permitted to peel only what you need for
eating now. The outermost peel of the garlic, that surrounds the whole
cluster must not be removed even to eat the garlic now, because it is
considered mefareik, a toldah [offshoot melachah] of dosh (threshing).

16

Even non-edible items are included in the prohibition of boreir
(selection), such as utensils etc.; whatever you need for immediate use is
considered food and the rest is considered waste.




17


It is forbidden to strain any liquid because it involves many halachic
details. However, it is permitted to drink through a cloth, for the law of
boreir applies only to improvements made prior to eating or drinking,
but in this case (of drinking through a cloth), you are merely
preventing the pesoles from entering your mouth. Nevertheless,
drinking water through a cloth is prohibited by some poskim because it
constitutes washing (the cloth). But you can be lenient in an urgent
situation where there is no pure water to drink. However, you should
not drink through your shirt sleeve for fear that you will wring out [the
sleeve].

18

A coffee (beverage) which has coffee grounds on the bottom, which is
pesoles, or any other beverage that has dregs on the bottom, or other
pesoles, when you pour from it, care must be taken not to pour off all
the clear liquid, but you must leave a little with the pesoles. In the case
of milk that has curdled, it is forbidden to remove the top which is
called butterfat, unless it is needed for the immediate meal, and even in
this case, you must be careful not to remove all of it, rather leave some
of it on the milk which is on the bottom.

19

If a fly or other insect fell into food or beverage, it is forbidden to
remove just the fly itself; but you must, remove some of the food or
beverage with it and discard it with the fly.

20

If you must crush pepper or salt, and similar items, to put into food,
you may crush (them) with the handle of a knife on the table, or with
similar methods. But not with a mortar and pestle, or with a hand-mill.




21


It is forbidden to cut up onions and other vegetables, except
immediately before a meal and even then, they should not be cut very
fine.

22

It is forbidden to salt anything which will become soft or less pungent
because of the salt. This is similar to (the melachah of ) me'abeid
[tanning]. Therefore, it is forbidden to salt raw cucumbers. It is also
forbidden to salt radishes or onions, even if they are needed for that
meal, but you may dip each piece in salt and eat them. Eggs, cooked
meat, and other foods that are not affected by salt, except that it gives
them a salty flavor, may be salted to be eaten at that meal. It is
forbidden to salt them for another meal.

23

You may not salt a large quantity of cooked beans and legumes
together, because salting helps to soften them; and even if you intend to
eat them immediately, it is forbidden.

24

Cucumber salad, and other relishes made from onions, may be salted
immediately before the meal, since the oil and vinegar which are added
immediately weaken the strength of the salt. But it is forbidden to salt
them and leave them stand for a while.

25

The prohibition of ""Building"" applies also to foods, such as making
hard cheese or arranging fruits in an orderly fashion. Therefore, when
cutting onions for eggs or for creamed herring, you should be careful
not to shape them and decorate them, rather put them on the plate as
they are.




26


When washing dishes in boiling water, you should not pour the water
on the dishes, rather, pour the water into another vessel and then put
the dishes into the vessel. Dishes must not be washed with a cloth
because of the prohibition of squeezing, but you may wash them with a
cloth used especially for this purpose, since you are not concerned to
wring it out, even on weekdays. Glass dishes must not be washed with
oats or similar detergents. It is forbidden to wash dishes on Shabbos
other than those [actually] needed for Shabbos.

27

Whatever is forbidden to be done on Shabbos by a Jew, is also
forbidden to be done for him through a non-Jew. Nevertheless, in the
winter, since it is permitted to light the oven in order to heat the house
through a non-Jew, the custom is that the non-Jew [is permitted] to
place the cold food on the oven before he lights it, and then light it.
Since lighting the oven is not intended for heating the food, but rather
for heating the house some (poskim) permit this; but only if he (the
non-Jew) put on the food before lighting the oven and not after.
Certainly if lighting (the oven) is not intended for the sake of heating
the house, but for the food, it is forbidden in any manner. Some
(poskim) forbid this even if the intent is to heat the house. Even though
the custom is to rely on the poskim who permit it, nevertheless, a
scrupulous person should be stringent when it is not very urgent. And
certainly this is the case with iron ovens which are made especially for
cooking purposes. Although people light them on Shabbos to heat their
homes, and the non-Jew puts on the food before lighting it,
nevertheless, a God-fearing Jew should abstain from this practice.




28


Anyone who spills liquid on soil where something grows is guilty of
violating the law against sowing, for the liquid causes the soil to sprout.
Therefore, you should be mindful not to eat (a meal) in a garden;
because it is difficult to prevent the spilling of some liquid on the soil,
and, besides, it is forbidden to carry in a garden.

29

A sponge that has no handle must not be used for wiping [a table].

30

It is forbidden to spit in a place where the wind will scatter the saliva.

31

A girl is forbidden to braid her hair on Shabbos and she must not undo
her braids, but she may fix her hair with her hands. Regarding combs
made from hogs' hair, —If the bristles are very hard, so that it is
impossible not to tear out hairs, it is forbidden to comb with it, but if it
is not so hard, she is permitted to set her hair with it. And it is certainly
[permitted] if it is set aside for that purpose.

32

A garment or anything similar that is soiled, may be wiped with a rag
or something similar, but water may not be spilled on it because spilling
water on it is equivalent to washing. Therefore, if a child urinates on a
garment, it is forbidden to pour water on it. (But if he urinates on the
ground or on a wooden vessel or hide, it is permitted to pour water on
it.) When you wash your hands and want to dry them with a towel, you
should rub your hands together well, to remove the water, so that only
a little water remains on them; (for the little water that you dry is
considered soiling and is not considered washing). When a colored
towel is used there is no cause for concern in any case, (since such a
towel is not likely to be washed in this manner).




33


If a barrel contains water or other liquids, it is forbidden to cover it
with a cloth which is not set aside to cover it, lest it be wrung out. But
with a cloth set aside for this purpose, it is permitted to cover it, for
since it is set aside for that purpose, we have no reason to fear that it
will be wrung.

34

If water spilled on the table or any similar surface, it is forbidden to
wipe it with a garment which you value, for since it absorbs much
water you might wring it out. Similarly, you may not use a towel to dry
cups or other vessels having a narrow opening, because the liquid will
be squeezed out of the towel.

35

If you were walking in the rain and your clothing got wet, you are
permitted to go home, but when you remove [your clothes], it is
forbidden to spread them out to dry. Even if they were only moist from
perspiration, it is forbidden to spread them out and certainly it is
forbidden to spread them out (to dry) near a fire. Even if you are
wearing them, it is forbidden to stand near the fire where it is very hot.
It is likewise forbidden to shake off the water from the garment. A
garment of which you take special care lest it get wet, is forbidden to be
handled even after taking it off for fear you might squeeze out the
water.

36

If you are walking and reach a stream, you may jump over it even if it is
[a bit] wide. It is better to jump over it than to bypass it, because
(bypassing) increases the [effort of the] journey. It is forbidden to pass
through the stream, lest you wring your clothes after crossing. It is





forbidden to walk on Shabbos in any place where you might slip and
fall into water lest your clothes get soaked and you will wring them out.
37

If your are going to do a mitzvah, such as greeting your father or your
rebbe or someone greater in Torah wisdom than you, you may cross the
river, provided you do so in an unusual manner. For example, do not
remove your hands from underneath your overcoat, so that you will
remember not to wring [the clothes]. It is forbidden to cross (a stream)
wearing sandals, for since you cannot secure them and fasten them well,
they may fall off and you will carry them. But you may (cross the
stream) in your shoes. Once you go for the purpose of doing a mitzvah
you may also return [the same way]. If you are going to guard your
fruit, (watching over your property is also somewhat of a mitzvah), you
may (cross the stream) on the way there but not when you return.

38

Wet mud on a garment, may be scraped off with a fingernail or a knife,
but if it is dry, it is forbidden to scrape it, for that would be similar to
""Grinding.""

39

It is forbidden to shake dust or snow from a black garment, but it is
permitted to remove a feather from it. Some (poskim) rule that this too
is forbidden.

40

Mud that is on your foot or your shoe may be removed with something
which is permitted to be handled [on Shabbos], or they may be wiped
on a beam. They may not be wiped on a wall or on the ground. If there
is an urgent need, as when there is excrement on your foot, or on your
shoe, and there is nothing available which may be handled on Shabbos,
they may be wiped on a wall. If there is no wall they may be wiped on





the ground. And if water is available, the shoe may be washed even in
water if it is made of leather. (For in the case of leather, mere splashing
of [water] is not considered washing unless the two ends are rubbed
together in the manner of launderers.) But it is forbidden to use a knife
to scrape off mud or excrement from a leather shoe. If the iron (post) in
front of the house, that is made for cleaning shoes, is sharp, it is
forbidden to scrape shoes with it; if it is not sharp it is permitted.
41

If your hands become soiled with mud you should not wipe them on a
hand towel, (lest you forget and rinse it).

42

It is forbidden to dye anything even with a dye that is not permanent.
Therefore a woman is forbidden to color her face. Care must be taken
when your hands are colored by the fruits you have eaten, not to touch
your garment, because it will become dyed. Likewise, blood from your
nose or blood from a wound should not be wiped on a kerchief.

43

You may not put saffron into your (cooked) food because it colors
[dyes] it. (And so it is written in the sefer Chayei Adam [24: 5] .)

44

It is forbidden to braid or weave even two threads, or two loose hairs
[on Shabbos].

45

Usually when we want to tie something with two strings or ropes, or
when we wind around a string or rope, and tie the two ends together
like a belt, we tie a double knot because a single knot will not hold. It is
forbidden to tie a double knot on Shabbos, even on something that is
usually untied the same day. [Therefore] you must be careful when
wrapping a scarf around the neck, not to make a double knot. Similarly
on Friday [erev Shabbos] you should not make a double knot, for if you





do, it is forbidden to untie it on Shabbos, as discussed below. Similarly,
to make even one knot at one end of a string or rope, or to hold the
two ends together, and make one knot on both of them is forbidden,
since with this method even a single knot holds strongly. It is permitted
to take the two ends together, tie them with a single knot and a loop on
top, if it is something that is usually untied the same day. If not, it is
forbidden, even if you intend to untie it the same day. But making two
loops, one on top of the other, is permitted, [and it is permitted to
make] even many loops even if it is intended that they remain for many
days.
46

A knot which you are forbidden to tie is also forbidden to be untied. If
it causes discomfort it may be untied by a non-Jew.

47

It is the custom of tailors before sewing a garment to connect the pieces
with long basting stitches, and afterward remove the threads from these
stitches. It is forbidden to remove them on Shabbos.

48

Some garments are made so that a string or strap may be inserted in
them such as pants, shoes, or a robe. If it is a new garment it is
forbidden to insert them, because it is like perfecting a vessel. If it is
old, and the hole is not narrow, so that there is no bother inserting [the
string], it is permitted. If it is bothersome, it is forbidden.

49

When a stitch becomes loose and the parts of the garment become a bit
separated, if the thread is pulled, the loose parts will tighten and hold
together. It is forbidden to do this on Shabbos because this is
considered sewing.




50


If sheets of paper were stuck together unintentionally, as the pages of a
book sometimes stick together from the paint [or glue] used by the
bookbinder, or if some pages were stuck together by wax, it is permitted
to open them.

51

If the openings of vessels were covered with a cloth and tied with a
string, it is permitted to tear them open on Shabbos, for this is
considered spoiling, and it is permissible when needed for Shabbos.

52

It is forbidden to catch any living creature on Shabbos. It is forbidden
even to catch a flea [on Shabbos]. But if it is on your body and it is
biting you, since it causes you physical discomfort, it may be removed
and thrown away. It is forbidden to kill it because it is forbidden to kill
any living creature [on Shabbos]. [It is, however, permitted to kill] lice
since they are created only by perspiration. Nevertheless, those found in
clothing must not be killed, rather they should be removed and thrown
away. Only lice found in the head may be killed.

53

You must take care when closing a box or vessel in which there are flies,
to let them fly out first, because when you close it they will be trapped
there. However, it is not necessary to examine the box to see that none
are left, it is sufficient to chase away those you see.

54

It is forbidden to draw blood [on Shabbos]; it is forbidden even to suck
blood from the gums. It is also forbidden to dress a wound with a
dressing that draws out blood and pus. It is certainly forbidden to
squeeze a wound to draw out blood or pus.




55


If tzitzin, shreds of skin, become separated from the skin around the
fingernail, it is forbidden to remove them either by means of an
instrument or by hand, or with the teeth. A nail, most of which has
been separated and is almost torn off, and causes discomfort, may be
removed by hand, but not with an instrument. If most of it was not
separated, it is forbidden to remove it even by hand.

56

It is forbidden to pour other liquids into vinegar so that they too
become vinegar.

57

Meat that was not salted (Kashered) and its third day occurs on
Shabbos and if it is not rinsed [now] it will be forbidden, may be rinsed
by a non-Jew, but it is forbidden for a Jew to do so.

58

It is forbidden to smear plaster or wax or tar. Therefore, it is forbidden
to put wax or congealed oil into a hole to close it, or to stick it onto
something for a marker. But it is permitted to smear food, like butter
on bread or similar things.

59

It is forbidden to break or cut anything that is not food; but it is
permitted to cut food, even animal food. Therefore you may cut straw
to pick your teeth. Fragrant woods may be crushed and broken in order
to smell them even if they are as hard as wood. But you may not break
them to pick your teeth.

60

A tree, be it green or dried up, may not be used for any purpose, even if
you do not shake it. (Because shaking the tree is in itself a violation of
muktzeh.) You may not climb on it nor hang on it. It is forbidden to
place any article on it or remove anything from it, or to tie an animal to





it, or to make any other use of it. And even the sides of the tree are
forbidden to be used. Therefore, if a basket is hanging on it, it is
forbidden to take anything from the basket or to place anything into it,
for the basket is (considered) the side of the tree. But if a spike is driven
into a tree and a basket is suspended from it, it is permissible to take
things from it or to put (things) into it, because the basket is then
considered the side of the side [of the tree]. It is forbidden to remove
the basket from it or to hang the basket on the spike, because you
would be making use of the spike which is the side of the tree.
61

If a vessel is used for planting herbs or roses for their beauty or
fragrance; it is forbidden to pluck them from the vessel just as it is
forbidden to pluck them from a tree. Care must be taken [that such a
vessel] not be moved from the ground to set it in another place, because
when it stands on the ground it is nourished from the aroma of the soil,
therefore removing it from there is like plucking [something from the
ground]. Similarly, if it is standing in another place, it is forbidden to
remove it and place it on the ground, because doing this is equivalent
to planting. You must be diligent in all these matters, whether the vessel
is of wood or of clay, and whether there is an opening on the bottom or
not.

62

It is forbidden to write or draw any form, even with your finger, with
liquid [spilled] on the tabletop, or with the condensation on a glass
window, or with anything else, even if it is not of a permanent nature.
Even to make a mark with your fingernail upon an object for a sign is
forbidden. If wax or something similar is found on a book, even if it is
only on one letter, it is forbidden to remove it.




63


Just as it is forbidden to write, so is it forbidden to erase any writing.
However, cakes upon which letters or figures were made, are permitted
to be broken and eaten on Shabbos; but if they were made as a charm
for children, you should be machmir (stringent).

64

Books upon which the edges of the pages have written words, according
to some (poskim), are forbidden to be opened or closed on Shabbos, but
other (poskim) permit it, and such is the custom. However, since some
poskim forbid it it is best not to write on the edges of pages.

65

You are permitted to say to a friend, ""Fill up this vessel for me,"" even
though it is specifically used for measuring, and even if it belongs to the
seller, so long as [you] the customer, takes it home. And certainly if the
customer, brings his own vessel and says, ""Fill up this vessel for me,"" it
is surely permitted. However, it is forbidden to measure in a measuring
vessel that belongs to the seller, and empty it into the customer's vessel.
It is permissible to say to your friend, ""Give me fifty nuts"" etc. provided
you do not mention any measure or money, and you also make no
calculation saying, ""I owe you for fifty nuts, give me another fifty nuts
and I will owe you for a hundred."" Certainly you should not speak in
terms of sale, even if you do not set the price, and even if it is for
Shabbos needs. It is forbidden to make purchases on Shabbos, [even]
through a non-Jew and the same law applies to renting.

66

You are permitted to say to a friend, ""Fill up this vessel for me or fill it
up until this mark and tomorrow we will measure it or weigh it.""

67

Just as it is forbidden to erect even a temporary building on Shabbos, so
too is it forbidden to add even a temporary addition to a permanent





structure. There is a halachic question regarding a door made for a
doorway which is not used frequently for entrance and exit except on
rare occasions. A door which does not swing on pivots or on hinges but
rather was attached and suspended there, may be used to close [the
opening], so long as there is a hinge on the door, or even if there is no
hinge at present, but it had one that was broken and the place where it
was is still discernible. Even if the door is such that when it is opened, it
drags on the ground and in order to close it it must be raised and
placed on the threshold, it is nevertheless permissible. (The reason is)
since it is attached and suspended and there is also a mark of a hinge, it
is obvious that it is a door used for closing and opening, and it does not
appear as construction. Certainly this is true if it still has a hinge,
provided that you do not slip the hinge into place, for this would be
considered (the melachah of ) building.
68

But if there is no mark of a hinge, it is forbidden to close an opening
with it on Shabbos. For since it is made to open only on rare occasions,
and it is not obvious that it is used as a door, closing it is equivalent to
building. But if it is attached and suspended well so that when it is
opened it does not drag on the ground, even if it is suspended above
the ground only a hairbreadth, it is clearly a door and it is permissible
to close the opening with it.

69

If it is not attached and suspended at all, and upon opening it, it is
removed entirely, it is absolutely forbidden to use it to close an opening
not made for regular entrance and exit. But if it is an opening which is
made for regular entrance and exit, it is permitted to close the doorway
with it, even if there is no mark of a hinge on it.




70


A door made of one (wooden) plank, may not be used to close a
doorway that is not used for regular entrance and exit, even if it has a
hinge, but it does not swing on its hinge, for since it is made of only
one plank and it does not swing on its hinge, it appears like building
and closing up an open space. But if an opening is made for regular
entrance and exit, you may be lenient and close the doorway with it
provided there is a doorsill, for then it is obvious that it is a doorway.

71

A window shutter such as a plank or anything else with which a
window is shut, may be used to shut the window even if it is not
attached there, provided that it has already been used once to shut the
window before Shabbos, or you had in mind to shut the window with
it before Shabbos. However, if it was never used to shut the window,
and you did not have in mind to do so, it is forbidden to shut a
window with it on Shabbos, if it is a thing which is customarily left
there for a long time. But something which is customarily left there
only for a short time, such as a garment or the like, is permitted to be
used for shutting under all circumstances.

72

Doors and windows even when they hang on iron hinges, and are easily
removed and reset, nevertheless, it is forbidden to remove them or to
hang them on Shabbos, for one who hangs them is [in violation of ]
building and the one who removes them is [in violation of ] demolition.

73

It is forbidden to sweep the house even if the floor is made of stone or
wood. But when a non-Jew does it, it is permitted. If you do it in an
entirely unusual manner, such as using the feathers of a goose wing, or
something similar, it is permitted even for a Jew.




74


You may not rub saliva on the ground with your foot, but you may step
on it without rubbing it.

75

It is forbidden to relieve yourself in a plowed field on Shabbos. (If it is
someone else's field, it is forbidden to enter it [for such a purpose] even
on weekdays, as stated in Chapter 183: 5.)

76

It is forbidden to make even a temporary partition, on Shabbos or Yom
Tov if it is for the purpose of permitting something. Therefore it is
forbidden to make a partition with a curtain or anything similar to
block out the light of a candle in order to permit marital relations, or in
front of seforim in order to have marital relations or (to permit) moving
the bowels; for since the partition legalizes [these activities] it creates a
separate domain and it is equivalent to making a tent. However, it is
permitted to cover the seforim with two coverings, one on top of the
other for this does not constitute making a tent. If the curtain that
hangs in front of the bed was spread out [at least] one tefach before
Shabbos, whether from the side or from the top, it is permitted to
spread all of it on Shabbos, because then it is only an addition to a
temporary tent. But the ruffled part of the curtain which always hangs
at one end [of the bed] is not included in the tefach, because it is not
intended to serve as a tent. Similarly, a partition called a ""Spanish wall""
is forbidden to be opened unless it was slightly opened from erev
Shabbos. But the part that is always folded, even if that part of the wall
is more than a tefach, cannot be considered. But a temporary partition
that is not made to permit (anything) but rather to serve as a shield
from the sun or to prevent wind from blowing out the candle, etc., is
permitted.




77


A tent, even if it is made only to shield from the sun or from the rain;
and even if it is only a temporary tent, if it is one tefach by one tefach
and one tefach high it is forbidden to be made on Shabbos. Therefore,
it is forbidden to spread a sheet over a baby's crib that has wooden
hoops on the top upon which a sheet is spread, unless at least a tefach
was spread before Shabbos, [in which case] the remainder is only an
addition to a temporary tent, which is permitted. If the hoops were
close to each other, and were less than three tefachim apart, they are in
themselves considered a tent, (for it is a law given [orally] to Moses on
Mount Sinai that any space less than three tefachim is considered lavud,
which means connected and closed) and it is permissible to spread a
sheet over them.

78

It is forbidden to remove the cover of a box [trunk] which is not
attached with hinges, because it is equivalent to demolishing a tent.
And likewise it is forbidden to cover the box with it because it is like
making a tent. When placing a board on an [open] barrel to serve as a
table, you must place the barrel with its open side on the bottom,
because if you place the board on the open side, you will be making a
tent.

79

If a chimney has its opening on the side, so that closing it is like adding
to a partition, it is permissible to close it. But if the opening is on top
of the chimney, it is forbidden to close it on Shabbos and Yom Tov
because it is like making a tent. If an iron door is installed there that
swings on hinges, it is permissible to close it, for since it is installed
there it is like (any) door that swings on hinges.




80


If a garment was spread over the opening of a barrel and the barrel is
not entirely full, but there is an empty space of tefach between the
beverage and the cover, you should not cover it completely because it is
like (making) a tent, but rather leave a little of the opening uncovered.

81

Any partition or tent which you are forbidden to make [on Shabbos],
once it is made, you are forbidden to remove it, for it is like
demolishing a tent.

82

It is forbidden to carry a covering that is made to protect from the sun
or rain, which is called an umbrella, [because when you open it] it is
considered making a tent.

83

When vessels made of different sections inserted into one another
became separated, if they were usually joined loosely, it is permissible to
put them back, but if they were usually joined tightly, it is forbidden to
put them back even loosely. Similarly if they were joined by means of
screws, since they are usually joined tightly, if they became separated, it
is forbidden to join them even loosely. However, it is permissible to
remove pot covers and to put them on, since they are not made to
remain there, but rather to be opened and closed constantly.

84

When a press is made of two boards one on top of the other, between
which clothes are pressed, if it is a household press it is permissible to
open it to take out clothes needed for Shabbos and Yom Tov. But you
may not press clothing in it, for you would be doing it for weekday
needs. If it is a launderer's press or that of another craftsman, it is
forbidden to be opened, for since it is joined together strongly, opening
it is like demolition. Even if the press was opened before Shabbos it is





forbidden to take clothing from there on Shabbos or Yom Tov. This is a
gezeirah (rabbinic decree) lest you open it on Shabbos.
85

If the leg of a stool came out, it is forbidden to put it back, and it is also
forbidden to lean the stool on another stool unless you previously sat
on it in this manner. However, it is permissible to place a board on
stools, or on pieces of wood that you prepared erev Shabbos for that
(purpose).

86

It is forbidden to wind even an ongoing clock on Shabbos and Yom Tov
to prevent it from stopping. On the second day of Yom Tov you may be
lenient, so long as it is still going. It may be wound [only] for the need
of Yom Tov but not for the next day. For a sick person it is permitted in
any case, if a non-Jew cannot easily be found to do it.

87

It is forbidden to make a musical sound with an instrument on
Shabbos, or with the limbs of your body, (except the mouth). It is even
forbidden to snap your fingers, or tap them on a board to make a
sound, or to rattle a nut, or to ring a bell to silence a crying child. It is
forbidden to clap or to dance. [However] in the honor of the Torah it is
permissible to clap and dance. Also if someone does it to silence a
crying child, you should not protest for there are (poskim) who permit
it.

88

It is permitted to make non-musical sounds. Therefore it is permissible
to knock on a door so that it will be opened for you, and similar things
[are also permitted]. Some authorities hold that it is nevertheless
forbidden to make noise with a special instrument such as knocking on
a door with the knocker attached to it or to ring the bell set up for that





purpose. Similarly, those clocks that are made to strike the hours by
means of pressing them, or by pulling a special chain, may not be
operated as such on Shabbos or Yom Tov.
89

If you are guarding fruits or grain against animals and birds, you may
not clap your hands, nor slap your hands on your thighs, nor stamp
your feet to chase them away as you would do on weekdays.

90

It is not permitted to play with nuts or the like on the ground, even if
covered by a floor. You should nevertheless not protest against women
and children (who do it), for they will certainly not listen, and it is
better that they err unintentionally rather than intentionally.

91

In reference to folding clothing there are many halachic intricacies and
you should (therefore) not fold any garment.

92

If a garment is caught on fire it is permissible to spill any kind of
beverage on the spot which is not yet burning, so that when the fire
reaches the wet part it will be extinguished, but it is forbidden to spill
water on the garment.

93

You may not make your bed on Shabbos for use after Shabbos. Even if
there is still time left in the day during which you can sleep while it is
still Shabbos, nevertheless, since it is not your intention to sleep on it
until after Shabbos, you are preparing something on Shabbos for
weekdays, and this is forbidden.

There are four classes of domains with regard to the laws of Shabbos:
private domain, public domain, karmelis and makom petur. We shall
explain them briefly.

2

What is a private domain? It is a place that is at least four tefachim by
four tefachim (which is sufficiently significant to be of use) and is
surrounded by partitions at least ten tefachim high (even if the
partitions are not complete). A trench, ten tefachim deep and four
tefachim wide, has the same halachah as a partition. Similarly, the same
is true of a hole ten [tefachim] deep, and four tefachim by four tefachim
wide, and also a mound ten tefachim high and four tefachim by four
tefachim wide. Even a vessel such as a box, if it is ten [tefachim] high, or
a round barrel that is large enough to circumscribe a four by four
square; all of these, even if they are in a public domain or in a karmelis,
are considered separate premises of their own and constitute a private
domain. The open space over a private domain is considered a private
domain until the sky. The tops of the walls that surround a private
domain, are also considered a private domain. If there are holes in the
walls on the side facing a private domain, even if they run through
from side to side, since they can be used from the private domain, they
are insignificant in comparison to the wall [and therefore] are
considered as a private domain. (When the holes are only on the
outside of the wall, this will be explained in the following paragraph.)

3

What is a public domain? Streets and market squares that measure
sixteen amos by sixteen amos are considered public domains, for this
was the width of the road in the camp of the Levites in the desert. And
highways by which people travel from city to city that are sixteen amos





wide are [also] public domain. Anything in a public domain that is less
than three tefachim above the ground, even thorns or dung on which
most people do not step, is nevertheless insignificant when compared to
the ground, and is considered part of a public domain. Likewise, a
ditch in a public domain; that is less than three tefachim deep, is
considered public domain. The holes in the walls facing a public
domain that do not run through to a private domain, and are lower
than three tefachim from the ground, are insignificant compared to the
public domain, and are considered public domain. However, if they are
higher than three tefachim [from the ground], we must consider them
according to their dimensions. If the hole measures four by four
tefachim but is lower than ten tefachim, it is considered a karmelis; if it
is higher than ten tefachim, it is a private domain. If it is less than four
by four tefachim it is a makom petur, whether it is above ten tefachim or
below ten tefachim [from the ground]. Alleys that lead into a public
domain are sometimes regarded as public domain and sometimes as
karmelis. This involves many intricate halachic details. Some authorities
say, that any place through which fewer than 600, 000 people pass
daily, as was the number of Jews in the desert, is not a public domain,
but is regarded as a karmelis. Therefore, nowadays, we have no public
domain. Every God-fearing person should follow the more stringent
view.
4

What is a karmelis? It is any place that is not a public thoroughfare, and
is not properly surrounded by partitions such as a field; or a stream that
is no less than ten tefachim deep and no less than four tefachim wide;
and alleys that have three partitions. Also an itztavanis, (which is a
place in front of shops where merchants sit) or an itztaba, (a stand on
which merchandise is placed,) in front of the pillars in the public





domain, and [the itztaba] is four tefachim wide and from three tefachim
to ten tefachim high. Also a place that measures four [tefachim] square,
and is surrounded by partitions that are less than ten [tefachim] high;
and a mound that measures four [tefachim] square and from three to
ten [tefachim] high; and a pit that measures four [tefachim] square and
is from three to ten [tefachim] deep. There are also many other
examples of karmelis. (The word karmelis is a composite of rach and
mol, which means, neither wet nor dry, but in between. The same
applies in this case; it is neither a private domain, because it does not
have proper walls, nor is it public domain, because not many walk
there.)
5

What is a mekom petur? It is any place in a public domain that does not
measure four [tefachim] square and is more than three [tefachim] high;
or a pit that is not four [tefachim] square and is deeper than three
[tefachim] ; and a place that does not measure four [tefachim] square
but is surrounded by partitions of three or more [tefachim] high. All
these places [are exempt] only when they are in a public domain, [for
then] they are considered a mekom petur. But when they are in a
karmelis, they are also considered part of karmelis.
"
"1

It is forbidden to move anything a distance of four amos in a public
domain or in a karmelis whether by carrying, throwing it, or handing it
over. Even carrying [an object] a little at a time a distance of less than
four amos is also forbidden.




2


It is forbidden to carry, to throw, or to hand over anything from a
private to a public domain or to a karmelis; or [to carry] from a public
domain or from a karmelis to a private domain. It is likewise [forbidden
to carry] from a public domain to a karmelis, or from a karmelis to a
public domain. But regarding a mekom petur, you are permitted to carry
out and bring in from it into a private domain, public domain, or a
karmelis ; and from the latter into the former, provided you do not
carry the article four amos within the public domain or the karmelis.
Since there are many complex differentiations regarding what
constitutes a public domain, a karmelis, and a private domain, (aside
from those mentioned in the previous chapter) ; therefore, in a town
where no eiruv has been erected, a person who is not well versed [in
these laws] should be careful not to carry any article from the place
where it rests into a domain of a different category, unless he is certain
that it is permissible.

3

Taking an article from the place where it is resting is called akirah
(dislodging). Putting down an article is called hanachah (depositing).
Even dislodging without depositing, or depositing without dislodging is
forbidden. Therefore, a Jew is forbidden to hand an article to a non-Jew
in order that he take it from a private domain to a public domain or a
karmelis, for the Jew is thereby doing the dislodging; —rather, the nonJew himself should take the article. Likewise, when a non-Jew brings an
article, the Jew may not take it from his hand, for thereby the Jew does
the depositing; rather, the non-Jew himself should put down the article.
You should be careful in this regard in the case of an infant, when a
non-Jewess carries him to the synagogue to be circumcised, that she
herself pick up the baby in the house, and when she comes to the





courtyard or the lobby of the synagogue, she should put him down, and
then a Jewess should take him.
4

If there is a break in the partition of a courtyard, if what is left of the
partition on one side of [the break] measures four tefachim wide by ten
tefachim high, above the ground, or if there remains on both sides of
[the break in] the wall a piece measuring one tefach wide by ten
tefachim high, and the break is not wider than ten amos, it does not
need to be repaired, for that break is considered as a door. But if the
break is wider than ten amos, or if there has not been left of one side of
the wall the width of four tefachim, or of the two sides, the width of
one tefach of each, and certainly, if it was completely broken, that is, if
there is no wall left, on one side, like this

, then, even if the break

measures only three tefachim, it is forbidden to carry in this courtyard
until it is repaired. (And the best way to repair it is) by making it in the
form of a doorway. (If there are in this courtyard two or more
households, they must also establish eiruvei chatzeiros, as will be
explained, God willing, in Chapter 94).
5

We have stated above that if a break in the partition [of a courtyard] is
not more than ten amos wide, it is considered as a door and does not
need to be repaired. [This rule applies] only if there is only one break,
but if there are two or more breaks, it is necessary that the area of the
remaining wall be at least as large as the broken area. But if the broken
area measures more than the part that remains standing, then every
break that is more than three tefachim wide must be repaired.

6

What is a tzuras hapesach? [If ] you erect two posts on either side [of an
open space], each post no less than ten tefachim high and you place a





stick or a string on them, [it is a tzuras hapesach, a form of a doorway.]
It is necessary that the stick or the string be attached specifically to the
top [of the posts] and not to their sides. However, if you hammer a nail
into the top of the posts and tie the string around it, it is perfectly
acceptable. It is essential that neither of the posts be away from the wall
more than three tefachim, nor should they be higher than three tefachim
from the ground. In an emergency, when it is impossible to make a
tzuras hapesach, except by placing the posts at a [greater] distance from
the walls than three tefachim, you may follow the lenient view.
7

If a courtyard or a house opens to the street and its door opens inward
and the doorpost, the lintel, and the threshold are towards the street,
the space [in front of the door] is sometimes considered a private
domain and sometimes a karmelis. Since not everyone is well versed in
these laws, therefore, because of the existing doubt, we apply both the
restrictions of a private domain and those of a karmelis. It is forbidden
to carry anything from there into the street which is either a public
domain or a karmelis, or from the street into this place for it may be a
private domain. It is likewise forbidden to carry anything from the
house or the courtyard to such a place, [in the space in front of the
door,] nor from that place to any of the others, for it may be considered
a karmelis. Therefore, if the door is locked and needs to be opened, care
should be taken that a non-Jew put the key into the lock, and after
opening the lock, before the Jew opens the door, the non-Jew should
remove the key; for if the Jew would open the door while the key is in
the lock he is thereby bringing the key from a karmelis into a private
domain.




8


In many places there are houses whose roof extends from the wall of the
house into the street and it is supported there by pillars. It is forbidden
to carry anything from such a house into the area [beneath the
extension], or to bring in anything from there into the house. It is also
forbidden to carry anything there [over a distance of ] four amos,
because halachically it is considered as a street, whether it is a public
domain or a karmelis. And although the roof rests on the pillars, giving
it the form of a door [tzuras hapesach] which the halachah regards as a
wall, still, since on its sides [between the pillars and the house] there is
no wall, [you may not carry there]. It is necessary, therefore, to erect a
post on one side near the wall of the house opposite the pillar which
supports the roof, so that there should be a tzuras hapesach also on that
side. The same should be done on the other side. If there are a number
of such houses adjacent to each other, in this manner, it is sufficient if
you erect [these posts] on the end of the outermost house on one side
[of the row], and on the end of the outermost house on the other side
[of the row]; and [the residents] should make an eiruvei chatzeiros.

9

You are allowed to place food in front of a non-Jew in a yard or a
house, even though you know that he will take it outside; as long as you
do not put [the food] into his hand, for if you do, you are doing an
akirah dislodging; and you may place the food in front of him only if
the non-Jew is allowed to eat [the food] there if he wants to, but if he is
not allowed to eat it there, or you are giving him a large amount of
food, so that he could not eat it all there; or if you give him other
articles, when it is obvious that he will carry them outside, it is
forbidden, because it appears as though you gave it to him with the aim
of carrying it outside.




10


A woman may lead her child even in a public domain as long as she
does not drag him. But the child should lift up one foot and keep the
other one on the ground supporting himself on it until he sets down
the foot he had lifted. This way he is always supporting himself on one
foot. But when she drags both feet [of the child] it is just like carrying
him, which is forbidden, even in a karmelis. Carrying a child outright,
even if he is big enough to walk by himself, is forbidden, even in a
karmelis. The Sages applied the rule that ""a living being carries itself""
only to exempt [the person who carries it] from bringing a sin-offering,
but it still is a violation of a Rabbinical prohibition (shevus). In a
karmelis it is a shevus on a shevus. It is necessary to warn the public who
[generally] err regarding this matter.

11

[From] a stream that runs through a courtyard it is forbidden to draw
water.

12

A person must not stand in a private domain and urinate or spit into a
public domain or a karmelis, or from a public domain or a karmelis into
a private domain, or from a public domain into a karmelis or from a
karmelis into a public domain. Likewise, you must not walk four amos
in a public domain or a karmelis, or from one domain into another
with saliva in your mouth, if the saliva has already been moved from
one place in your mouth to another.

13

You may spill dirty water into a courtyard that measures four amos
square, although it will run off to a public domain.

1


Fencing an area with partitions to make carrying in it permissible, will
serve that purpose only when the area was fenced around for dwelling
purposes. What is meant by ""fenced around for dwelling purposes"" ? If
you built a house to live in, or you opened a door from your house, and
fenced the area with partitions, the way courtyards are built for houses,
then, even if the [enclosed area] is very large, it is an absolute private
domain. But areas that have been fenced around for other than
dwelling purposes, such as gardens or orchards, whose fences are made
only to guard their contents, these are graded by their size. If the area
would not require more than two seahs [of seed], you may carry things
in it, but if it would require more than two seahs [of seed], it is
considered a karmelis.

2

What is the size of an area requiring two seahs [of seed] ? It is the area of
the courtyard of the Tabernacle, [which was] one hundred amos long by
fifty amos wide. If the space is a square, it would measure seventy amos
and four tefachim by seventy amos and four tefachim. (In our amos it
measures fifty three by fifty three and a little more). If the area is
circular or in any other shape, it should also be calculated to measure 5,
000 square amos. (In our amos it is 3, 750.) However, if the length of
the area is more than twice its width even if only by one amah, then it
is considered as requiring more than two seahs [of seed], since it does
not resemble the courtyard of the Tabernacle.

3

A space which has been fenced around for other than dwelling
purposes, and which is not larger than ""two seahs"" so that you are
allowed to carry in it, if there is a courtyard next to it, you are also
permitted to carry from there into the courtyard and from the





courtyard into the enclosed space, because [the enclosure] and the court
are considered as one domain. However, it is not considered the same
domain as the house, and therefore the vessels in such an enclosed space
are forbidden to be carried into the house, and vessels that are in the
house are forbidden to be carried into the enclosed space.
4

If you fenced around a space with partions for other than dwelling
purposes, and afterwards built a dwelling on it, or you made a door in
the house leading to it; what can legally be done to change it into an
enclosure for dwelling purposes? You should make a break in the
partition of more than ten amos; because an opening of ten amos is
considered a door; but if it is more than that, it is considered a break,
whereby the partitions will be nullified. After that if you repair the
fence, it will be considered as fenced around for dwelling purposes.

5

[If you have] a courtyard that is larger than two seahs, and you planted
trees in it, even in the greater part of it, the status of dwelling is thereby
not nullified, and it is still considered as fenced around for dwelling
purposes, because people usually spend time in the shade of trees.
However, if you planted seeds that cover the greater part of the yard
(even if it is not in one area, but scattered) the status of dwellings has
been nullified and the entire [yard] is considered as a garden. If [the
planted area] covers less than half of the courtyard; and this area is less
than two seahs, it is of no consequence compared to the courtyard and
the whole area is regarded as a courtyard. But if [the planted area]
covers more than two seahs (in one place), then the planted area is
regarded as a karmelis, and the rest of the courtyard is completely open
to a place which is forbidden (to carry into), and thus it is forbidden to
carry anything in it except within four amos.




6


Likewise, a courtyard measuring only two seahs or less, part of which
has been planted, should also be judged by the greater part of it. If the
greater part has been planted, although you are permitted to carry
there, since it is not larger than two seahs, nevertheless, vessels that are
in your house are forbidden to be carried into it. Therefore, it is
necessary to make a partition in front of the garden in order that you
may carry things from the house into the courtyard.

It is forbidden to walk out into a public domain or a karmelis with
article that is neither a garment nor an ornament. Therefore, you may
not go out with a needle stuck in your garment, or even a pin without
an eye. Even when he needs it for his clothes a man should follow the
stringent view. However, since women usually fasten their ribbons,
kerchiefs and similar things with pins, she is permitted to go out with
[pins] for her dressing needs, but only with a pin without an eye, not
with a needle with an eye.

2

There are certain ornaments that our Sages of blessed memory forbid to
be carried on Shabbos in a public domain. Some ornaments are
forbidden to men and some ornaments are forbidden to women. For
example, jewelry about which there is reason to be concerned that the
woman might remove in order to show it to someone [is not
permitted.] Now, the prevailing custom is to permit it, and the
authorities wrote reasons for this, but a God-fearing person should be
strict regarding this. A man should be careful not to go out with a ring
on which there is no engraved seal, and he should certainly not wear a





watch, even if it is attached to a gold chain that he wears around his
neck, which is a piece of jewelry. But the pocket watch [is certainly
considered] a burden, and is not permitted.
3

A silver key, even though it is made for ordinary use, since it is also a
piece of jewelry, it is customary to carry it on Shabbos. But eyeglasses,
even if they have silver frames, are forbidden to be carried outside.

4

A woman may not put a garment over her kerchief, nor should a man
put a garment on his hat to protect it from the rain, for this is not the
usual way the garment is worn. If their intention is that they should not
be annoyed by the rain; it is permitted.

5

A person who is lame, or a sick person, just recovering from his illness,
or a very old person, who finds it impossible to walk without a cane, is
permitted to walk with a cane in his hand. But if he can walk without a
cane, and he walks without one in his house, except that when he walks
outside he uses it for support, he is forbidden to do so. A blind person
is forbidden to go out with a cane in a city in which there is no eiruv. A
person who needs no cane at all is forbidden to go out with one even in
a town where there is an eiruv, because it shows disregard of the
Shabbos.

6

A person who is shackled in chains may walk out with them, [on
Shabbos].

7

You may not walk out on stilts, that people use in mud and water.

8

You may go out with a plaster on a wound (provided you do not place
it on the wound on Shabbos) for since it is a remedy it is like an





ornament. And you may wrap it in an inexpensive piece of cloth and it
becomes insignificant in relation to the plaster. But an article of value,
such as a scarf or the like, you must not wrap around it, because it does
not become insignificant in relation to the plaster, neither is this the
usual way a scarf is worn. It is therefore considered a burden.
9

You may go out with cotton placed in your ear to absorb discharge
from the ear, provided it is tightly stuck, so that it cannot fall out.
Likewise, you may walk out with a footpad or straw in your shoes, if it
was placed there in a way that it cannot fall out.

10

A woman should not go out with a menstrual pad that she uses in order
not to soil her clothing; neither may she go out with an apron which
she wears for the same purpose, unless it is a real garment. But if she
puts on the pad or the apron to save herself from discomfort, for if the
blood dries on her skin she will suffer discomfort, she is permitted to go
out with them.

11

When walking in a place of mud and clay, you may raise your clothes a
little so that they will not be soiled but it is forbidden to raise them
fully.

12

It is permitted go out on Shabbos wearing two garments one over the
other, even though you do not need the other garment for yourself but
are taking it out for someone else. But this is true only if occasionally
on weekdays you also wear two such garments, for then it is your usual
way of dressing, (even though most of the time you do not dress like
that). But if you never wear two such garments, you are forbidden to go
out with them on Shabbos, because the second one is considered a





burden. The same law applies to two pairs of socks, or a large hat over a
yarmulka or something similar.
13

If it is the custom of the community to wear a cheap belt underneath
and an expensive one it is permitted to do so on Shabbos, even though
now you need only one, and the second one is taken out for a friend.
But if it is not the custom to wear two belts, even though you prefer
personally, to dress like this, you are forbidden to do so; for since one
belt is sufficient, the second one is considered a burden. In any case,
you are permitted to go out with two belts where there is a garment
worn between them, as for example, when the bottom belt is on your
trousers and the top one on your coat, for then you have benefit and
use of both.

14

[Regarding] a handkerchief, it is customary to wrap it under the outer
garment around the trousers. You should be careful not to tie it into a
double knot, one above the other. A God-fearing man who usually
wears suspenders to hold up his trousers, should remove them on
Shabbos, so that the handkerchief is actually used [to hold up his
trousers]. Some people are accustomed to wrap the handker-chief
around their neck. This is not permitted, unless you wear no other
kerchief around your neck, and you are accustomed to wearing a scarf
in cold weather. You must tie it in a way that is permissible; but just
throwing it around your neck, letting the corners hang down in front of
you, is absolutely forbidden. Likewise, it is forbidden to wrap it around
your leg or your hand and to walk out with it.

15

Some authorities permit wearing gloves [on Shabbos], while others
forbid it. [Regarding a muff ] that warms both hands together, you may





be more lenient.
16

You may go out with a tallis with tzitzis if you wear it in the usual way;
but if you wear it folded around your neck in a community where it is
not customary to wear it like that, it is forbidden.

17

If a garment has two straps or strings with which it is tied, or if it has
hooks with which it is fastened, and one of them was torn off, even
though the remaining one that matches it is useless, nevertheless, if you
intend to repair it later by replacing its mate, the remaining one does
not become insignificant to the garment. It is like a burden, and it is
forbidden to go out in such a garment. But if you do not intend to
repair it, therefore, since the remaining piece is useless, it is thus
insignificant to the garment, and you are permitted to go out with it. If
it is an article of value, such as a silk cord or a silver clasp, even if you
do not intend to repair it, it is not insignificant to the garment and it is
forbidden to go out with it.

18

Bald persons who wear a toupé on their head may go out in it on
Shabbos to a public domain, because it is considered as their ornament,
(provided it was prepared on erev Shabbos).

19

One who wears an amulet must consult a halachic authority as to
whether or not he may go out with it on Shabbos, because not all
amulets are of equal value. A woman who wears a stone called
sternschuss to prevent miscarriage may go out with it on Shabbos.

If, Heaven forbid, a fire breaks out on Shabbos, our Sages were
concerned that the head of the household and his family [who are] in
the vicinity of the fire, will be occupied with rescuing their belongings.
They will be hasty and panicky at the prospect of losing their valuables,
and, as a result, forget that it is Shabbos, and they might extinguish the
fire. They, therefore, forbade rescuing even objects that are [normally]
permitted to be handled. They forbid even to move them to a place
where it is permitted to carry. Only that which is needed for the day is
permitted to be rescued. For instance: If a fire broke out on Shabbos
eve before the [Shabbos] meal, you may rescue [enough] food for three
meals, [food] fit for humans—for humans, [food] fit for animals—for
animals. [If the fire broke out] in the morning, [you may rescue] food
for two meals. [If the fire broke out] in the afternoon, [you may rescue]
food for one meal. If one vessel contains much food [i.e. more than you
need], for example, a basket full of breads, or a barrel full of wine or
something similar; since you can remove it [all] at the same time, it is
permissible [although you are rescuing more than you need]. Similarly,
if you spread a sheet or something similar, and gather into it everything
you can remove, even quantities of food and drink, and you remove
them all at once, it is permissible. You may also remove all the utensils
that you need to use on that day [Shabbos].

2

You may say to others: ""Come and rescue [something] for yourselves,""
and each person may rescue the food that he needs, or a vessel that
contains even a great amount [of food] and it will belong to the rescuer,
since the owner renounced his ownership, and he [the rescuer] acquired
it from ownerless property. If he [the rescuer] is a God-fearing person
and returns to the owner that which he rescued because he knows [that





the owner] did not willingly renounce ownership, he may receive
payment for the rescue and it is not considered Shabbos wages, since,
legally, it is all his. Nevertheless, it is virtuous not to accept payment for
the trouble of rescuing [anything] on Shabbos, although it is not
[considered] Shabbos wages, because a virtuous person should give up
his rights concerning anything that has the slightest taint of sin.
3

All that was said above applies only [when taken] to a place to which it
is permitted to carry things. But, to a place where it is forbidden to
carry, it is forbidden to rescue anything. However, clothes that you can
wear may be put on, and you may wrap everything you can around you
and carry them out even to a public domain. Then, you may remove
the clothing, [return] and again put on clothes and carry them out.
[You may do this] even the entire day. You may also tell others: ""Come
and rescue!"" and they, too, may rescue.

4

Since the owners of the houses that are near the fire are less panicky
even though they are afraid that [the fire] will also reach them, they
may rescue everything [by taking it] to a place where it is permitted to
carry. Some say that money as well as other valuables, though they are
muktzeh, may be rescued from a great, sudden loss, such as a fire, a
flood or a robbery, by placing on them some food item, and handling
them together in that manner. (However, under other circumstances,
there is no allowance whatsoever to handle muktzeh in this manner.)
There are those even more lenient [who rule] that the valuables
themselves may be handled, because where a great sudden loss [is
involved] the prohibition of muktzeh is set aside provided that you do
not carry them out to a place wherein it is forbidden to carry.




5


All sacred books, whether they be handwritten or printed, may be
rescued from a fire, a flood, and the like, even to a yard or an alleyway
to which it is forbidden to carry due to the lack of an eiruv; provided
the yard or alley is constructed in a manner that an eiruvei chatzeiros or
shitufei mevo'os could be set up. It is permitted to use a non-Jew to
rescue these books even [if it means] carrying through a public domain.
(Salvaging the dead from fire is discussed further on in Chapter 88,
paragraph 16.)

6

You may rescue the book-bag along with the [sacred] book, and the
tefillin-bag along with the tefillin.

7

A Seifer Torah should be rescued before other books.

8

When life is endangered you may extinguish the fire. Therefore, in areas
that Jews reside amongst non-Jews, you may extinguish the fire even if
it is in a non-Jew's house. It all depends on the circumstances. Only
extinguishing is permitted, but it is prohibited to desecrate the Shabbos
to save some valuables. If you violated the law and did desecrate [the
Shabbos], you should consult a rabbi to learn the way of repentance.
"
"1

It is forbidden to wash your entire body, or even most of your body
with hot water, even if it was heated on Friday. Even to wash one limb
at a time, is forbidden when the majority of the body [will be washed].
Even to enter a bathhouse solely for the purpose of sweating is also
forbidden. But you may wash your face, hands and feet with hot water
that was heated on Friday.




2


Water that flows hot from its source such as the hot springs of Tiberias
and the like, if [the waters] are in the ground and there is no roof over
them, you may wash even your entire body in them. But, if [the water]
is in a vessel or the place is covered with a roof, it is forbidden. Even to
enter a bathhouse solely for the purpose of sweating, is forbidden.
There are those who say that as long as [the water] is in the ground
even if the place has a roof, you may bathe in it.

3

You may immerse your entire body in cold water. However, you may
not stand afterwards in front of an oven in order to warm yourself,
because that amounts to washing in hot water. Even if you washed only
your hands in cold water, do not warm them near the oven while they
are still wet, because it is considered as if you washed with water that
was warmed today [Shabbos], for such water is prohibited for washing
even one limb. You must first dry them well and as stated in Chapter
80, paragraph 32, you must rub them well before drying them so that
only a little water remains on them.

4

If you bathe, be careful not to squeeze your hair. Also take care not to
swim because it is prohibited to swim on Shabbos and Yom Tov. It is
also forbidden to make things float, such as wood chips, on top of the
water. If you bathe in a place where it is forbidden to carry, you must
also take care before leaving [the water], to first remove the water from
your body and hair, and dry yourself well, so that no water remains on
you, which you would be carrying from one domain into another.
Similarly, in the river itself, you must take care not to carry the water
which is on you four amos, because the river is considered a karmelis.
Since not everyone knows to be careful, therefore, it has become the





prevailing custom in these regions not to bathe at all on Shabbos even
in cold water, except for the purpose of a mitzvah, such as a woman
after menstruation, (as discussed further, Chapter 162, paragraph 7) or
a man after a nocturnal emission.
5

You may stand at the river bank and wash your hands in the river; and
it is not forbidden to remove the water on your hands from the river
onto the bank, because the river is [considered] a karmelis and the bank
is also a karmelis, and it is permitted to carry from one karmelis to
another less than four amos, provided that you take care to dry your
hands thoroughly before walking four amos.

6

You may clean your hands by rubbing them with crushed grain [or
bran] although your hands may be wet, provided you don't put the
water directly on the crushed grain. But it is forbidden to rub your wet
hands with salt, and, certainly, not with soap because it liquefies.

7

Water that is not usually used for washing, but, rather, for medicinal
purposes, such as malodorous or noxious [water], is forbidden to be
used for washing on Shabbos, since it is obvious that it is being used as
a cure, (see below, Chapter 91). This applies only if you linger in [the
water], but, if you do not linger, it is permissible, because [then] it
appears [that your purpose is] only to cool off. Concerning the hot
springs of Tiberias and the like: if the normal practice is to bathe in
them only for health reasons, it is forbidden to bathe in them on
Shabbos for health reasons, even if you do not linger in them.

It is written [in the Torah]: ""…so that your ox and donkey may rest…""
Here the Torah commands us that the animals of a Jew must also rest
[on Shabbos]; and not only cattle, but all animals. Therefore, it is
forbidden to allow your animal to carry out a load, because even if the
animal went out on its own, into the public domain carrying a burden,
you have violated a positive command of the Torah. Even if the object
[the animal is carrying] is ornamental, nevertheless, it is [considered] a
burden. However, if the purpose of the object is to heal [the animal],
such as a bandage on a wound, the animal may go out with it.
Similarly, anything the animal requires for its safekeeping, is considered
like a garment for a human being and the animal may go out with it.
But something which is for excessive safeguarding is forbidden.
Similarly, an object that this [particular] animal cannot be safeguarded
with, though another animal can be safeguarded with it, is considered a
burden for this animal and is forbidden.

2

A horse may walk out with a halter or a bridle but not with both. You
may wrap the halter straps around its neck and it may go out with it,
provided it is wrapped loosely so that you may easily insert your hand
between the wrapped [straps] and its neck, to restrain it, should it
attempt to run off. You may handle the halter and place it on the
animal but you may not lean on it because it is forbidden to lean on
any animal on Shabbos. However, a donkey may not walk out with an
iron bridle because that is an excessive safeguard for a donkey. An ox or
a cow which do not require safeguarding, are forbidden to be taken out
with a rope around its neck, unless they have a habit of running away.
A rope tied on the horse's mouth is considered a burden because it is





not safeguarded by it, since it slips off its mouth. This is not
comparable to a halter which is tied to its head.
3

Horses, as well as other animals, must not go out wearing a packsaddle. Only a donkey may go out with a pack-saddle to protect it from
cold, because by nature it easily catches cold. If you tied the saddle on
the donkey before Shabbos, it may go out with it on Shabbos, because
it is [considered] its garment. If, however, it is not tied on, it may not
go out with it, because it may fall off and you may carry it by hand.
You may not tie the saddle on Shabbos because it requires coming close
[to the animal] and leaning on it. However, when the donkey is in the
yard it is permitted to place a pack-saddle on it to protect it from the
cold, provided it is not let out. However, you may never place a packsaddle on a horse unless there is extreme cold which may harm the
horse. Likewise, during the summer when there are many flies which
annoy it, you may place a pack-saddle on it, provided you take care not
to lean on the animal while putting it on. Removing a pack-saddle on
Shabbos, whether from a donkey or a horse, is forbidden, since it
suffers no discomfort if it is not removed.

4

It [the animal] may not go out [wearing] a bell even if it is plugged and
does not ring. Even in a city where an eiruv has been established, it is
forbidden to let it go out with a bell. Only in the yard may it [the bell]
be upon her. If it [the bell] is not plugged, and rings [as the animal
moves], [then,] even in the yard it is forbidden to be on the animal.

5

You may lead a horse with the straps of the bridle, provided you hold
the end of the straps so that a tefach does not protrude from your hand;
also, so that the strap which is between your hand and the animal [does





not reach] to within a tefach of the ground. If the strap is very long
then, wrap it around the horse's neck.
6

When two or more animals are tied together and by holding one rein
all are led, one following the other, it is forbidden to do this on
Shabbos, even in a city where an eiruv has been established. But, you
may hold a number of reins in your hand to lead them [the animals], if
you do it the way it was explained in the previous paragraph.

7

Hens may not go out with strings that are tied to them for
identification purposes, or to keep them from breaking things. But, to
tie their feet so that they cannot run away [is permitted]. Similarly
when horses graze in the field, their forelegs are tied together, so that
they cannot run away; this too is permitted, provided that you not
fetter or hog-tie them. ""Fettering"" means tying the foreleg to the hind
leg. ""Hog-tying"" means tying one of the hind legs upwards, so that [the
animal] walks only on three legs, which is forbidden even on weekdays
because it is forbidden to cause pain to animals.

8

If you have a non-Jewish servant who rides on the animal on Shabbos
when he leads it to water, you need not deter him, because the
prohibition against riding an animal on Shabbos is not due to the
burden that it carries, because a living thing carries itself (and is
forbidden only by a Rabbinic prohibition, which does not apply to the
animal). The prohibition applies to the person [i.e. the rider], for a Jew
is forbidden to ride an animal on Shabbos, but a non-Jew is not bound
by it. And even if the non-Jew places a saddle or a blanket upon which
he will ride, [nevertheless,] they are subordinated to the rider. However,
he may not put anything else on the animal.




9


You may tell a non-Jew to milk the cows on Shabbos, to avoid causing
pain to the animals, because the milk causes them pain. [However,] that
milk is forbidden even to be handled on that day. Instead, the non-Jew
should place it in a safe place. Similarly, you may tell a non-Jew to
force-feed the geese once a day to avoid causing pain to living creatures.

10

You may not lend or rent your animal to a non-Jew unless you stipulate
that it be returned before Shabbos. If it happened that he did not
return it, you must renounce your ownership of it before Shabbos even
without letting anyone know, to save yourself from transgressing the
law. But, initially, it is forbidden to lend or rent to him relying on this.

11

A person may not measure out barley to feed his animal, but should
just estimate the amount needed.

12

A bundle of hay that was not tied with a ""permanent knot"" (i.e.
double-knotted), may be untied and placed before an animal. You may
cut up hard pumpkins near an animal, provided they were picked
yesterday [before Shabbos]. If the pumpkins are soft and the animal can
eat them as they are, it is forbidden to cut them up.

13

You may place your animal upon growing grass so that it may eat,
because this does not constitute ""work"" for her; [the fact] that she will
be uprooting grass, on the contrary, is a pleasure for her. However, it is
forbidden to place an animal for grazing, [upon] grass that a non-Jew
cut on Shabbos, which is muktzeh. However if it has nothing else to eat,
then it is permitted [in order] to [avoid] causing pain to animals.
Similarly, if it has nothing to drink, you may tell a non-Jew to bring
water for her, from a well [situated] in a karmelis.




14


You may not hang a bag or vessel on an animal from which it will eat,
since it is only for the animal's comfort, so that it will not have to bend
its neck, and you are forbidden to exert yourself on Shabbos [solely] for
the comfort of the animal. However, since calves and colts have short
necks and it is troublesome for them to eat off the ground, it is
permitted to hang a feedbag on them in the yard. But they may not go
out with it, because it is considered a burden.

15

You may not throw grain for the poultry in a damp place because it is
possible that some will remain there and will sprout afterwards.

16

If you give feed to your animals it is forbidden to first put it into a sieve
to remove the chaff and to cleanse it. But, if this is not your purpose,
you may take it with a sieve and put it into the trough.

17

If you give bran to your animals or your poultry, it is forbidden to put
water into it. If you put water in on Friday it is forbidden to knead it
on Shabbos, but you may pour it from one vessel into another in order
to mix it.

18

Animals [such as cattle,] beasts, and poultry that are raised in the house
and whose feeding is your responsibility, may be fed on Shabbos. But, it
is forbidden to trouble yourself in order to feed those not raised in the
house and whose feeding is not your responsibility. Even [just] to throw
feed before them is forbidden. Therefore, it is forbidden to place food
before doves because they can fly out and get their food in the fields.
You may place food before a dog. Even if it has no owner, there is
somewhat of a mitzvah to give it some food, because the Holy One,
blessed is He, showed it compassion; for, because of the scarcity of its





food, He caused its food to remain undigested in its intestines for three
days. Some are accustomed to place wheat before the birds on Shabbos
Shirah, but this is not proper, because it is not our responsibility to feed
them.
19

You may invite a non-Jew to your house to dine with you on Shabbos.
Although this is prohibited on Yom Tov because of the concern that
you may prepare extra food for him, (as is explained in Chapter 98) ;
however, on Shabbos, this is of no concern and you may even serve him
alone. Although you are not responsible for feeding him, nevertheless,
since we are told to feed the non-Jew in order to maintain good will, it
is considered as if you are responsible to feed him (see above Chapter
82, paragraph 9).

20

Animals, beasts and fowl that are not yet trained to return to their cages
in the evening, or even if they are trained to do so but at the moment,
they have escaped, it is forbidden to drive them [back] into the cages or
into the house. Even if they are in the house or inside the cage, but the
door is open, it is forbidden to close it, because, as a result they are
being caught, which is a violation of the prohibition of ""trapping.""

21

If they are already trained and domesticated and usually return home in
the evening but they went out, and you are worried lest they be stolen,
you are permitted to drive them to a safe place, but you may not carry
them by hand because they are muktzeh.

22

You must not deliver an animal of its offspring on Shabbos. Even to
assist it, that is, holding the newborn so that it should not fall to the
ground, is forbidden.




23


You may apply oil on a fresh wound which is causing the animal pain,
but it is forbidden to apply oil on a wound that is healing and is only
done for the animal's comfort.

24

If it [i.e. the animal] ate [too] much vetch or the like and is [now]
suffering, you may cause it to trot in the yard in order to exhaust it so
that it should recuperate. If it (i.e. the animal) has become hyperemic
[suffering from an increase in the blood], you may make it stand in
water so that it will cool off. If there is a possibility that if it is not bled,
it [may] die, [then] you may tell a non-Jew to bleed it. Other remedies
should also be administered through a non-Jew.
"
"1

The following items are not muktzeh and may be handled on Shabbos:
If you made up your mind, not to eat something on Shabbos because it
is unfit to eat, except in an extreme circumstance, or if it is fit to eat,
even in normal circumstances, but you set it aside for sale, even if you
placed it in storage; also food that is considered dog food today even if
was not intended as such before Shabbos, for instance, an animal or
bird that died on Shabbos; or something that took a new form today
other than what it was yesterday, but is, nevertheless, still fit for some
use today, such as vessels that broke today but are still fit for some
utility that is similar to their original purpose, [i.e.] to hold food or
drink; also bones that were stripped today of their meat and are fit for
dogs. All of these things may be handled on Shabbos, unless you
definitely reject it, such as [drying] dates and raisins.




2


The following are considered muktzeh and may not be handled on
Shabbos: Food that is totally unfit for human consumption as is, even
in extreme circumstances, because it requires cooking, although it is fit
for animals or dogs. Since it is meant to be eaten by people afterwards,
it is not [considered] food for animals and dogs. Similarly, things that
are not fit for any use on Shabbos; such as wood, feathers, animal skins,
wool or flax and all living animals, even if they are domesticated; nut
shells, egg shells, hardened bones that are not fit even for dogs, doors
and windows of a house, ([those] that are forbidden to be hung on
Shabbos); as well as broken vessels that are no longer fit for any use; all
these things and similar things are forbidden to be handled.
Nevertheless, when broken glass vessels can cause injury, the broken
pieces may be removed.

3

Food that is forbidden to be eaten, but from which benefit may be
derived, and is fit for a non-Jew in its present state, such as cooked
meat and the like, and you have the right to give it to a non-Jew since it
is yours, may be handled. But, if it is not fit for a non-Jew in its present
state, such as raw meat, (neither can it be considered as food for dogs,
since it is fit for a non-Jew;) or if you are unable to give it to a non-Jew,
because it is not yours but someone else's, is forbidden to be handled.

4

Nolad is something that came into being today, such as ashes from a fire
which was ignited today by a non-Jew; or an egg that was laid today
and sap running from the trees during the month of Nissan. And even if
nothing new came into being today, but came as a result of an act
which is forbidden today, such as fruit that fell from the tree, or was
plucked by a non-Jew, or milk that was milked today and the like, are





also forbidden to be handled. But bread that a non-Jew baked on
Shabbos, in a town where a majority are non-Jews, where in all
likelihood he baked it for non-Jews, in extreme circumstances, or for
the sake of a mitzvah, a Jew may eat it on Shabbos.
5

Utensils that are specifically [used] to do work that is forbidden on
Shabbos, such as a mortar, a mill, a hammer, an ax, and brooms used
for sweeping the house, a shofar, a candelabra, a needle used for sewing,
whole candles [made] either of tallow or of wax, cotton wicks, a shatnez
garment that is forbidden to wear, and anything similar to these, may
be handled [only] when needed for use; for example, a hammer to crack
walnuts, or an ax to cut food, an unbroken needle to remove a splinter,
(however, if its eye or point is broken off it is forbidden to be handled
at all). Likewise, you may handle them for their space, that is, if you
need to use the space occupied by the object. Once you have lawfully
taken it or if you forgot and took it in your hand, you may continue to
handle it and place it wherever you like. However, if you do not need
the object itself nor the space it occupies, but you want to handle it
solely for itself, that it not be stolen or damaged, such objects are
forbidden to be handled. It is also forbidden to handle tefillin.
However, if they are lying in an indecent place where they might be
soiled, you may handle them and put them in a secure place.

6

All objects that are Muktzeh because of ""monetary loss,"" are forbidden
to be handled. These include things that you set aside not to be used
because of your concern lest they become defective, such as: a
craftsman's tools, a knife used to repair a quill, a knife used for
slaughtering, a knife used for circumcision, as well as writing paper,
promissory notes, accounting ledgers, letters that you take care to





safeguard, valuable vessels that you do not use at all, as well as anything
that you are so careful about that you keep in a special place, and do
not use it, as well as vessels in your store that are intended for sale, even
if they are eating implements, if you do not usually lend them, (but if
you sometimes lend them they are not muktzeh.) All of these and
similar things, as well as a purse in which you keep money, are muktzeh
because of ""monetary loss"" and you are forbidden to handle them even
if you need to use them or you need the space they occupy.
7

An object that cannot be considered a ""vessel"" at all, such as wood,
stones, chunks of metal and the like, are forbidden to be handled in any
way, even when you need to use them or the space they occupy, unless
you set it aside before Shabbos for some permanent use. Therefore, you
may not handle a splinter to pick your teeth. Broken candles, are also
not considered ""vessels"" and you are forbidden to handle them. Also, a
ladder used for an attic is not considered a ""vessel.""

8

Implements for permissible usage, or even those used for both
forbidden and permissible [usage], such as pots or even loathesome
vessels, (because on Shabbos, muktzeh because of ""repugnance"" is
permissible), may be handled even if only for the vessel's sake, that it
not be stolen or broken. However, if there is no need for handling
them, you are forbidden to handle them. Sacred writings and foods
may be handled even for no purpose at all.

9

Just as it is forbidden to handle muktzeh, or something newly formed,
so is it forbidden to place a vessel beneath those objects in order that
they may drop therein; for by doing this, you are making the vessel
useless, because you will no longer be allowed to handle it. This is





considered as if you cemented it there. (See above, Chapter 75,
paragraph 11.) However, you may turn a basket over in front of young
chicks so that they can go on and off it, because once they are no longer
on it, it is permissible to handle the basket. If the chicks were on the
basket at twilight, it is forbidden to handle the basket for the rest of the
day.
10

Earth or sand that is heaped up in the corner of the yard or house, may
be handled, for the fact that you made a pile, indicates its preparation
for use. However, if it is scattered, it is considered part of the ground
and it is forbidden to be handled. Also, if you cut a branch from a tree
before Shabbos to use as a fan, or to chase away flies or any similar
[use], you may use it on Shabbos since you prepared it for that purpose
and made it into a [useful] utensil. But, it is forbidden to take a twig
from a broom on Shabbos, since it is set aside [from use]. Even if a
non-Jew took it out it is forbidden to handle it.

11

Wooden boards belonging to the household that are not for sale, may
be handled. If they belong to a carpenter it is forbidden to handle
them, unless it was his intention on Friday to use them on Shabbos.

12

Every type of muktzeh is forbidden only to be handled, but touching
muktzeh, without moving it, is permitted. Thus, you may touch
standing candlesticks even while the candles are burning in them.
Similarly, you may take an object that may be handled which is lying
on top of muktzeh. However, you may not touch a hanging candelabra,
because just by touching it you will be moving it. You may cover a
muktzeh object with a non-muktzeh object, [to protect it] from rain and
the like.




13


If handled in an unusual manner it is permitted to handle muktzeh.
Therefore, if you unintentionally left a muktzeh object on any vessel, or
it fell there on Shabbos, if you need the permitted vessel, or the space it
occupies, you may shake off [the muktzeh object] or carry the vessel
[with the muktzeh] to another place and shake off the muktzeh there.
This can also be done if you left money in a pocket of your garment
and you need the garment. But, for the sake of the muktzeh object
itself, it is forbidden to do this. (If you intentionally put a muktzeh
object on a vessel before Shabbos, [the vessel] becomes a base for the
forbidden object [and it may not be handled on Shabbos]. (This will,
God willing, be explained in the following chapter.)

14

However, if you don't need the permitted vessel, you are forbidden to
handle it if there is a muktzeh object on it. Therefore, you may not
carry a child even in a private domain, if he has a stone in his hand or
any other muktzeh object. But, if the child is very attached to you, and
would get sick if you do not pick him up, and at the same time it is
impossible to make him throw away the stone or any other muktzeh
object, because he would scream or cry, you may pick him up [and
carry him] if you are in a private domain. If the child has a coin in his
hand, you may not even hold his hand while he is walking, even in a
private domain, even if he is very attached to you, because we are
concerned that the coin may fall from the child's hand, and you may
forget that it is Shabbos and pick it up, resulting in your handling
muktzeh in a direct manner. This is prohibited even where there is
danger of illness, since there is no threat to [the child's] life if you don't
pick him up.




15


It is forbidden to move a corpse on Shabbos. However, you may remove
the pillow from beneath him, so that he does not decompose, provided
you do not move any limb. If the mouth keeps opening, you may tie
the jaw in a way that it opens no further, but not in a way that you
close that which is already open, because then you would be moving a
limb. (See below, end of Chapter 124.)

16

If a fire breaks out and there is concern that the corpse will be burned,
you may move it together with a permitted object, that is, by placing
some food on it or near it and [then] move them together. If there is no
food available you may place on it any vessel or garment which may be
handled. If this, too, is unavailable, you may move it by itself.
Regardless, you may not move it except to a place where carrying is
permitted. But, to a place where you are forbidden to carry, it may not
be moved except by a non-Jew.

17

Anything repulsive such as dung, retch or excrement, whether of
humans or hens, if they are in the house or yard where people live, may
be removed to the trash heap. When a night pot is removed or a
bedpan [to be emptied], as long as the vessel is still in your hand, it may
be returned to its original place. This is in accordance with the law
concerning any muktzeh, that as long as you are holding it you may
handle it in order to place it anywhere you wish. But, once you put it
down you are forbidden to move it, because it is extremely repulsive
(and is worse than ordinary muktzeh due to ""repulsiveness."") However,
if it (the bedpan) is necessary to avoid embarrassment, it may be
replaced. Similarly, if you can put water in it which is fit for an animal
to drink, it may be returned in that way.




18


You may place a vessel under a leak on Shabbos. When it fills, you may
empty it and put it back in its place, provided the dripping [water] is fit
for washing. If, however, the water is dirty, you are forbidden to place a
vessel there, because it is forbidden to create a ""new bedpan."" If you
transgressed and placed [the vessel there] and it is in a place where it is
repugnant to you, you may remove [the water]. (For the laws of
muktzeh involving great monetary loss—see above Chapter 85,
paragraph 4. The laws of muktzeh on Yom Tov and the laws of muktzeh
due to a mitzvah, will be explained, God willing, in their respective
places.)
"
"1

If you intentionally placed a muktzeh object upon your vessel on Friday
and you intended that it be there at the onset of Shabbos, the vessel is
considered a base for a prohibited object [muktzeh]. Even if the
muktzeh object was removed on Shabbos; nevertheless, since it lay there
at twilight, and the vessel then became a base for a prohibited object, it
is forbidden to be handled afterwards for the rest of the Shabbos day
even if you need the object itself or the space it occupies.

2

If at the onset of Shabbos, a permitted object was lying there too,
making the vessel a base for both a prohibited object and a permitted
object, if the permitted object is more important to you, you may
handle it [i.e. the base vessel]. But, if the prohibited object is more
important to you, you are forbidden to handle it. It is, therefore, best to
place the challos on the table before twilight, so that the tablecloth and
the table become a base for [both] the candles and the challos, and it





will be permissible to handle them. If you did not do this, then the
tablecloth and the table become a base solely for a prohibited object
and it is forbidden to handle them. However, having done so, if there is
an important need, such as if a [burning] candle fell on the table and it
must be shaken off, you may rely on the poskim who rule that the rule
of base does not apply unless you intended that the muktzeh object
remain there for the entire Shabbos day, and since it is customary to
have the candlesticks removed in the morning by a non-Jew, it does not
become a base.
3

If you had money in your pocket you may handle the garment, because
the entire garment is not a base, only the pocket, and the pocket is
subordinate to the garment. However, you may not wear it even in the
house, lest you inadvertently go out into the public domain. However,
if a table drawer contains money, it is forbidden to move the table,
because the drawer is a vessel unto itself and not subordinate to the
table.

4

Nothing becomes a base unless the muktzeh object is lying there at
twilight. However, if it was not there at twilight, but was put there
afterward, it does not become a base and the vessel may be handled
even while the muktzeh object is on it. You may, therefore, shake the
table or tablecloth [to remove] bones and peels, provided the table and
tablecloth have not become a base as a result of the candles, as was
discussed above, paragraph 2.

5

[The vessel] does not become a base unless you intentionally placed
[the muktzeh] to remain there at twilight. But, if it was left there as a





result of forgetfulness or if it fell there on its own, [the vessel] does not
become a base.
6

It does not become a base unless the vessel belongs to you. But, if you
placed a muktzeh object on a vessel belonging to someone else, it does
not become a base, because you cannot cause someone else's object [to
become forbidden] without his consent.
"
"1

Some things are forbidden [to do] on Shabbos, although they are [in no
way] similar to a melachah, nor [is there a chance] that they will cause a
melachah. Then, why were they forbidden? Because it is said ""If you
will refrain from walking on Shabbos [or from] doing your needs on
My holy day,"" and [the verse goes on to] say: ""and you will honor it
[the day] by not doing your own needs [literally: ""your ways""], or from
pursuing your needs, or from speaking anything. From the words: ""And
you will honor it by not doing your own ways,"" our Sages, of blessed
memory, inferred that your walking on Shabbos [should be different]
from the weekdays. Therefore, it is forbidden to run on Shabbos.
However, for the purpose of a mitzvah it is permitted to run. ([This is
inferred] because it states ""your ways""; which implies that your own
ways [or needs] are prohibited, but the needs of Heaven are permitted)
and for them it is your duty to run.

2

And from the expression: ""From pursuing your needs"" our Sages, of
blessed memory, inferred that your own needs are [sometimes]
prohibited, even if no melachah is required. For instance, if you take
stock of your belongings to see what their needs might be for





tomorrow, this, too, is forbidden. Similarly, it is forbidden to stroll in
the city for the purpose of finding a horse, or a ship, or a [transport]
coach, to hire after Shabbos, if it is obvious that you are walking for this
purpose. However, [to walk] for the purpose of guarding your own or
your friends' possessions, is permitted.
3

It is forbidden ""to darken near the techum,"" that is, to walk on Shabbos
to the end of the techum or less, and to remain there until dark, in order
to complete your journey sooner by traveling from there onward. Since
you will travel from there onward at the close of Shabbos, it is obvious
that your main reason for walking there was for this purpose. [This is
forbidden] only when you ""darken"" there in order to go and do
something that cannot, under any circumstance, be done on Shabbos;
for example, to hire workers, or to pluck fruit, or to bring back fruit
that are muktzeh, since there is no way to permit doing these things on
Shabbos. But, you may ""darken on the techum"" in order to bring back
your animal, since, had there been houses until there within seventy
amos of each other, you would have been permitted to bring them back
on Shabbos. Similarly it is permitted to bring back fruit [that was
already] plucked which is not muktzeh, since, had there been partitions
surrounding your entire route, it would have been permitted even on
Shabbos. [This applies to] any similar situation. Similarly, you may
walk within the techum on Shabbos, to a garden, to pluck fruit there
after the close of Shabbos, since it is not obvious that you walked for
this purpose, but, rather, people will say that you went for a stroll, or to
search for a lost animal, and once, having been there, you decided to
remain until nightfall in order to pluck your fruit.




4


From the expression ""From speaking anything"" our Sages, of blessed
memory, inferred that your manner of speaking during Shabbos should
not be the same as during the week. Therefore, it is forbidden to say: ""I
will do a certain thing tomorrow"" or, ""I will buy a particular item
tomorrow. It is forbidden only regarding things that are impossible to
do today in any manner. However, something that had any possibility
of being done today [Shabbos], even if at this moment this possibility
no longer exists, is permitted (as I wrote in paragraph 3). Therefore,
you may say: ""I will go there tomorrow"" provided you do not express
yourself in a way that implies that you will travel by car; also, do not
discuss it excessively. Even excessive idle-talk is forbidden. It is
forbidden to relate anything that causes pain (or sadness) on Shabbos.
It is forbidden to make verbal business calculations on Shabbos,
whether they are calculations for future transactions, or calculations
concerning past transactions which are still relevant [at present].
Therefore it is forbidden to say: ""I have spent such an amount for
workers' salaries on that building,"" and you still owe them a certain
amount of wages for which you must know the calculation. However,
calculations. that have no relevancy, you may calculate, provided you do
not do so excessively, because you may not overindulge in idle talk on
Shabbos.

5

From the expression ""Your needs"" our Sages, of blessed memory,
learned that only the needs of man are forbidden, but [his] spiritual
needs are permitted. Therefore, you may ""darken near the techum"" in
order to fulfill a mitzvah. Similarly, you may oversee communal affairs
on Shabbos—for instance, to visit the authorities or ministries, to
intercede for the people, because communal needs are equivalent to





spiritual needs. Similarly, you may speak with a teacher regarding your
child, [asking him] if he will accept him as a [Torah] student or even
[to teach him] a trade, which is also a mitzvah, for if he will have no
trade with which to support himself he will [ultimately] resort to
robbery. But it is forbidden to actually hire a teacher on Shabbos,
because hiring is an unqualified prohibition d'rabanan and is not
permitted even for the sake of a mitzvah. Only that which is forbidden
based on [the verse] ""mimtzo cheftzecha vedabeir davar"" is permitted for
the sake of a mitzvah. It is permitted to announce [the finding] of a lost
object because returning a lost object is a mitzvah.
6

From the expression ""And speaking words"" our Sages, of blessed
memory, learned that only speaking [of prohibited subjects] is forbidden
but thinking [about them] is permitted. Therefore, thinking about
business affairs is permitted. Nevertheless, for the sake of the mitzvah of
Oneg Shabbos it is a mitzvah not to think about business at all, and you
should view it as if all your work has been completed. And this is [the
intent of what is] written: ""Six days will you labor and do all your
work."" But man cannot complete all his work in the course of one
week! Thus, [we deduce] that man should consider every Shabbos as if
his work is concluded. You cannot experience a greater pleasure.
Certainly, you should not think about anything that causes you concern
or anxiety.

7

You may say to a worker: ""Do you think you can join me this evening?""
though he thereby understands that you intend to hire him for work
that evening, because only a direct proposal is forbidden. However, you
may not say to him: ""Be prepared this evening,"" because that is
comparable to saying explicitly that you wish to hire him.




8


If you hire a worker to safeguard something for you, the worker is
forbidden to receive wages specifically for Shabbos. But, if he was hired
by the week or month, he may include his Shabbos wages with his
weekday wages.

9

It is forbidden to give your friend a gift unless he has a need for it on
Shabbos. Similarly, it is forbidden to give collateral to your friend,
unless it is required to fulfill a mitzvah or for Shabbos purposes.
[However,] do not say: ""Here is your collateral,"" but simply give it to
him without comment.

10

Common documents such as promissory notes, bills, or letters of
greeting are forbidden to be glanced at even without articulating [their
contents]. Though you only think of their contents it is nevertheless
forbidden, for the Sages permitted thinking of business, etc. only when
it is not obvious that you are thinking of forbidden subjects. But, in
this case, where it is obvious to all that you are thinking of prohibited
subjects, it is in the category of the prohibition ""mimtzo cheftzecho."" If
you receive a letter and do not know what is written in it, you are
permitted to look at it because it may contain something of vital
personal need. But, the letter should not be read aloud. If you know
that the letter relates only to business matters, it is forbidden even to
look at it. It is also forbidden to handle it because it is muktzeh.

11

If a wall or tablet contains drawings or portraits which are captioned:
""This is a picture of such"" or ""this is a portrait of such,"" it is forbidden
to read this caption on Shabbos. Even to look at it without reading is
forbidden. Similarly, books about wars, and history books dealing with





worldly kingdoms [and governments], as well as mundane parables and
anecdotes such as the Book of Emanuel, and certainly love stories, are
forbidden to be read on Shabbos. Even to look at them, without
uttering words [is forbidden]. Even during the weekdays it is forbidden
because [of the prohibition against joining] frivolous company. [This is
true] even if they are written in Hebrew. Love stories have an additional
prohibition, because they entice the ""yetzer hora."" However, those
history books from which ethical lessons and fear of God [can be
learned], such as the Book of Josephus and the like, even if written in
the vernacular, may be read even on Shabbos. Nevertheless, it is not
proper to read too much of them.
12

It is forbidden to measure anything on Shabbos if there is a need for it,
unless it is essential for the fulfillment of a mitzvah.

13

Where a [substantial] loss is involved, it is permitted to discuss your
business with a Jew or a non-Jew.

14

You may not tell a non-Jew anything that is forbidden for a Jew to do,
because telling a non-Jew is a shvuss. Even to indirectly suggest that he
do it, is forbidden. It is also forbidden to tell him before Shabbos to do
it on Shabbos. Similarly, it is forbidden to tell a non-Jew on Shabbos to
do it after Shabbos. [However,] this is not due to a shvuss, since the
melachah is to be done at a time when it is permitted, but, rather, it is
forbidden because of ""mimtzo cheftzecha"" and is therefore permitted for
the sake of a mitzvah.

15

Even if the non-Jew came on his own to do any melachah for you, you
must protest. Therefore, if a non-Jew wishes to remove the charred tips





from your candles so that they burn better, it is necessary to protest.
16

If you see that you are threatened with a loss; for example, if your wine
barrel has weakened or anything similar, you may send for a non-Jew,
notwithstanding that you know that the non-Jew is certain to repair it,
even by doing an absolute melachah. This is permitted provided that
you are careful not to [even] indirectly suggest any instruction
concerning repairing [the barrel]. However, you may state in his
presence, ""Whoever prevents this loss will not lose his reward."" The
[above method] should not be done unless there is potential for
substantial loss.

17

Anything that is not truly a melachah and is only prohibited as a shvuss,
if it is needed to fulfill a mitzvah, or for someone who is even slightly
ill, you may tell a non-Jew to do it. As a result, it became common
practice to send a non-Jew on Shabbos to bring beer or other Shabbos
needs, even where no eiruv has been established. However, this is
permitted only where there is great necessity [such as when] there is
nothing [else] to drink, but, just for the sake of pleasure this should not
be permitted. It is forbidden to tell a non-Jew to bring [something]
from outside the techum. And even that which he has already brought is
forbidden to be used on Shabbos. Some [poskim] say that this applies
also where you face a loss; [therefore] carrying [in] merchandise that is
being ruined by rain, is permitted through a non-Jew. You may rely on
this opinion where a substantial loss is involved.

18

When it is cold you may tell a non-Jew to light the oven, because
everyone [is considered] ill in regard to cold. However, when it is not
essential, this should not be done. It is also forbidden to permit a non-





Jew to light the oven on Shabbos, during the afternoon, so that it will
be warm at night.
19

It is forbidden to send a non-Jew out of the techum to summon the
relatives of the deceased, or someone to eulogize him.

20

[If ] a non-Jew delivers grain to a Jew as payment of a debt and the Jew
gives him the key to his warehouse, the non-Jew is permitted to
measure and count there, because the non-Jew is occupied with his own
work, since the grain is not considered the Jew's until after the
measuring [is completed]. The Jew is allowed to stand there to be
certain that he is not cheated, provided he does not discuss anything
dealing with their business. However, if they [the non-Jews] delivered
the Jew's own grain, he is forbidden to tell them to unload it from the
wagons into his warehouse. Even should they want to unload it on their
initiative, he must express his disapproval to them.

21

When a non-Jew manufactures cheese from his own milk on Shabbos, a
Jew is permitted to observe the milking and the cheese-making, in
order that it be ""Kosher"" so that he can buy it after Shabbos. Even
though the non-Jew's intention is for the purpose of selling it to the
Jew, [nevertheless,] it is permitted, since the cheese is still the non-Jew's
who makes it for his own benefit. The Jew is even permitted to tell him
to make [the cheese] even on Shabbos, because it is permitted to say to
a non-Jew, ""Do your work,"" even where the Jew benefits from it.

22

A non-Jew who bought goods from a Jew and came on Shabbos to take
delivery, if possible, he should be prevented [from doing so].




23


One whose yahrzeit falls on Shabbos, and he forgot to light a memorial
candle, may ask a non-Jew, at twilight, to light it, but not on Shabbos.
"
"1

One who is slightly ill and makes an effort [and manages] to get around
like a well person, is forbidden to be medically treated in any way, even
in a way that no melachah is involved. [This applies] even to applying
oil, whether this is done by himself or by someone else or even by a
non-Jew.

2

All foods and beverages which are consumed by people who are well
may be eaten and drunk as a cure, even if they have some bad side
effects, and it is [therefore] obvious that it is being done for medicinal
reasons, nevertheless, it is permitted. Anything that is not eaten or
drunk by well people, is forbidden to be eaten or drunk as a cure. You
may consume herbal juices, or drink a raw egg to make your voice more
pleasant. This is not considered medicinal since your throat is not sore.

3

If you have a slight toothache but are not in great pain, do not rinse
them (the teeth) with vinegar, or other liquid for medicinal purposes
and then expectorate the liquid. Rather, you should rinse and swallow
it, or dip some bread into it and eat it as usual. Similarly, if you have a
sore throat do not gargle with some liquid, but, instead, swallow it and,
if as a result, you feel better, then so be it.

4

If you have abdominal pains and the like, or if you have a rash on your
scalp, since in our society we do not usually apply oil except for medical





purposes, it is forbidden to apply oil, because it is obvious that you are
doing this as a cure.
5

One who suffers from angina, and relieves his pain by sucking [milk]
directly from a goat, may do so on Shabbos (because sucking milk is
[considered] mefarek in an unusual manner, and due to the pain of the
illness the Sages did not forbid it.)

6

If you have a stomach ache [and would feel relieved by heat] you may
place on your stomach a cup from which hot water was emptied,
although it still contains warm vapor. Similarly, you may warm up
some clothes and put them on your abdomen.

7

If you have injured your hand or foot, you may soak it in wine to halt
the bleeding, but not in vinegar because it is [more] potent, and is
[therefore] obviously medicinal. For a delicate person, wine is the same
as vinegar and is forbidden. If [the wound] is on the back of the hand
or the back of the foot or was caused by a metal object you may do
anything at all for a remedy. [For the significance of these wounds see
later, Chapter 92, paragraph 5.]

8

For a slight pain of the eyes do not apply undiluted saliva (i.e. saliva
that is in one's mouth before having eaten anything) because it is
obvious that you are doing this as a remedy. However, if you are unable
to open your eyes, you may moisten them with undiluted saliva,
because this is not applied as a remedy but rather to enable you to open
your eyes.

9

If you are suffering from overeating, you may insert your finger into
your throat in order to regurgitate.




10


A wound which is not critical may not be bandaged with a dressing
even if it was prepared the day before. Nor [may you apply] anything
that acts as a remedy, even a leaf or an old dry rag, since it too serves as
a remedy. However, you may apply something to prevent it from being
scratched [or irritated]. If it was already bandaged the day before, you
may open one end [of the dressing] slightly and cleanse the wound
opening, and then open the other end and cleanse it. Do not wipe the
dressing itself because you would be ""smearing."" If the bandage fell off
the wound onto the floor you may not restore it. If it fell on any object,
you may restore it. If you are suffering great pain you may tell a nonJew to restore it. However, you may not ask a non-Jew to prepare a
dressing on Shabbos, because smearing the dressing is a d'oraiso
prohibition and is prohibited even through a non-Jew, unless you take
completely ill (as [is discussed] later, paragraph 16).

11

You may not place a cloth on a bleeding wound because the blood dyes
the cloth; and certainly [not] a red cloth because it is improved by this.
It is also forbidden to squeeze the wound in order to extract blood. But,
what may you do? You may bathe it in water or wine to remove the
blood, and then wrap it in a cloth. If bathing does not stop the
bleeding, you may apply a spider web and then tie a cloth around it.
However, some have misgivings about this because spider webs are
curative. Therefore, if possible, this should be done by a non-Jew.

12

One who punctures an abscess in order to enlarge the opening of the
wound, in the manner of physicians when they attempt to facilitate
healing by enlarging the opening of the wound, is guilty of a Shabbos
violation, for this requires a doctor's skill. If his [purpose in] opening it





the abscess is only to drain the pus, which is causing him pain, and he
is unconcerned if the [opening] closes up again immediately, this is
permitted due to his pain. [This is permitted] only when he punctures
it with a needle or something similar. But, [he may not do so] with his
nails because he then tears some of the skin of the abscess, which makes
him liable [for doing a melachah]. Even by means of a needle or
something similar, there is concern that he may want the wound to
remain open, so that the pus will continue to drain, therefore, wherever
possible this should be done by a non-Jew.
13

If you have an incision on the arm, commonly referred to as ""aftora""
aperture and the opening has closed slightly, you may not insert a
legume [for the purpose] of reopening it, because it is your intention
that it remain open. A dressing (that was prepared yesterday) may be
applied to the incision, because it is only to protect [the wound].
However, if you know that the dressing draws pus or blood, it is
forbidden. Similarly, if you intend to wipe it [and] you know that [as a
result] of wiping, blood or pus will be drawn out it is forbidden to wipe
it. (This is not comparable to puncturing an abscess, because where the
abscess is concerned, the pus and blood have accumulated in one spot
and exist separately, and draining them is not considered making a
wound, whereas in this situation where the pus and blood are still
absorbed throughout the flesh, if you drain them you are [in effect]
making a wound.)

14

If the wound has healed you may apply a dressing that you prepared
yesterday, since it is only for protection. It is permitted to remove the
crust around the wound.




15


If you were stuck by a splinter, you may remove it with a needle,
provided you take care not to extract blood, for that would be making a
wound.

16

A sick person who is confined to bed, but is not critical, or he has an
ailment which causes his entire body to feel pain, whereby, although he
gets around, is considered as someone who is bed-ridden; you may tell a
non-Jew to do [anything required] for his cure, and to cook food for
him. He may, eat on Shabbos that which the non-Jew cooked, since,
today [Shabbos], cooking for him is permitted through a non-Jew.

17

He may also take any medications or do anything necessary for his
cure, whether by himself or through someone else, provided that it does
not involve any forbidden melachah, even if only a d'rabanan
prohibition. But, if it involves even a d'rabanan prohibition, it must be
done only by a non-Jew. If a non-Jew is unavailable, a Jew may do a
d'rabanan prohibition by altering [the usual manner of doing it].

18

When a non-Jewish doctor comes to vaccinate children against
smallpox, if the Jew can offer him compensation to postpone the
vaccination till after Shabbos, he should do so. If not [i.e. the doctor
adamantly refuses] and it must be done on Shabbos, in that case, the
Jew should not hold the child, but let a non-Jew hold him.
"
"1

[The laws of ] Shabbos are suspended where there is a life-threatening
situation, as are all mitzvos in the Torah. Therefore, one who is
dangerously ill and he is an observant person, though he occasionally





transgresses a law because of temptation, and even for a day-old child, it
is a mitzvah to violate the Shabbos to save him. [Even] if the patient
refuses, we force him to accept help. It is a grave sin to carry piety to
the point of idiocy, and refuse treatment because it would violate a law.
About such a person is it said: ""Only of the blood of your lives will I
demand an account."" One who is quick to desecrate the Shabbos for
the sake of a critically ill person, deserves praise. Even if a non-Jew is
present, [every] effort should be made that a Jew do [what is necessary].
Any person that desecrates Shabbos for the sake of a critically ill person,
even if it was found later to be unnecessary, will be rewarded. For
example, if the doctor said: ""This patient requires one dried fig [for
cure]"" and ten people ran and plucked one fig each and brought it, they
all will be well rewarded by Hashem, blessed be His Name, even if the
patient was cured [as a result of ] the first [fig]. Similarly, in any lifethreatening situation, even when the threat to life is uncertain, it is a
mitzvah to desecrate Shabbos for him, and to do any and all d'oraisa
prohibitions for him, because there is not a thing that stands in the way
of a life-threatening situation. The Torah was given only for the
purpose of [bringing] life, as it is said: ""That man shall do them and
live through them,"" and [the Sages] inferred: ""Live through them but
not to die on account of them."" This holds true except for the laws
concerning idolatry, illicit sexual relations and murder, where one must
die rather than transgress.
2

Any person who asserts: ""I recognize that this person is critically ill,""
and no experienced doctor is present who denies it; he may be relied
on, and the Shabbos may be violated for him. Even if he does not say it
with certainty but says that it seems to him that Shabbos should be
violated for him, we accept his opinion and violate Shabbos for him,





because [of the precept]: ""Where there is a possible threat to life we are
required to rule leniently."" If one doctor's opinion is that he is critical,
and requires a certain cure, and another doctor maintains that he does
not require it, or if the patient says that he does not require it, we
accept the opinion of the doctor who says that he requires it. If the
patient says that he needs a particular cure, but the doctor says that he
does not, we accept [what] the patient [says]. But, if the doctor says
that this cure is harmful for him, we accept [what] the doctor [says].
3

If a skilled physician, even a non-Jew, or someone who is
knowledgeable says that, although at present the patient is not in
danger, nevertheless, if a particular treatment is not done the condition
may deteriorate and become critical, even if the patient says that it is
unnecessary, we accept the doctor's opinion and violate the Shabbos. If
the doctor says that if a particular treatment is not done [the patient]
will certainly die, and if done he will possibly live; here, too, the Shabbos
may be violated.

4

Any internal injury [or wound] that begins at the lips inward, including
the teeth, where the wound resulted from a blow or a blister or
anything similar, the Shabbos may be violated for his sake without a
[medical] evaluation. Even if no one knowledgeable is present and the
patient says nothing, you may do for him anything that is usually done
during the weekdays. However, when it is obvious regarding that
illness, that it is possible to wait, and violating the Shabbos is
unnecessary, you may not violate it. Pain is not considered a ""wound.""
If you have a toothache and are suffering a great deal of pain to the
point that you feel ill all over, you may ask a non-Jew to extract it.




5


[For] a wound on the back of the hand or the back of the foot, as well
as any wound that was caused by anything made of metal, or for an
anal blister, as well as for one who swallowed a leech, or was bitten by a
rabid dog, or any snake, even if it is doubtful if it is poisonous, as well
as for someone who has a high fever, the Shabbos may be violated for
him. However, for an ordinary fever [Shabbos] is not violated, but
should be attended by a non-Jew.

6

One who is polycythemic (high blood pressure) should be bled
immediately. A fire may be made to warm one who was bled and feels
chilled, even in mid-summer.

7

One who has pain in both eyes, or there is pus in one of them, or if his
eyes are watering or bleeding, or any other symptom dangerous to the
eye, the Shabbos may be violated for him.

8

A patient who is critically ill and requires meat and [only] forbidden
meat is available, you may slaughter [an animal] for him rather than
give him forbidden meat, because we are concerned that, possibly, upon
discovering that he was fed forbidden meat, he will be nauseated by it.
However, in circumstances where there is no concern that he will be
nauseated by it, for instance, where he is a minor, or is mentally
incapacitated, he should be fed forbidden meat, and you may not
slaughter an animal for him on Shabbos.

9

Food that was cooked on Shabbos for the sake of a patient, is forbidden
to a well person on Shabbos. But, after Shabbos it is permitted
immediately even for a well person, if the cooking was done by a Jew.




10


If one is being forced to transgress even a serious sin for the moment,
the Shabbos should not be violated in order to save him from
committing the transgression. But, if he is being forced to convert and
to leave the fold of the Jewish people, even if he is a minor, it is
obligatory to exert all effort to save him, even if it is necessary to violate
Shabbos by [transgressing] a d'oraisa prohibition, just as it is obligatory
to violate Shabbos for someone who is critically ill; for it is written:
""The people of Yisrael shall keep the Shabbos."" The Torah tells us:
Violate one Shabbos for his sake so that he may keep many Shabbosos.
Even where it is doubtful whether the intervention will succeed or not,
nevertheless it is obligatory to violate Shabbos and attempt to do
whatever is possible, just as we violate [Shabbos] for a possible lifethreatening situation. However, one who is faithless and wants to
convert, Shabbos must not be violated for him [by doing] a d'oraisa
prohibition, because since he is at fault, we do not say to anyone: ""Sin
for the benefit of your friend."" Nevertheless, when it involves a
d'rabanan prohibition, such as walking beyond the techum, or to ride a
horse, or to ride on a wagon, as well as handling money; according to
some poskim it is permissible to violate Shabbos to save him.
"

As soon as a woman feels the first signs of labor, even if she is unsure, a
midwife may be summoned even [if she must come] from a great
distance.

2

A woman at childbirth is considered a critically-ill patient, and the
Shabbos may be violated for whatever she requires. However, if it can





possibly be done in an unusual manner, or by a non-Jew, it should be
done. She is considered ""a woman at childbirth"" when seated on the
birthing-stool, or as soon as there is a flow of blood, or if she doesn't
have the strength to walk on her own. Also a woman who has
miscarried more than forty days after having immersed herself [in a
mikveh] has the classification of a ""woman at childbirth.""
3

During the entire first three days, even if she says that it is unnecessary,
Shabbos may be violated for her. Afterwards, if she has no other illness,
but only the [usual] pain that follows childbirth, the rule is as follows:
then, up to seven days, if she says: ""I require it,"" [Shabbos] may be
violated for her sake, and if she says it is unnecessary then it is not
violated. The days referred to are counted from the day of the birth and
[they do] not [have to be three] twenty-four-hour periods. For example:
if she gave birth Wednesday in the late afternoon, then on Shabbos it is
considered more than three days [since the birth], and if she gave birth
Shabbos in the late afternoon then, the following Shabbos, it is
considered more than seven days. If there is the slightest possibility of
danger, because the woman is weak by nature, [then] one who is
lenient, and counts full 24-hour days, is not considered wrong.

4

Once seven days have passed, even if she says: ""I require [something],""
[Shabbos] may not be violated for her, but she is considered a noncritical patient until thirty days, and all her needs may be done [only]
by a non-Jew. However, even a Jew may heat the house for her if a nonJew is not readily available, even in mid-summer, because a woman in
confinement is considered critical for the first thirty days, as regards
being cold.

The newly-born infant may be washed. His umbilical cord may be cut,
his limbs straightened, and all his needs may be attended. However, if
he cannot survive, for example: he was born in the eighth month, he
may not be handled, but his mother may bend over him and nurse him
because of her pain caused by her milk.

Introductory Remarks to Chapter 94
Houses

usually

were

arranged

in

this

fashion

with

Throughout

these

endless

variations:

halachos,

when

reference is made to people living in a courtyard, it means people living in the houses
that open to the courtyard. In order to carry from the houses into the courtyard, all
residents had to join in making an eiruv. This is a rabbinical ordinance instituted by
King Solomon and his Court. Sometimes courtyards were adjoining each other,
having

only

one

exit

to

the

street,

(as

illustrated):

and sometimes each courtyard had its
own exit to the street. There are halachos of eiruv pertaining to such situations. When
the halachah refers to an alley, it denotes an area into which two or more courtyards





exit. See illustration.

In order to carry in

the alley, many requirements must be fulfilled. The halachos are complex and not
discussed in the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch. However, mention is made of partnership in
the alley. This is achieved when all the inhabitants of the courtyard that exit into the
alley jointly make a special eiruv, the details of which are not discussed in the Kitzur
Shulchan Aruch, but at times will be referred to in the footnotes.

Two or more Jews who reside in one courtyard, each living in his own
apartment, are forbidden to carry from the house into the courtyard, or
from the courtyard into the house. It is also forbidden to carry from
one house into the other, even without passing through the courtyard,
as for example, when there is a door or a window between one house
and the other house. It is a mitzvah for them to make an eiruvei
chatzeiros, so that they do not fall into transgression.
2

When two courtyards have a door between them, if they wish, all the
tenants of each courtyard may make a separate eiruv, whereby all the
tenants of the courtyard are permitted to carry into their own
courtyard; but any vessels that were in the house before Shabbos began,
are forbidden to be carried from one courtyard into the other. If they
wish, all the tenants of both courtyards can make one eiruv jointly, in
order that they should be allowed to carry, from one courtyard into the
other, even such vessels that were in the house when Shabbos began.
And if there is even a window between the courtyards that measures no
less than four tefachim wide by four tefachim high, and it is within ten
tefachim above the ground, and it has no grate, [the tenants of both





courtyards] may also make a joint eiruv. But if it is less than that, they
cannot make a joint eiruv. If there is a window between two houses,
even if it is higher than ten tefachim, they can make a joint eiruv,
(because the house is considered as filled).
3

[If there are] two courtyards, one behind the other, and the tenants of
the inner courtyard have no other exit to the street than through the
outer courtyard, if [the tenants of both courts] wish to do so, they may
make a joint eiruv. If they did not make a joint eiruv, then if the
tenants of the inner court alone made an eiruv, they are permitted to
carry in their own court and the tenants of the outer court are
forbidden [to carry]. If the tenants of the inner court did not make an
eiruv, but the tenants of the outer court alone made an eiruv, then the
eiruv is of no use to them, because, since the tenants of the inner court
have a right of passage through the outer court, they prohibit the
tenants of the outer court [from carrying in their own court]. This is
true only if the people of the inner court did not make an eiruv. For
then, since they forbid one another [to carry] in their own place
(court), it is ""a foot (referring to the person) which is forbidden [to
carry] in its own place,"" and a ""foot forbidden in its place"" forbids
[others] also in another place. But if they made an eiruv by themselves,
and they are allowed to carry in their own court, then it constitutes ""a
foot permitted [to carry] in its own place,"" and they do not forbid
carrying even to the tenants of the outer court. Consequently, if there is
only one Jewish tenant in the inner court, since he is not forbidden to
carry in his own court, he cannot cause a prohibition to be imposed [on
the tenants of the outer court]. If two tenants live in the inner court
and they did not make an eiruv, even though only one tenant lives in





the outer court, since they are ""a foot forbidden in its own place,"" they
also forbid the single tenant.
4

When houses are built with a second story, and a balcony in front of
them, from which the tenants go into the courtyard through a stairway,
and from the courtyard into the public domain, they are govorned by
the same [laws] that apply to two courts, one behind the other, and the
balcony is considered as the inner court.

5

A house that has two apartments with a lobby through which you enter
both apartments, and the apartments are occupied by two tenants, they
are forbidden to carry anything even from their apartments into the
lobby. Similarly, even if one apartment is divided into two rooms
occupied by two tenants, even though the occupant of the inner room
has no other exit than through the outer room, which leads into the
courtyard, nevertheless, they may not carry anything, even from one
room into the other until they make an eiruv. (If the two houses or
apartments belong to one person, and he rented an apartment to
someone, and he also has ""a hold on the apartment,"" see Shulchan
Aruch 370 and Chayei Adam 73: 3–4.)

6

How do you make an eiruv? The mitzvah done to perfection is for one
of the tenants of the courtyard, to take one whole loaf of his own bread
on erev Shabbos and confer a share of it, through another person, to all
the tenants of that court. This is done by saying to that other person, in
any language he understands, as follows: ""Take this loaf and acquire it
on behalf of all the Jews who live in this courtyard, (or in these
courtyards)."" This person then takes the loaf and raises it one tefach.
Then the one who is making the eiruv takes it from him and recites the





berachah, Baruch atah Adonai Elokeinu melech ha'olam asher kiddeshanu
bemitzvosav vetzivanu al mitzvas eiruv. [""Blessed are You, Hashem, our
God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His
commandments and commanded us concerning the mitzvah of eiruv].""
He then says, ""By means of this eiruv it will be permissible for us to
take out and to bring in from the houses into the courtyard and from
the courtyard into the houses and from one house into another, for all
the Jews who live in the houses of the courtyard."" Since they all
acquired a share in this loaf, and at the beginning of Shabbos it is in the
house of the one who made the eiruv, it is considered as if all the
tenants were living in this house, and therefore they are permitted to
carry from the houses into the courtyard, and from the courtyard into
the houses, and also in the entire courtyard.
7

It is essential [that the maker of the eiruv] should grant them ownership
only through a third party, therefore, he may not grant ownership
through his son or daughter who are minors, even if they do not eat at
his table, because their hand is considered an extension of his own
hand. But through another minor he may grant ownership rights, (for
regarding Rabbinical ordinances, a minor can acquire rights for another
person); and, if possible, he should not grant ownership through his
wife whom he supports, and not through his son or daughter who are
bar or bas mitzvah who eat at his table [i.e. supported by him], for
according to some authorities, they too are considered as an extension
of his hand. However, if there is no other person present, he may grant
it through them. If his son is married, although he is supported by his
father, all authorities agree that the father may grant ownership rights
through him.




8


What is the amount (of bread) required for the eiruv? If there are
eighteen tenants or less, the amount is the size of a dried fig (which is
one third of an egg) for each tenant, except for the one who makes the
eiruv and keeps it in his house, (for he is not required to give bread [to
establish his residence] since he already lives in his house). If there are
more than eighteen tenants, even if there are one thousand, the size of
the eiruv is an amount of food enough for two meals, which is [a loaf of
bread] the size of eighteen dried figs, which is equivalent to six eggs.
Some authorities hold that it is the equivalent of eight eggs. (According
to their opinion a dried fig is equivalent to 1/3 and 1/9 of an egg.)

9

It is essential [that the one making the eiruv] should not resent it if a
neighbor eats it. If he does resent it, it is not a valid eiruv. He should,
therefore, be careful not to make the eiruv with food he prepared for
Shabbos.

10

The eiruv must be placed where it is accessible to every tenant at
twilight on erev Shabbos. Therefore, if there was a dead person there, or
in an adjacent apartment and one of the tenants is a kohein, who is
therefore unable to enter the place where the eiruv is at twilight, the
eiruv is void.

11

The eiruv should be made every erev Shabbos, and on Shabbos, Hamotzi
should be said over it, [and it should be eaten], as stated in Chapter
102:2 below, (for it has to be on hand) only at the beginning of
Shabbos). But if you are afraid that you might in the future forget [to
make an eiruv], you may make an eiruv with one loaf of bread for all
the Shabbosos until Pesach, and [in this case], when you say: ""By means





of this eiruv etc."" you should conclude: ""For all the Shabbosos until
Pesach which will come to us for goodness."" And [in this case] it is
necessary that the loaf is thin and well baked, so that it will not become
spoiled. For the Shabbos during Pesach you must make the eiruv with
matzoh that is kosher for Pesach.
12

You may not make an eiruv chatzeiros on Yom Tov. Thus, if a Yom Tov
occurs on erev Shabbos, you must make the eiruv on erev Yom Tov
[Thursday].

13

If a person eats in one place, and sleeps in another place, the place
where he eats is his legal residence as far as the laws of eiruv are
concerned. It is there that he prohibits [the other tenants from carrying
if they were not included in the eiruv] if he eats his own food there, in a
special room. But in the place where he sleeps he does not prohibit [the
other tenants to carry].

14

Regarding a visiting guest in a court, some authorities hold, that even if
he stays in a house by himself, as long as he does not stay there
permanently, but for thirty days or less, he does not prohibit the
tenants of the court [to carry]. Therefore all of them are permitted to
carry either from the tenants' houses, or from the house of the guest;
even if there are many guests [in the courtyard] and only one tenant.
This is true only if there is [at least] one permanent tenant, even if he is
a non-Jew, for then the guests become subordinate to him. But when all
[the people in the court] are guests, they do prohibit one another from
carrying, if each one eats in a special room for himself. If there is a nonJew among them they must rent his residence from him as will be
discussed below. Some authorities say that there is no difference





between a guest and a tenant; thus, as long as [the guest] has a special
room where he eats, his status is the same as that of a tenant. It is
proper to follow the stricter view initially, and they should make an
eiruv without reciting the berachah. But when it is done already, the
first opinion may be relied upon.
15

When a Jew lives with a non-Jew in the same courtyard, the non-Jew
does not prohibit [the Jew to carry], and he is allowed to carry from the
house into the courtyard and from the courtyard into the house. Even if
there are two or more Jews, but they live there under such conditions
that they do not need an eiruv, as explained in paragraph 13 above,
then the non-Jew does not prohibit them [to carry]. But if there are two
or more Jews [living there] who are required to make an eiruv, and a
non-Jew also lives there, he prohibits them [to carry], and they cannot
make an eiruv until they rent the premises. If two or more non-Jews
live there, they must rent [the premises] from each of them.

16

Even if the non-Jew lives in another courtyard but he has no exit to the
street other than through the court where the Jews live, or if he lives in
the attic and the stairway leads to the courtyard, he also prohibits them
[to carry].

17

If a courtyard belongs to a Jew, but he rented or lent an apartment to a
non-Jew, [the non-Jew] does not prohibit [the Jewish residents from
carrying], because [the Jew] did not rent or lend it to [the non-Jew]
with the power to prohibit the Jewish residents [from carrying], even if
the owner of the courtyard himself does not live there.




18


How do you rent [the premises from a non-Jew]? The Jew says to the
[non-Jew] ""Rent me your premises for so and so much money,"" and he
does not have to explain to him that it is in order to make carrying
permissible. However, if he says to him ""Give me permission,"" even
though he explains to him, ""in order that I may be permitted to carry
in the courtyard,"" it is not valid.

19

You may rent [the premises] even from the [non-Jew's] wife and even
from his servant.

20

If you rented the premises without specifying any definite period of
time, it remains valid as long as the non-Jew does not change his mind,
and he still lives there. However, if the non-Jew moves away from there
and another non-Jew moves in, you must renew the rental agreement
with the second [non-Jew]. If you rented [the premises] for a specific
time, and during that time the non-Jew rented his apartment to
another non-Jew, then the original rental agreement is sufficient. But if
the non-Jew died or he sold it to another non-Jew during this time, you
must rent it again from the heir or from the buyer. And if you rented it
from his servant, if you rented it without specifying a time, it is valid
only as long as the servant is there. But if you rented it for a certain
length of time, then even if the servant left, the lease remains in force
until that time expires.

21

Whenever a rental [from a non-Jew] expires and you have to make a
new lease, you also have to make a new eiruv; for an eiruv is not
automatically renewed.




22


If it is impossible to rent the premises from [the non-Jew], one of the
Jews should ask him to lend him a special place on his premises, to
place an object there. And he should then put the object there and
through this, the Jew acquires that place. Even if he removed the article
from there before Shabbos, nevertheless, since the Jew had the right to
leave that object there on Shabbos, it is considered as if he had a share
in the apartment. This Jew may then rent the premises to all the
residents of the courtyard.

23

An apostate or a person who publicly desecrates the Shabbos (according
to some authorities, even if it is only a Rabbinic prohibition), is
considered as a non-Jew, and you must rent his premises from him.

24

In many communities they equip all alleyways and streets with an eiruv
(by installing the form of a door [tzuras hapesach] or something
similar), and they rent the property rights from the non-Jews, in order
to be able to carry throughout the city. It is essential that all the
procedures are performed by a Rav who is an expert, and well versed [in
these halachos]. In these communities it is customary to place the eiruv
in the synagogue, (because the laws of partnership apply to it, and it is
not necessary [to place it] specifically in a dwelling).

25

In communities, however, where the city is not equipped with an eiruv,
then, even when they make eiruvei chatzeiros for the residents of the
courtyard in which the synagogue [is located], it is forbidden to put the
eiruv in the synagogue, but it must be put in one of the dwellings.

26

If a city-wide eiruv became defective on Shabbos, the residents of every
courtyard that is properly [surrounded with partitions] in which there





is no break [large enough] to make [carrying there] forbidden,—even if
that courtyard contains many houses—are permitted to carry there the
entire Shabbos. Even if the eiruv is deposited in another premise which
is now separated from this courtyard, nevertheless, they are permitted
[to carry], because regarding this, we say, ""Once it was permitted on
that Shabbos, it continues to be permitted."" However, since there is
strong reason to be concerned that many people will fall into error and
carry [by mistake], even in places where it is now forbidden to do so,
since they are accustomed to carrying legally; therefore, if it is possible
to have it repaired by a non-Jew, it may be done. If the string of the
""form of the door"" was torn, and it is possible for a non-Jew to repair it
with a loop, or by making one knot and a loop over it, so much the
better.
27

If a Yom Tov occurs on erev Shabbos and the eiruv became defective,
even though the eiruv serves a need also on Yom Tov [of permitting you
to carry] articles you do not need [on Yom Tov], still we do not say that
since it was permitted on Yom Tov it should also be permitted on
Shabbos, because Yom Tov and Shabbos have two [distinctly different]
characters of holiness.
"
"1

On Shabbos and Yom Tov it is forbidden to walk more than 2, 000
amos from the place you were at the onset of Shabbos. This is [in
addition] to the space a person occupies which is four amos. This is true
only if you happen to be in the field at twilight, but if you stayed in a
city [at the onset of Shabbos,] then the entire city is considered your
place of residence. The outskirts of the city are also considered part of





the city. What are the outskirts [of the city]? An area of seventy and two
third amos. [This area] is considered part of the city, even though there
are no buildings there. This is called the karpeif [enclosure] of the city.
It is from the edge of this area that we begin to measure the techum
Shabbos.
2

A city surrounded by a wall, even if it is a very large [city], may be
traversed over its entire area, including its outskirts, and it is from there
that the Shabbos boundary is measured. A city not surrounded by a
wall, but whose houses are close to one another, so that the empty space
between one house and another is not more than seventy and 2/3 amos,
is considered as joined together and belonging to the city, even if it
would take many days to walk [from one end to the other]. And it is
from the last house that the karpeif [enclosure] and the Shabbos
boundary is measured.

3

Karpeif-enclosures are added only to cities but not to a single house; but
it is directly from the wall of the house that we begin to measure the
Shabbos boundary.

4

If there are two cities close to each other, we add a karpeif-enclosure to
each. Therefore, if the distance between [the two cities] is not greater
than two karpeif-enclosures, the two [cities] are considered as one city.

5

There are many halachos concerning measuring a Shabbos boundary
that are lenient, and it should be done only by someone well-versed in
these laws.

6

On Shabbos or Yom Tov, if you need to walk farther than the Shabbos
boundary, you must place an eiruvei techumim on erev Shabbos or on





erev Yom Tov. You must place it within the Shabbos boundary lines of
the city, in a place to which you would be permitted to walk [on
Shabbos]. The place where you put down the eiruv is then considered
as your place of residence. Therefore, you now have [the right to walk]
from there two thousand amos in any direction. Of course, it is selfunderstood, that whatever you gain on the side where you put the
eiruv, you lose on the other side. For example, if you place the eiruv at
the end of two thousand amos on the eastern side, you are forbidden to
walk any distance whatsoever on the western side, for you are already
distant from your place of dwelling a techum Shabbos, [2, 000 amos].
7

How do you make this eiruv? You take bread enough for two meals, or
relish, like onions or radish, or something similar, enough to eat with
bread for two meals, except for salt and water with which you cannot
make an eiruv, and go to the place where you want to put the eiruv;
and you should say: Baruch atah A-donoy Elokeinu melech ha'olam asher
kiddeshanu bemitzvosav vetzivanu al mitzvas eiruv. [Blessed are You,
Hashem, our God King of the Universe, Who has sanctified us with
His commandments and has commanded us concerning the mitzvah of
eiruv.] Then you should say: ""By means of this eiruv it shall be
permissible for me to walk from this place two thousand amos in each
direction,"" and then return home. You may place one eiruv for many
Shabbosos, but you should put it in a safe place, so that it will not be
lost or spoiled.

8

You may send the eiruv with a messenger who will place it for you. The
messenger should recite the berachah and then he should say: ""By
means of this eiruv it shall be permissible for so and so to walk etc. …""
The messenger must be bar mitzvah and of normal intelligence. But





you may not send [an eiruv] through a minor. Even if the messenger
does not return to the sender, you may rely on him [to have fulfilled
your mission], for we take it for granted that a messenger fulfills his
mission.
9

You may make one eiruv for many people, provided the eiruv consists
of the prescribed quantity of food for each one. [If one person makes
one eiruv for many people,] he must cause them to acquire a share in it
through someone else, as is done with eiruvei chatzeiros [eiruv of the
courtyards, see Chapter 94]. You should not make eiruvei techumin,
[eiruv of the boundaries] [for anyone, without] his consent. One who
makes [the eiruv for others], acting as the agent for all of them, should
say, ""It shall be permissible for so and so and for so and so [etc.]""
[mentioning all names]. And if he includes himself also, he should say:
""For myself and for so and so and so and so.""

10

The eiruv must be deposited in a place where it can be eaten on Friday
at twilight without violating a prohibition of the Torah. Therefore, if
you placed it in a hole in the ground, and covered it with dirt, the eiruv
is not valid. If you covered it with a stone, the eiruv is valid. If you put
it in a tree, if the tree is strong, the eiruv is valid. If you put it on a soft
tree or a reed the eiruv is not valid.

11

If you put the eiruv in the middle of a city, then the whole city is
considered as the place of your eiruv, and you may walk throughout the
entire city even if it is a very large [city]. [You may also walk] outside
the city, to the edge of its outskirts, as far as the Shabbos boundary, for
it is considered as though you lived in that city.




12


If there is a town within the techum that is either surrounded by walls
or equipped with an eiruv, that town is not measured [in the 2, 000
amos], and is counted only as four amos. This is true only when the
techum Shabbos reaches the town limits. For example, if [the distance]
from the eiruv to the town is 500 amos and the length of the town is
1,000 amos, then the town is figured at only four amos; and you [may
walk] an additional 1,496 amos from the town limits. [In this regard]
we make no distinction between the side [of the town] nearer the eiruv
and the side that is farther from the eiruv. But if the techum Shabbos
ends in the middle of the town, you are forbidden to walk farther than
that, since you [would be walking] outside the techum, for in this case,
the entire town is not considered as four amos.

13

The same halachah applies when you put the eiruv in a place that is
close to 2,000 amos outside the city. When you return to the city, and
the 2,000 amos from the place of the eiruv end at the beginning of the
city before [you reach] your house, you are forbidden even to return to
your house. (This is the opinion of most authorities and it is the
accepted halachah, see Eliyahu Rabba.)

14

An eiruvei techumin should be made only in order to do a mitzvah such
as to pray with a minyan, or to meet your Rebbe, or a friend who arrived
from a journey, or to (attend) a banquet in honor of a mitzvah, or to
take care of communal affairs, or if you had returned from a journey
and wanted to go home, or similar things.

15

An eiruvei techumin should not be placed on Shabbos or Yom Tov.
Therefore, if Yom Tov occurs on erev Shabbos and you want to walk





[beyond the techum] on Shabbos, you have to put the eiruv in place on
erev Yom Tov [Thursday]. Similarly, if Yom Tov occurs on Sunday and
you want to walk [beyond the techum] on Yom Tov, you must place the
eiruv on erev Shabbos. (The halachah of one who makes an eiruv ""with
his feet"" [is found] in Shulchan Aruch 409: 7. The halachos of a Yom
Tov [that occurs] near Shabbos, or the two days of Yom Tov of the
Diaspora, on which you want to make an eiruv, for one day in one
direction and for the second day in the opposite direction, are found in
Shulchan Aruch 416.)
16

The property and livestock of a person are subject to the same laws that
limit this person. Thus, to a place where he is not allowed to walk no
one else is allowed to take them either. If he loaned them to someone or
rented them or delivered them to someone for safekeeping, they are
subject to the laws applying to the one in whose custody they are. Even
if this is a non-Jew, the cattle and the vessels acquired shevisah at the
[non-Jew's] place. Moreover, even the property of a non-Jew acquires
shevisah wherever they are [on erev Shabbos] at twilight.

17

If a non-Jew brought fruit and there is no reason to be afraid that it was
picked on Shabbos (or any other article about which there is no reason
to fear that labor was performed on it), it is only forbidden because it
has been brought from beyond the techum. If [the non-Jew] brought
[the fruit] for himself or for another non-Jew, then a Jew is permitted
[to make use of it] at once, even to eat it. It is forbidden to carry it
more than four amos, unless [the non-Jew] brought [the fruit] into the
house, or if the city is equipped with an eiruv. Then you may carry it in
the entire city. For every place where you are allowed to carry is
considered as [your] four amos. But if he brought it for a Jew, it is





forbidden for this Jew and for his entire family until the ""kedei
sheyei'asu"" has passed after nightfall, which is the time it would take to
bring it [fom its point of origin]. Nevertheless, he is allowed to carry it
within four amos or in a place where carrying is permitted. And when
there is doubt if [the fruit] was brought from outside the techum, it is
also forbidden, unless it is likely that it was not brought from outside
the techum.
18

We have an accepted rule that the prohibition of techumin does not
apply above ten tefachim [above the ground]. Therefore, if you boarded
a ship on erev Shabbos, before the beginning of Shabbos and the ship
sailed, even on a long voyage, nevertheless, when it reaches port on
Shabbos and you go ashore; you are permitted to walk from there 2,
000 amos in any direction. Because, there is no doubt, that during the
entire voyage of the ship you were always above ten tefachim from the
ground, and did not acquire shevisah until you landed. However, if
during the Shabbos you went ashore and returned to board the ship
again; since you were on land during Shabbos, you acquired shevisah
there. If the ship sails afterwards beyond the techum, then you have on
the ship only four amos within which you may walk, which is the
halachah regarding someone who goes beyond the techum. If the ship
reached a place that is less than ten tefachim above the ground, you have
acquired shevisah there. If you are in doubt whether or not the ship was
at such a place you may be lenient.
"
"1

[On Shabbos night] the Maariv prayer should be said at a later hour,
[than on weekdays] and when saying ""Vehu rachum"" and ""Barechu,"" the





chant should be drawn out in order to add from the mundane to the
sacred. In the Maariv Shemoneh Esrei we say ""Attah chonantanu."" If you
forgot and omitted it, and you remembered before saying Hashem's
Name of that berachah, you should say it at the point you remembered
and go on to conclude: ""vechoneinu etc."" But, if you did not remember
until after mentioning Hashem's Name, [then,] finish the blessing,
""Chonein hadoas,"" and you need not repeat [the Shemoneh Esrei] for you
will recite Havdalah afterwards over wine. But great care should be
taken not to do any melachah, nor to taste anything before reciting
Havdalah over wine. If you did a melachah or ate something you must
repeat the [Maariv] Shemoneh Esrei. (If you do not have wine over
which to recite the Havdalah, and you forgot to say ""Attah
chonantanu,"" other rules apply in this case.)
2

After completing the Shemoneh Esrei, half-Kaddish is said followed by
""vihi no'am,"" [""may the pleasantness""] which is said because it is a
Psalm of blessing with which Moses blessed Israel when they completed
the construction of the Tabernacle. It should be recited while standing.
It is customary to repeat the final verse: ""Orech yamim etc."" [""With
long life""]. After that ""Ve'atah kadosh"" [""and You, Holy One""] and the
kedushah-order are said, since it relates to ""Vihi no'am,"" because
through the construction of the Tabernacle, the Shechinah dwelled
amongst Israel. This is [the interpretation of ]: ""And You, Holy One,
are enthroned upon the praises of Israel."" If Yom Tov occurs during the
following week, even if on Friday, ""Vihi no'am"" and ""Ve'atah kadosh""
are not said, since included in ""Vihi no'am"" is [the prayer:] ""Umaasei
yadeinu koneneihu"" [""and the work of our hands—establish it""].
Therefore, it is required that all six weekdays be fit for work. And once
""Vihi no'am"" is not said then, ""Ve'atah kadosh"" is also not said, because





they relate to one another. After [completing] ""Vihi no'am"" and
""Ve'atah kadosh,"" whole- Kaddish is said followed by ""Veyiten lecha"" and
""Aleinu."" These prayers are said after Maariv on Shabbos night, so that
the Bnei Yisroel can prolong the completion of the order [of prayers],
in order to delay the return of the wicked to Gehinnom; because it waits
for them until the last assembly in Israel completes its order [of
prayers].
3

Just as it is a mitzvah to sanctify Shabbos upon its arrival over a cup of
wine, so, too, it is a mitzvah to sanctify it at its departure over a cup of
wine, which is done at Havdalah. A berachah is also recited over
aromatic spices and over a candle. Women, too, are obligated [to recite]
Havdalah. They should, therefore, be very attentive to the Havdalah
berachah. When wine is unavailable, Havdalah is recited over beer or
mead, or any beverage considered a popular drink with the exception of
water.

4

Once twilight arrives it is forbidden to eat or drink anything except
water prior to Havdalah. However, if you prolong the Third Meal even
into the night, you may [continue to eat and drink] since you began
when it was permitted. You may also drink from the cup [of wine] [over
which] Birkas Hamazon was said because it, too, is part of the [Third]
Meal, provided that you are always accustomed to reciting Birkas
Hamazon over a cup of wine. But, if you sometimes recite Birkas
Hamazon without a cup [of wine] (because you rely on the poskim [who
hold] that Birkas Hamazon does not require wine,) it is forbidden at
this time to drink from the Birkas Hamazon wine, prior to Havdalah.




5


Similarly, you may not do a melachah prior to Havdalah. Women who
need to put on the lights prior to Havdalah, should first say: ""Blessed is
He who distinguishes between the sacred and the mundane, between
light and darkness, between Israel and the peoples, between the Seventh
Day and the six work days, blessed is the One Who distinguishes
between the sacred and the mundane."" If Yom Tov occurs on Sunday,
they should conclude: ""The One Who distinguishes between the sacred
and the sacred.""

6

If you prolong the Maariv prayer at the end of Shabbos or prolong your
meal into the night, you may ask even a Jew, who has already prayed
and said ""Attah chonantanu,"" to do a melachah for you. You may benefit
or partake of his melachah, though you will afterwards mention
Shabbos during Birkas Hamazon.

7

When pouring [wine into] the Havdalah fill it to the brim until it
overflows slightly, [for this is] a sign of blessing. Lift the cup in your
right hand and the aromatic spices in your left, until after you recite
""… borei peri hagafen,"" [""… Creator of the fruit of the vine""]. Then put
the cup in your left hand and the spices in your right and recite ""…
borei minei vesamim,"" [""… Creator of various kinds of spices""].
Afterwards recite the berachah over the candle. Then again take the cup
in your right hand and recite the berachah ""hamavdil."" After concluding
[the berachah], sit down and drink the whole contents of the cup by
yourself. And the little left in your cup you pour out and with it
extinguish the candle. You apply some of it to your eyes to show your
esteem for the mitzvah. It is customary for women not to drink from
the Havdalah cup.




8


It is advisable to add some ""pizem"" [musk] to the besamim because it is
agreed that its proper berachah is ""… borei minei vesamim."" It is
preferable to also take a myrtle since a mitzvah was done with it once,
let a mitzvah be done with it once more.

9

It is preferable that the candle be made of wax, and of single candles
braided together forming a torch. If you do not have [such a candle]
you may recite the berachah on two other candles whose flames have
been brought together so that they form a torch. It is customary after
reciting ""… borei me'orei ha'eish,"" to look at your fingernails, preferably
the fingernails of your right hand. It is also customary to look at the
palm of your right hand. You should bend the four fingers over the
thumb into the palm of your hand and look at your fingernails and at
your palm simultaneously, then straighten your fingers and look at the
fingernails from the back.

10

One who is blind does not recite a berachah over the candle. One who
has no sense of smell does not recite a berachah over besamim.

11

If after you recited the berachah on the wine and you are holding the
besamim in your hand and intended to recite the berachah over them,
you inadvertently said ""borei me'orei ha'eish,"" and immediately realized
[your error] and concluded ""borei minei vesamim"" the berachah is valid
for the besamim. You may then recite the berachah on the candle. But, if
you intended the berachah for the candle, it is valid for the candle, and
recite the berachah on the besamim afterwards.

12

It is a mitzvah to increase the lighting slightly on Shabbos night and to
recite the zemiros to escort the Shabbos upon her departure. This is a





sign of respect similar to a king being escorted upon departing from the
city. Eliyahu the Prophet is mentioned and we pray that he come and
bring us the tidings of the Redemption. [We wait until Shabbos night]
because Eliyahu will not arrive on Friday so as not to disturb Israel in
its preparation for Shabbos. On Shabbos, too, we do not pray for his
coming since there is a possibility that the laws of techum apply above
ten tefachim, making it impossible for him to come on Shabbos;
therefore, as soon as Shabbos is over and it is now possible for him to
come, we pray that he come and bring us good [tidings]. The Midrash
also states that at the end of every Shabbos, Eliyahu enters the Garden
of Eden and sits under the Tree of Life and inscribes the merits of the
Israelites who keep the Shabbos. We, therefore, mention him then for
good.
13

If possible, you should fulfill the mitzvah of the melaveh malkah meal
with bread and a hot dish. Set your table appropriately in honor of the
departure of Shabbos. One who cannot eat bread should at least eat
some cake or fruit.

14

[Even] if you already recited Havdalah, you may recite Havdalah for
your children that have reached the age of training so that they fulfill
their obligation, and certainly for an adult, provided they cannot recite
Havdalah for themselves. However, one who is able to do so for
himself, must himself recite the Havdalah. When reciting Havdalah for
others, upon reciting ""borei minei vesamim,"" you must smell the spices
yourself so that your berachah not be in vain, (because the berachah,
""borei minei vesamim"" at Havdalah was established solely for man's
pleasure). Havdalah should not be recited solely for women by someone





who has already recited Havdalah (because some hold that women are
exempt).
15

If you forgot, were unable, or purposefully failed to recite Havdalah on
Shabbos night, you may do so until the end of Tuesday. However, do
not recite the berachah over the besamim or the candle, only the
berachah, ""borei peri hagafen"" and the berachah, ""Hamavdil."" Once
Tuesday has past, Havdalah can no longer be recited, because the first
three days of the week are called ""the days after Shabbos"" and are
considered the end of Shabbos, whereas the last three days are called
""the days before the coming Shabbos"" and have no relationship to the
Shabbos past.
"
"1

Some people are accustomed to fast on Erev Rosh Chodesh and recite
the order of Yom Kippur Kattan, for on this day we are forgiven for all
the sins committed in the past month. It is likened to the Seir [goat
offering] of Rosh Chodesh, and as we say in the Mussaf service, ""It is a
time of atonement for all their generations."" Each communifty should
follow its own custom.

2

It is a Mitzvah to have an elaborate meal on Rosh Chodesh, and if it
occurs on Shabbos, an extra cooked dish should be prepared in addition
to those prepared on other Shabbasos.

3

It is permissable to do Melacha on Rosh Chodesh, but women
customarily refrain from doing melachah on this day. This is a proper
custom and it should not be made trivial for them.




4


Hallel should be said while standing, and without interruption. You
should try to say it with the congregation. Therefore, if you arrive at the
synagogue when the congregation is about to say Hallel, you should say
Hallel with the congregation and recite the other prayers later. And if
you are saying Pesukei Dezimrah (that is from Hodu until after Az
Yashir), you should read Hallel with the congregation without saying
the berachah before or after the Hallel, because the berachah of Baruch
Sheamar and the berachah of Yishtabach also fulfill the berachah for
Hallel. And only on Rosh Chodesh can this be done, because then parts
of the Hallel are omitted. This is also true for Chol Hamoed and the last
days of Pesach. But when the entire Hallel is recited, this cannot be
done. And if you recite Hallel without the congregation, and two [or
more] other persons are present, you should say Hodu in their presence
in order that they may respond, for the expression Hodu (thank
Hashem) implies that you are addressing others [to do so]. The law of
saying Hallel in the house of a mourner, may the Merciful save us, is
found further in Chapter 207.

5

After Hallel the whole Kaddish is recited, a Seifer Torah is taken out,
and four (men) are called (to the Torah). The kohein reads three
pesukim (verses), which are Vayedaber, Tzav, Veamarta. The Levi repeats
the verse of V'amarta, and adds: Es hakkeves echad, veasiris haeifah. The
Yisroel reads from olas tamid until uverashei chodsheychem. And the
fourth person reads from uverashai chodsheychem.

6

On Rosh Chodesh it is forbidden to fast and to eulogize someone, and
the prayer Tziduk Hadin is not said.




7


It is obligatory to sanctify the moon each month. It should not be
sanctified until it is definitely night, which is when its light is visible on
the ground, so that you can derive some use from its light. If the moon
is covered by a cloud, it should not be sanctified unless the cloud is thin
and scanty. If you began the berachah, and afterwards it was covered by
the cloud, you should complete the berachah. But if you estimate that
you will not be able to complete the berachah before it is covered, it is
forbidden to begin (the berachah).

8

The moon must be sanctified only under the heavens (open sky) and
not under a roof. If, however, there is no clean place [outside] or
because of another situation beyond your control [you cannot go
outside]; you may sanctify it inside the house through the window.

9

It is a mitzvah performed in its excellence to sanctify the moon on
Motzai Shabbos when you are in high spirits and dressed in fine clothes.
But if Motzai Shabbos will occur after ten days from the appearance of
the new moon, or if it is feared that you will then be unable to sanctify
it, you needn't wait until Motzai Shabbos. It is a mitzvah to sanctify the
moon in the gathering of a multitude of people, since in the multitude
of the people is the glory of the King. But it should not be postponed
because of this, because the mitzvah to ""perform precepts promptly""
overrides the mitzvah of ""in the multitude of people.""

10

The moon should not be sanctified until the passage of at least three
days from the appearance of the new moon, and some wait seven days.
And when Motzai Shabbos occurs before seven days, you should not
wait, but you should sanctify it on Motzai Shabbos. The moon may be





sanctified only up to the expiration of half the period of twenty-nine
days twelve hours and 793 chalakim (29 days, 12 hours, 793/1080) that
is fourteen twenty-four hour days and eighteen hours and twenty two
minutes from the appearance of the new moon.
11

The moon should not be sanctified before Tisha B'av, and not when
one is a mourner, unless his mourning period will not end within the
ten full days after the appearance of the new moon. In such a situation,
it may be sanctified during the days of mourning. The moon should
not be sanctified on a fast day until some food has been eaten. But in
any case after Yom Kippur, since we leave the synagogue in a joyous
spirit, confident that our sins were forgiven, we sanctify it immediately.

12

The moon should not be sanctified on Friday night, nor on the night
of Yom Tov except in extenuating circumstances, as when by Motzai
Shabbos, the prescribed time will have passed.

13

A blind person is permitted to sanctify the moon.

14

If the moon is visible at the beginning of the night, before you began
the Maariv prayer, and there is still time, [i.e., there are still] a few more
nights in which to sanctify it, you should say the Maariv prayer first,
and then sanctify the moon, because a mitzvah that is constant takes
precedence over one that is only periodic, and also the reading of the
Shemah is a Biblical precept. If, however, there remains only two or
three nights [to the end of the period], since the time is short, it may
happen that the moon will be covered by clouds. And in the rainy
season even if there remain yet four nights [to the end of the period], it
may happen that it will become covered by clouds, and therefore you





should first sanctify the moon (and then say Maariv). If the moon
becomes visible at the time you are saying Kerias Shema and its berachos,
and the time is so limited that before you complete Shemoneh Esrei the
time of sanctification will have passed, you may interrupt even in the
middle of the berachos of Kerias Shema, or in the middle of Kerias
Shema in order to sanctify it. But if possible, you should complete the
section [you are reading,] and sanctify the moon between the sections.
15

If in the month of Adar (the moon) was not visible until the night of
the fourteenth which is the time for the reading of the Megillah, the
moon should be sanctified first and the Megillah read afterwards. And if
it became visible during the reading of the Megillah, then if there will
be time even after the reading is concluded to sanctify the moon, the
reading of the Megillah is not interrupted; but if by the time the
Megillah is concluded, the time for sanctification will pass, and the
entire congregation has not yet sanctified the moon, the reading is
interrupted for the sanctifying, and afterwards the Megillah is
concluded. But if only one person has not yet sanctified the moon, and
if he stops to sanctify it, he will have to finish the Megillah alone, he
must not interrupt, because the public reading of the miracle takes
precedence.
"
"1

Any melachah (work) that may not be done on Shabbos, is also
forbidden on Yom Tov. And just as on Shabbos it is forbidden to have
work done even by a non-Jew, so it is forbidden on Yom Tov. And just
as a person is commanded to allow his animals to rest on Shabbos, so,
too, is he commanded on Yom Tov. Yom Tov differs from Shabbos only





with regard to the preparation of food, for it says (concerning Yom
Tov), ""Only that which is eaten by any soul, that alone may be
prepared by you."" This includes kneading, baking, slaughtering, and
cooking. Carrying, and lighting a fire are permitted on Yom Tov, even if
not needed for preparing food, but for some other necessity. Our Sages,
of Blessed Memory, had this rule by tradition regarding these (two
melachos), of which it is said: ""Since these labors are permitted for the
purpose of preparing food, they are also permitted for purposes other
than preparing food,"" but for some other necessity. However, a yahrzeit
candle may not be lit on Yom Tov.
2

You may not make cheese on Yom Tov, neither may you make butter on
Yom Tov. Likewise, you may not curdle milk, by putting it in a stomach
or by putting a substance into it to cause the milk to thicken and
coagulate. Also, you may not skim off the cream from the milk, unless
you leave a little on the milk, the same way it must be done on
Shabbos. This, too, is permitted only for as much as you need for that
day, but not for the following day, because it amounts to preparing [on
Yom Tov for a weekday, which is forbidden]. But if you fear that it will
spoil, you may have it skimmed off in the aforementioned manner by a
non-Jew.

3

Should spices that are ground before Yom Tov lose their flavor, [before
Yom Tov,] they may be ground on Yom Tov, if done in an
unconventional manner: such as inclining the mortar on its side,or by
pounding them on the table, or similar unconventional procedures.
Horseraddish that is grated on a (hand-)grater may not be grated into a
dish as is usually done on weekdays, but onto a tablecloth. You may not
grind coffee with a grinder, but you may pound it with a mortar in an





unconventional manner. It is best to prepare everything on the day
before Yom Tov. Foods that do not lose their flavor, certainly should be
crushed the day before Yom Tov, but if you forgot (to do it before), you
are permitted to do it in an unconventional manner on Yom Tov. All
that was mentioned is only permitted for as much as you need for that
day, but not for the next day, and you should be stringent to prepare
only as much as you need for that particular meal. When grinding
matzoh, you should also be careful about this.
4

You may not split wood, or even break it by hand. It is also forbidden
to gather wood from a place where it is scattered about.

5

Arranging wood on top of the stones to start a fire is prohibited,
because you are making a tent; for it is like erecting two walls upon
which you are placing a roof. But you can do it in an unconventional
manner, that is by holding the wood in your hand and placing the
stones underneath. Similarly, when you place a pot on stones to light a
fire underneath, you must hold the pot in your hand and place the
stones under it; but you may not place it (the pot) on top of the stones.

6

You may not fan a fire with a bellow, because it is forbidden to do so in
a professional manner. It is customary to permit (the use of ) a
domestic-type bellows by operating it in an unconventional manner,
holding it in an upside down position, but with a professional bellows
it is forbidden, even in an unconventional manner.

7

You may sort all the legumes you need for that day, but not with a sieve
or strainer. Neither may you put them in water so that the refuse or the
edible part will float. But you may separate them by hand and pick out





whatever is easier for you; if it is easier to pick out the refuse,—pick out
the refuse, and if it is easier to pick out the edible part,—pick out the
edible part.
8

Flour that has already been sifted, but you wish to sift it a second time,
should be sifted by a non-Jew or you may do it in an unconventional
manner, turning the sieve upside down. Do the same when sifting
crushed matzos. Flour that has never been sifted, may be sifted only by
a non-Jew, in an unconventional way. It is forbidden to pick out refuse
from flour; for example, if pebbles or something similar fell into it. It is
forbidden to separate the large crumbs even from ground matzoh.

9

Kneading is permitted on Yom Tov. However, you should not measure
the flour but should take it by estimate. If you do not measure exactly,
but take less or more, it is permitted to (use a measuring utensil).

10

Dough for noodles and farfel used in soups should be kneaded on erev
Yom Tov, for if they are older they taste better. But if you did not knead
it erev Yom Tov, you may knead it on Yom Tov in an unconventional
way. For example, if you usually knead it on a board, you should knead
it on a tablecloth or on something similar. Cooked food that does not
spoil, like dried fruits and similar food should be cooked on erev Yom
Tov.

11

If you knead dough on Yom Tov, you may take challah from it. But you
may not burn (the challah portion), because holy things may not be
burned on Yom Tov. It is also forbidden to bake (the challah portion)
because it is not fit to be eaten, for we are all considered as ritually
unclean due to having come in contact with corpses. And it is





forbidden to handle (the challah portion), but while it is still in your
hand, you should put it in a safe place until after Yom Tov, and then
burn it. If you knead dough on erev Yom Tov, it is forbidden to take
challah from it on Yom Tov, but you may bake (the bread) and eat it,
leaving a little bread from which to take (challah) right after Yom Tov.
The portion you leave should be sufficient for separating challah and
have some left over.
12

It is forbidden to mix clay on Yom Tov, even if done by a non-Jew.
Therefore if you (need clay) to seal the oven in which you warm your
food, for Shabbos, you must prepare clay that was mixed, before Yom
Tov. Also taking mud from the street is forbidden, unless it was
prepared on erev Yom Tov, and placed in a corner. You should be careful
not to smear the clay or mud, but you should seal the oven with it
without smearing, for some authorities prohibit this (on Yom Tov) even
to keep food warm.

13

Domesticated poultry that is kept in the house or in the yard for food,
are permitted to be caught so that you may slaughter them for your
Yom Tov needs. But if not needed for food, it is forbidden to catch
them. And if they are new and not accustomed to (the house or yard),
it is forbidden to catch them even for food, even while they are in the
house. But at night, when they are roosting, it is permitted to take
them. In any event, you must be careful to select those you intend to
slaughter on Yom Tov before Yom Tov, lest the one you will take will
prove to be too lean and you will have handled it needlessly. Poultry,
not kept for food, but for laying eggs, are muktzeh.




14


It is forbidden to catch doves of a dove-cote or doves living in an attic,
even though they are accustomed to return to their nests and even if
you selected them before Yom Tov.

15

It is permitted to cut or burn the rings around the legs of poultry after
slaughtering. You may also sew up poultry when you stuff them, but
you must be careful to thread the needle on erev Yom Tov. If you did
not thread it before Yom Tov, it is forbidden to thread it on Yom Tov.
After the poultry is sewn up, you may burn the leftover thread.

16

It is forbidden to catch fish in a pond, that cannot be caught with your
hands, but (only) with a utensil. But if you can catch them with your
hands, you may catch them, even with a utensil. If there are many fish
in the pond you must designate before Yom Tov the one you wish to
take on Yom Tov, by making a mark on it; and if you need all of them,
you must designate all of them by saying before Yom Tov: ""I am
designating all of these fish for Yom Tov.""

17

If you are in doubt whether something was caught or prepared on Yom
Tov, it is forbidden to be used. If it is very urgent, you may be lenient
on the second day of Yom Tov, but not on [the second day] Rosh
Hashanah.

18

Living creatures that are muktzeh may not be given drink, nor may their
food be placed within a close reach, but it should be placed a short
distance away.

19

If you slaughtered poultry, and it was found to be tereifah, you are
forbidden to handle it, similar to other muktzeh (items). But if you





slaughtered an animal and it was found to be tereifah, you may put it in
a place where it will not spoil. But if it is impossible to put it away, so
that it will not spoil, you may sell it to a non-Jew, provided that no
price is set, and it is not weighed. Perhaps with regard to fattened geese
among which tereifos are generally found, you may be lenient.
20

You may not slaughter an animal on Yom Tov unless it is absolutely
necessary. It is forbidden to sell meat by weight and at a set price. But
you may give someone a piece of meat to be paid for after Yom Tov.

21

When you slaughter an animal (on Yom Tov) it is best not to examine
the lungs until after you have skinned it; for if you examine it and it is
found to be tereifah, it is forbidden to skin it. You are allowed to handle
the hide of an animal that was slaughtered that day in order to put it
away. But not to spread it on posts. Other hides are absolutely
forbidden to be handled. Also, feathers from a bird that was slaughtered
that day, may be handled in order to put them away. But it is forbidden
to handle any other feathers.

22

It is permited to salt meat to draw off the blood, even if it could have
been salted the day before Yom Tov, provided you need it for that day.
If you have more meat (than you need) and fear it might spoil, you may
salt all the meat together, no matter how much there is, and even that
which is not needed for today, for it involves the same labor. But meat
that has already been salted and its blood (drawn off ), and fish that
could have been salted on erev Yom Tov, is forbidden to be salted on
Yom Tov.




23


When baking pastry on Yom Tov, it is forbidden to shape it into figures
either by using a mold or by hand.

24

Levelling [or smearing] is forbidden on Yom Tov as on Shabbos.
Therefore, it is forbidden to warm a candle of wax or of tallow to make
it stick to the candlestick or the wall, for you might inadvertently smear
it. If the socket (of the candlestick) is full of tallow, you may clean it
with an object that is not muktzeh.

25

It is forbidden to extinguish a fire on Yom Tov. It is even forbidden to
extinguish it indirectly. Therefore, it is forbidden to place a burning
candle where the wind may blow it out, even though when you place it
no wind is blowing. It is also forbidden to open a door or a window
opposite a burning candle. See above chapter 80:2

26

It is permitted to cover a fire (on Yom Tov) with a vessel or ashes that
have been prepared (before Yom Tov). Even though it may be slightly
extinguished by being covered, nevertheless since your intention is not
to extinguish it, (and it is a melachah not needed for its own sake), it is
permitted for the needs of the Yom Tov. But it is permitted only when
you need it for that day. But for the needs of the (following) night it is
forbidden, for the night belongs to the second day.

27

You may not kasher utensils by placing them in boiling water, nor by
heating them until red hot, once they have become forbidden for use.
For the laws of immersing (new) utensils on Yom Tov, see Chapter 37
above.




28


The law regarding washing dishes on Yom Tov is the same as on
Shabbos. It is forbidden to wash dishes on the first day Yom Tov to be
used on the second day of Yom Tov.

29

It is forbidden to make a fire in order to heat the house, unless the cold
is so severe that the food congeals; then it is considered as required for
the preparation of food. But if the cold is not so severe, it is forbidden.
If done by a non-Jew, it is permitted

30

It is permitted to heat water to wash your hands but not for bathing
your whole body. If you need (warm) water to bathe a child, it is also
forbidden to heat the water for him, even through a non-Jew. But you
may heat a larger quantity because of him; thus when you need a little
water for cooking, it is permitted to heat even a large kettle, provided
you pour in all the water before placing it on the fire and do not add
any water after that. If the child is slightly ill, it is permitted to have the
water heated for him through a non-Jew.

31

It is forbidden to touch off a fire either from a flintstone, a glass or a
match.

32

You may not make mugmar, that is to scatter various spices over coals,
either in order to smell its fragrance, or to perfume the house or
clothing, for it is written ""For everyone,"" (Ex. 12:16 ). meaning, it must
be of a nature that everyone requires. But perfuming is only a necessity
for dainty and indulgent people. With regard to smoking tobacco, the
poskim, of blessed memory, disagree. Even according to those who are
lenient, you must be careful not to light it with a (burning) piece of
paper or a coal, because when you throw these on the ground, they will





be extinguished. It is easy to make the mistake of doing it on Yom Tov,
since you are used to doing so during the week. If there are letters on
the paper, either written or printed, and you burn it, the prohibition of
erasing also applies. Rather, you must light it from a (pre-existing)
flame. You also may not smoke a new pipe. It is also forbidden to grind
the tobacco on Yom Tov. It would seem that it is also forbidden to cut
off the tips of cigars.
33

Something which is not a full-scale melachah and yet is forbidden on
Shabbos in order to cure a patient who is not critically ill, is also
forbidden even on the first day of Yom Tov, or on both days of Rosh
Hashanah, unless it is done by a non-Jew. But on the second day of
Yom Tov, (except for the second day of Rosh Hashanah), it may be
done, even by a Jew. But a full-scale melachah may not be performed
for a patient who is not critically ill, even on the second day of Yom Tov
unless it is done by a non-Jew. (You should consult a halachic authority
before taking any actions in this matter.)

34

Carrying is permitted on Yom Tov. It is permitted to carry even things
that are not needed for preparing food, provided there is some other
need for it, but if it is totally unnecessary, it is forbidden to be carried
out [of the house] unless it is to a place where you are permitted to
carry on Shabbos. Concerning things that are needed for food, like kegs
of wine, you should not carry as heavy a burden as you do on weekdays;
but you should do it in a different way. If it is impossible to do it
differently, as when you have many guests, you may carry it the usual
manner.




35


All work that is permitted to be done on Yom Tov, may be performed
only for the needs of man, but not for animals, for it is written, ""Shall
be done for you,"" (Ex. 12:16 ) and it is expounded ""For you, but not for
animals."" Therefore it is forbidden to cook or carry out anything for the
needs of an animal, just as it is forbidden on Shabbos.

36

It is forbidden to cook or bake for the needs of a non-Jew but if you
have a non-Jewish servant, you are allowed to add food and cook it in
the same pot so that there should be enough for the servant too. But for
a distinguished non-Jew, it is even forbidden to add (food). Moreover,
even if you cooked or baked anything for yourself, you are forbidden to
invite a non-Jew to eat with you. But if the non-Jew is an ordinary
person, you may give him something of what you cooked or baked.
Baking bread, even if for your non-Jewish servant, is forbidden.

37

It is forbidden to carry out anything on Yom Tov for a non-Jew unless
to a place where you may carry on Shabbos.
"
"1

All Muktzeh, that is forbidden to be handled on Shabbos, is also
forbidden to be handled on Yom Tov. Some authorities say, things that
are purposely excluded from use and things excluded from use because
of their filth, even though they may be handled on Shabbos, they may
not be handled on Yom Tov. Therefore, fruits that were set aside for
sale, are forbidden to be handled on Yom Tov, unless you designate
them on erev Yom Tov by saying: ""I will eat from this fruit tomorrow.""





Concerning fruit that is scheduled to be sold a little at a time, you may
be lenient.
2

It is forbidden to handle an egg that was laid on Yom Tov, but you may
cover it with a vessel so that it should not break. If it was laid on the
first day (of Yom Tov), you may eat it on the second day, but if the
second day of Yom Tov occurs on Shabbos, it is forbidden on Shabbos
as well. Similarly, if the first day occurs on Shabbos, and it was laid on
that day, it is forbidden also on the following day, which is the second
day of Yom Tov. Whenever Shabbos borders on Yom Tov, whether
before or after it, if it is laid on either of these days, it is forbidden on
the other (also). And on Rosh Hashanah, even if it was laid on the first
day, it is forbidden on the second day. (The two days of Rosh
Hashanah are considered one long day, only concerning restrictive
measures, as in this case. In reference to the law regarding the other
yomim tovim, [however] when it is forbidden to prepare [food] on the
first day for the second day, there is no difference between other yomim
tovim and Rosh Hashanah. It is also forbidden to do so on Rosh
Hashanah, because to effect a relaxation of the law we do not say it is
considered one long day.) And if Rosh Hashanah occurs on Thursday
and Friday, even if it was laid on Thursday, it is forbidden on Shabbos
as well. If a hen was slaughtered and eggs found inside it, even if they
are fully developed, they are permitted even on that day.

3

Wood may not be handled except to burn as fuel, but (if ) not for
burning, it is forbidden to handle it. Therefore, you may not support a
pot or a door with a piece of wood.




4


Ashes (of wood) that was burned before Yom Tov may be handled on
Yom Tov because it was fit (before Yom Tov) for all the necessities of
man; such as to cover excrement with it or (to cover) saliva and similar
things. If the ashes are made from a fire that burned on Yom Tov, then
if it is still so hot that an egg can be roasted on it, it may be handled for
all the necessities of man. But if it has cooled off, it is forbidden to be
handled because it is nolad [newly created], (that is) yesterday it was
wood and today it is ashes, and this is more stringent than muktzeh.

5

If you ate nuts before Yom Tov, you may burn their shells (for fuel). But
if you ate them on Yom Tov, you may not burn their shells and it is
forbidden to even handle them. Similarly, other peels, even though they
are fit for animals, (may not be handled them) because they are nolad;
for yesterday they were fit for human consumption.
"
"1

It is a positive commandment of the Torah for the kohanim to bless the
people, as it is said: ""This is how you must bless the Children of Israel.""
Any kohein who is not disqualified and does not go up to the duchan
violates a positive commandment. But he is not in violation, unless he
is called upon to do so, as it is said: ""Say to them,"" and the Targum
translates: ""When they tell you."" It is the custom in our regions that the
kohanim bless the people only on Yom Tov because then, people rejoice
Yom Tov, and it is said that a happy heart will bless, and on Yom
Kippur there is (also) rejoicing over the forgiveness and pardon [of our
sins]. This is not true on other days. Even on the Shabbos days of the
whole year, people are worried about their livelihood and about being





idle from work. And even on Yom Tov, they only bless the people
during the musaf service, because they will soon leave the synagogue
and rejoice in the joy of Yom Tov. We are accustomed in our regions
that [even] when Yom Tov occurs on Shabbos, the kohanim do not bless
the people except on Yom Kippur; for even if it occurs on Shabbos,
they bless the people. There are communities that have the custom, that
on every Yom Tov, even when it occurs on Shabbos, the kohanim bless
the people; and this is more correct.
2

The Birkas Kohanim is pronounced only in a congregation of at least
ten adult males, including the kohanim, because they also are included
in the blessing, as it is said: ""And I will bless them"" (Numbers 6:27).

3

Before pronouncing the Birkas Kohanim the kohein may not drink wine
or any other intoxicating beverage. And if he feels faint, and wants to
eat some cake before musaf, he should listen to someone else's kiddush.

4

Before going up to the duchan the kohein must wash his hands up to
the wrist, that is the junction of the hand and the arm, just as the
kohanim sanctified their hands in the Beis Hamikdash before the
avodah, as it is said: ""Raise your hands in holiness and bless Hashem.""
It is questionable if they have to recite a berachah on this washing, or if
they do not have to say a berachah, since he made a berachah on
washing his hands when he got up in the morning. Because of the
doubt, the custom is not to recite a berachah. In the meantime if he
touched an unclean spot, it would be proper to say a berachah on this
washing, but this is not the custom. Every God-fearing kohein should
watch his hands carefully after washing his hands in the morning, not





to touch an unclean spot, so that he would need not repeat the
berachah.
5

A levi pours the water on the hands of the kohanim as it is said: ""And
also your brothers, the tribe of Levi bring near to you, and they will
accompany you and serve you."" If no Levi is present, a first born of the
mother, who is holy, should pour the water on his hands, and if there is
no firstborn present, it is better that the kohein himself pour it rather
than a Yisrael. If the Levi or firstborn who pours water on the hands of
the kohanim, has unclean hands, he must wash them first.

6

The kohanim are forbidden to go up to duchan wearing shoes. They
should remove their shoes before washing their hands. They should be
careful to hide their shoes under the benches, so that they cannot be
seen, out of respect for the congregation.

7

When the Chazzan begins Retzeih, all the kohanim must leave their
places to go up to the duchan. Therefore, they should wash their hands
before this, so that when the Chazzan says Retzeih, they will leave their
places to go up to the duchan with hands fit for the blessing. If post
facto they washed their hands afterwards (after Retzeih), it is acceptable.

8

When they go up to the duchan, they stand facing the Holy Ark (which
is) in the East, and they say Modim Derabanan with the congregation,
and after that they say: ""May it be your will Adonoy, our God, and
God of our fathers, that this blessing which you have commanded us to
bless your people, Israel, be a perfect blessing; that there be in it neither
stumbling nor iniquity from now and forever."" And they should
prolong this prayer until the Chazzan concludes with: Ulecha na'eh





lehodos, so that the congregation may respond amein also to this prayer.
The Chazzan says: Elokainu v'Eilokei avoseinu barecheinu vaberachah
etc. quietly, but the word kohanim he says in a loud voice, for with this
he calls the kohanim to bless (the people). And then he says quietly: am
kedoshecha ka'amur ""Your holy people, as it is said."" And after the
Chazzan proclaims: kohanim, they begin the berachah, all saying in
unison ""Baruch atah Adonoy, Elokeine Melech ha'olam, asher kiddeshanu,
bikedushaso shel Aharon,"" then, turning around facing the people they
complete the berachah ""vetsivanu levareich es amo Yisrael be'ahavah,""
and the congregation responds amein. But the Chazzan should not
respond amein, for this would constitute an interruption (in his prayer).
From the words ""With love,"" it is infered, that if the worshippers hate
the kohein, or the kohein hates the worshippers, he should not bless
them. In fact, it is dangerous for the kohein to bless them (under such
circumstances). Therefore, he should leave the synagogue (at that time).
If there is only one kohein in the synagogue, the Chazzan should not
say, kohanim in a loud voice, but the kohein should, on his own, turn
around to face the congregants.
9

They raise their hands to the level of their shoulders and stretch them
out, and separate their fingers in such a way that there are five spaces
between them. That is, between two fingers and two fingers there is one
space, and between the two fingers and the thumb, there is another
space, and the same with the other hand; making four spaces. And
between the two thumbs there is another space, which makes a total of
five spaces. This must be done, because it is written, ""He is peering
through the lattices,"" five open spaces. He must be careful that his
thumbs should not touch each other, so that there will be five spaces.
He must raise his right hand slightly above the left and the right thumb





should be above the left thumb. They should spread out their hands in
such a way that the palms of their hands are turned toward the ground,
and the back of their hands toward Heaven.
10

When the kohanim bless the people, they should not look around, nor
should they cause their mind to stray; but their eyes should be directed
downward as in prayer. The people should concentrate on the blessing,
and face the kohanim, but they should not gaze at them, neither should
the kohanim gaze at their hands. It is [therefore] their custom to lower
the tallis over their faces, extending their hands outside the tallis. The
worshippers also lower their tallissim over their faces in order not to
gaze at the kohanim.

11

The people standing behind the kohanim, are not included in the
blessing, unless they were compelled to stand there, but those standing
on the sides facing (the kohanim) are included in the blessing. In a
synagogue where the Holy Ark projects from the wall, the men
standing near the eastern wall, on the sides behind the kohanim, should
leave their places and stand in a place where they will be at least on the
sides facing the kohanim. If this is not possible, they are considered as
being compelled to do so, and are included in the blessing.

12

The Chazzan reads to them the Birkas Kohanim word for word, and
they repeat each word after him until the conclusion of the first verse,
whereupon the congregation responds amein. [In this manner, the
Chazzan reads the second and third verses as well.] After the second
verse and after the third verse, [the congregation also responds amein.]
The Chazzan should not recite (these verses) from memory but should
read them from the Siddur in order not to get confused. The Chazzan,





too, may respond amein after these verses. It is not considered an
interruption because it is necessary to the prayer. When reciting the
following words, the kohanim turn (partially) toward the South and
then to the North: yevarechecha, veyishmerecha, eilecha [""May He bless
you"" ""and safeguard you,"" ""to you""] vichuneka, eilecha, and lecha, [""and
be gracious to you"" to you"" ""you""] because these words are in the
second person. therefore, the kohanim turn also toward the sides, in
order to bless the entire congregation. They also turn thus when saying
the word shalom, because it is the conclusion of the blessings. While the
kohanim prolong the slow chant before saying the concluding words of
each verse, which are ve'yishmerecha, vichuneka and shalom, the
congregation recites (the prayer) Ribono shel olam etc. ""Master of the
Universe …"" The one who prompts the kohanim, even though he is not
the Chazzan, should not recite Ribono shel olam, in order not to get
confused. Certainly the Chazzan should not recite it because it would
be considered an interruption of the Shemoneh esreih. The kohanim
should chant only the customary melody in order to avoid confusion.
13

When the kohanim recite the words (of the Birkas Kohanim),the
congregants should not recite any verse, but should listen very
attentively to the words pronounced by the kohanim; for is there a slave
who, while receiving a blessing, would not listen attentively to his
blessing? But if the worshippers recite verses, they cannot concentrate
on the blessing. However, some are accustomed to recite various verses,
and they must be careful to recite them only when the Chazzan or
kohanim are chanting but not when they are saying the words.

14

After the conclusion of the Birkas Kohanim, the Chazzan begins reciting
Sim shalom, and then the kohanim turn their faces toward the Holy Ark





in the East, and say, Ribon Ha'olamin etc. ""Master of the Universe,"" and
they prolong this prayer until the Chazzan concludes the berachah
Hamevareich es Amo Yisrael bashalom [""Who blesses His people Israel
with peace,""] so that the congregation should respond amein to their
prayer as well. If they are unable to prolong this prayer until then, they
should also recite, Adir bamarom. [""Mighty One on high.""] On Rosh
Hashanah and Yom Kippur when everyone sings Hayom te'amtzeinu
[""Strengthen us this day,""] the kohanim should not begin reciting Ribon
Ha'olamim until that prayer is nearly ended, in order to finish at the
same time as the Chazzan.
15

The kohanim are not permitted to begin the berachah Asher kiddeshanu
etc. until the Chazzan completely finishes the word kohanim. The
Chazzan is not permitted to begin saying yevarechecha until the entire
congregation finishes answering amein. The same applies to the amein
the congregation says after Veyishmerecha, Vichuneka and Shalom. The
Chazzan must wait and may not begin saying Ya'eir, Yissa and Sim
Shalom until after the entire congregation has said amein. The kohanim
are not permitted to turn their faces away from the congregation to the
Holy Ark until the chazzan begins Sim Shalom. They are not permitted
to relax their fingers from their extended position until they turn their
faces away from the congregation. They are not permitted to leave the
duchan until the congregation responds amein after the berachah
Hamevoreich es amo Yisrael bashalom.

16

Whenever the kohanim turn around, either at the beginning or at the
end of (the Birkas Kohanim), they must always turn towards the right.
Therefore, at the beginning, when they are standing facing to the East,
they should first turn South and then West. After concluding Birkas





Kohanim, when they turn to face East, they should do so by first
turning North. When going down from the duchan, their faces should
be somewhat towards the Holy Ark, and they should walk backwards,
like a pupil taking leave of his master. When putting on their shoes,
they should not touch them. If they did touch them, they must wash
their hands.
17

An effort should be made to have a Chazzan, who is not a kohein. If he
is a kohein, he should not go up to duchan, and should not prompt the
kohanim, but someone else should stand alongside him to call kohanim.
He should also read to them the words Yevarechecha etc. and the
Chazzan should remain silent, until Sim Shalom. He commits no sin by
not going up to bless the people, even though the other man called out
kohanim, because this call is intended only for a kohein who is not
engaged in prayer, and who moved from his place during Retzeih. If he
is the only kohein present, then, in order not to forego the mitzvah of
the priestly blessings, he should go up to the duchan, relying on his
hand-washing in the morning. How should he act? He should move his
feet slightly while saying Retzeih, and continue until Ulecha na'eh
lehodos. [""And to You it is fitting to give thanks.""] Then someone else
says, Elokeinu veilokei avoseinu barecheinu vaberachah; the Chazzan then
goes up to the duchan, while the other man prompts him. After this,
the Chazzan resumes and recites Sim Shalom, but does not say Ribon
Ha'olamim until after reciting the kaddish. If he did not move his feet
while reciting Retzeih, he is not permitted to go up to the duchan.

18

If a congregation consists of kohanim only, then, if there are no more
than ten men, they all go up to the duchan. Whom do they bless? Their
brethren in the fields (countryside). And who responds, amein? The





women and the little children. Even if there are no women and
children, the lack of the amein response is not an obstacle. If there are
more than ten kohanim present, then as many as there are in excess of
ten go up to the duchan, and ten should remain to respond amein.
19

A kohein who had already blessed the congregation, and, afterwards,
went to another synagogue, if he wishes to do so, he may go up to the
duchan again, but if he does not wish to do so, even if he heard the call
kohanim, he is not obligated to go up, since he has already gone up
[and fulfilled his obligation.]

20

In our communities where it is customary for all kohanim to lower their
tallisim over their faces, a kohein who has a blemish on his face, is
permitted to pronounce the Birkas Kohanim. But a kohein who has a
defect on his hands, like bahakaniyos, i.e. a white lesion, or they are
speckled with small spots, or they are deformed, or he is unable to
separate his fingers, may not bless the people, because the people might
look at him, and be distracted. If he is well-known in his town, having
lived there for thirty days, and people recognize him, he may raise his
hands to bless the people. If his hands are discolored from dye or paint,
he may not raise his hands to bless the people because the people will
look at them. If most of the people of the town follow this trade [of
dyeing or painting], he is permitted to raise his hands in blessing. If he
does not know how to pronounce the letters properly, or if he
pronounces the letter shin like the letter sin, he may not raise his hands
to bless the people, unless the entire congregation pronounces it like
that. Any kohein, who does not raise his hands for the Birkas Kohanim,
should leave the synagogue before Retzeih is said, [and stay outside]
until the end of the priestly blessing.




21


A kohein, who once intentionally killed someone, even though he has
repented, may not raise his hands to bless the people. If he accidentally
killed someone, and has repented, he may raise his hands. Similarly, an
apostate who repented, may raise his hands to bless the people. A
kohein who married a divorcee, or a chalutzah, or who became ritually
unclean by contact with a corpse, for whom he is forbidden to defile
himself, may not raise his hands until he repents under the direction of
a Torah scholar. Other transgressions do not disqualify a kohein from
raising his hands. A chalal may not raise his hands to bless the people.

22

A mourner, before burial takes place, may not raise his hands. A
mourner, during the twelve months of mourning for his father or
mother, or, during the thirty days of mourning for other relatives, may
not raise his hands. He must leave the synagogue before Retzeih is said,
and stay outside until after Birkas Kohanim. In the event there are no
other kohanim in the synagogue, the mourner is permitted to raise his
hands during the twelve month period of mourning, for his father or
mother, or during the thirty days of mourning for other relatives. But
during the seven days of mourning, for example, if he buried his dead
on the Festival, even if there are no other kohanim, he may not raise his
hands to bless the people.

All Melachah that is permitted on Yom Tov is permitted only if it is
necessary for that day. But to prepare on the first day of Yom Tov for
the second day, (even of Rosh Hashanah), and certainly for a weekday,
is forbidden. However, if you need to cook for that day, you are





permitted to take a larger pot and fill it with meat or something similar,
even though you do not need so much for that day, and leave some for
the evening, or for the next day. Only in the case of cooked food, is this
permitted. because it tastes better when a large quantity of meat is
cooked in one pot. This is permitted provided you do not expressly
state that the leftovers will be for the night, or for the following day. It
should be cooked without mentioning anything at all. In the case of
other foods, it is forbidden to add (to that day's needs), if even a little
additional labor is entailed. because of adding to it.
2

Even something that is not actual work, such as bringing in water, or
even wine for kiddush and havdalah, is forbidden if it is for the next
day. It is also forbidden to put the candles in the candlesticks, or to
prepare the wicks and lamps on the first day of Yom Tov, for the night
(of the second day of Yom Tov), unless they are needed also before the
night, or they are lit in honor of the synagogue.

3

If a non-Jew brings fish or fruit on the first day of Yom Tov, and there is
reason to suspect that the fish were caught, or the fruit was picked on
that day, or brought in from outside the Techum, it is forbidden to
handle them on that day. In the evening on the second night of Yom
Tov it is permitted to use them. Thus, if the non-Jew knows you, and
gives them to you without quoting a price, you may take them and eat
them; except on Rosh Hashanah, when, even if they were brought on
the first day, they are forbidden on the second day.

4

If the non-Jew brings these things, as a gift for a Jew or to sell them to
him, they are forbidden even on the second day of Yom Tov. If Yom Tov
occurs on Thursday and Friday, and the non-Jew brings them on





Thursday, if it is very urgent, you are permitted to handle them on
Friday, and cook them in honor of Shabbos. On the Yom Tov of Rosh
Hashanah, even this, is forbidden.
5

Milk which non-Jew milks on the first day of Yom Tov, in the presence
of a Jew, may be used on the second day of Yom Tov. If the milking was
done on Shabbos, and Sunday is the first day of Yom Tov, it is
forbidden on Sunday. Milk that was milked on the first day of Rosh
Hashanah, is also forbidden on the second day, and also on the Shabbos
if it follows immediately.

6

Wicks that were lit on the first (night of ) Yom Tov and were
extinguished, may be lit on the second day of Yom Tov. But, on the two
days of Rosh Hashanah it is forbidden to light a wick on the second
day that was extinguished on the first day. It is forbidden to light them
even at the other end. However, you are allowed to handle them in
order to remove and replace them. The same law applies when Yom Tov
occurs the day after Shabbos.
"
"1

When Yom Tov occurs on Friday, it is forbidden to bake or cook in a
separate pot for Shabbos, unless you make an eiruv tavshilin on erev
Yom Tov. This is done as follows: Take some cooked or roasted food
that is eaten with bread, and take bread with it, and recite the berachah
Asher kideshanu bemitzvosav [""Who has sanctified us with the
commandments] vetzivanu al mitzvas eiruv. [""and commanded us
concerning the mitzvah of eiruv.""] And declare: ""By means of this eiruv
it will be permissible for us to bake, cook, keep food warm, kindle a





light and do anything necessary on Yom Tov for the sake of Shabbos.""
If you do not understand this language, you should say it in the
language you understand.
2

The cooked food must be the kind usually eaten with bread, like meat,
fish or eggs. But food not usually eaten with bread is not acceptable (for
eiruv tavshilin). The required amount of the food is a kazayis, and of
the bread, a kebeitzah. You should take a generous portion in honor of
the mitzvah. The bread you use should be a whole loaf and should be
placed [on the table], for lechem mishneh on Shabbos. You should eat it
at the third Shabbos meal; since one mitzvah was performed with it, it
is appropriate to use it for another mitzvah.

3

An eiruv tavshilin is effective in permitting you to prepare all your
Shabbos needs on Yom Tov [only when you make the eiruv] early in the
day; that is, there must be enough time in the day, that should guests
arrive, who had not yet eaten that day, they would have enough time to
eat and enjoy the food that was prepared on Yom Tov before the onset
of twilight. But if there is not enough time (left in the day) to enjoy the
benefit of the labor, the eiruv tavshilin is not effective. Therefore, it is
customary, when Yom Tov occurs on Friday, to begin Maariv prayers
Friday night earlier than usual, while it is still daytime, so that people
will hurry to complete all their work before the congregation recites,
Mizmor shir leyom haShabbos. The cooked dishes that you want to keep
warm for Shabbos, should be put in the oven to warm while it is still
broad daylight, so that before twilight, at least one third of the cooking
should be done.




4


You are permitted to bake and to cook by means of an eiruv tavshilin
only on Friday. If Yom Tov occurs on Thursday and Friday, you are
forbidden to cook or bake anything on Thursday for Shabbos.

5

The eiruv must remain in tact until you have prepared all your Shabbos
needs. If the bread (of the eiruv) was lost or eaten, it also does not
matter; and you are allowed even to bake for Shabbos. But if the
cooked food was lost or eaten, if a kazayis is left it doesn't matter. But if
less than a kazayis is left, it is forbidden to cook [for Shabbos,] just as if
you had made no eiruv. What should you do if you made no eiruv? If
you thought of it after the morning (Yom Tov) meal, and in that
community there is no other Jew who made an eiruv, you are
perrmitted to cook only one pot, bake only one loaf of bread, and light
one candle for Shabbos. If you thought of it before cooking the
morning (Yom Tov) meal, you may cook all kinds of foods in a large
pot and leave some over for Shabbos. If there is someone there who
made an eiruv, you should give him as a gift, your flour, meat and all
other ingredients. The one who made the eiruv acquires possession of
these items by lifting them up, and then he may cook and bake for you,
even in your house though you did not make an eiruv.

6

The head of every household is required to make an eiruv tavshilin for
himself. Even a woman who has no husband, if she knows how to make
an eiruv tavshilin, is required to make one for herself. It is forbidden to
rely on the eiruv made by the rabbi of the city. If, because of
unavoidable circumstances, you forgot to make an eiruv tavshilin, or
you made one, but it was lost, then if someone in the city makes an
eiruv, for everyone in the city, (that is, he gives them a share in the





cooked dish and the bread, as is explained in the Shulchan Aruch) you
may rely on such an eiruv. But if you forgot out of laziness, or if you
meant to rely on this eiruv from the start, it is ineffective and you must
conduct yourself, according to the laws laid down in paragraph 5 above.
7

If Yom Tov occurs on Thursday and Friday, and on Thursday you
remember that you did not make an eiruv tavshilin, you may make it
on that day, and recite the berachah. Afterwards you should say, ""If this
day is Holy (Yom Tov), then I do not need to make an eiruv. And if
today is really a weekday, then by means of this eiruv etc."" On Rosh
Hashanah, this cannot be done.
"
"1

Just as it is a mitzvah to honor the Shabbos and delight in it, so it is a
mitzvah to honor all the Yomim Tovim and delight in them, as it is said,
""God's holy and honored"" (day). And with regard to all Yomim Tovim it
is said, ""A holy convocation.""

2

What is meant by honor? As our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said, ""It is
a mitzvah for a man to take a haircut on erev Yom Tov so that he does
not enter the festival looking untidy. It is also a mitzvah to bathe in
warm water, to wash your hair, and to cut your nails on erev Yom Tov,
the same as on erev Shabbos. It is also a mitzvah to bake challos in your
house on erev Yom Tov in honor of Yom Tov, just as it is on erev
Shabbos. It is forbidden to eat on erev Yom Tov after Minchah, just as
on erev Shabbos, so that you will be able to eat the Yom Tov meal with
good appetite. And if erev Yom Tov occurs on Shabbos, you must eat





the third meal before Minchah ketanah. This law also applies to the first
day of Yom Tov, since it is the eve of the second day of Yom Tov.
3

What is meant by delight? As our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said on
each Yom Tov day you must have two meals, one at night and one
during the day, but it is not our custom to have a third meal. You are
obligated to say kiddush over a cup of wine before the meal. You should
say Hamotzi on two whole loaves as you do on Shabbos, and you
should be lavish with meat, wine and sweets, according to your means.

4

On every Yom Tov, at the conclusion of the kiddush at night we say the
berachah of Shehecheyanu on the joy of the holiday, except on the
seventh and eighth nights of Pesach when shehecheyanu is omitted, since
they are not a separate Yom Tov in themselves. When lighting the
candles, women should not say the berachah shehecheyanu on any Yom
Tov. Some women follow the custom of saying shehecheyanu on all
Yomim Tovim (except on the seventh and eighth nights of Pesach), and
we do not protest their practice.

5

Every man is obligated to gladden the hearts of his wife, his children,
and all who are dependent on him, in a way suitable for each. To the
little children you should give nuts and candy, to the women, clothing
and jewelry according to your means, and to the men, meat and wine.
It is the custom to serve a greater variety of foods on Yom Tov than on
Shabbos, because with regard to Yom Tov, the Torah mentions
""rejoicing,"" but it is not mentioned with regard to Shabbos. Also Yom
Tov clothes should be more expensive than Shabbos clothes.




6


On the second day of Pesach, you should add an extra dish to the meal
to remember the feast of Esther which took place on this day, for it was
on this day that Haman was hanged.

7

On the first day of Shavuos it is customary to eat dairy foods. There are
several reasons for this. A hint of this custom is found in the words,
Minchah chadashah LaShem beshavuoseichem. The initials of these words
spell meichalav—""of milk."" You should also eat foods with honey,
because the Torah is compared to milk and honey, as it is said, ""Honey
and milk are under your tongue."" Now, since we eat dairy foods and we
must also eat meat, because it is a mitzvah to eat meat on every Yom
Tov, care must be taken not to violate the law of mixing the dairy and
meat foods.

8

Even though eating and drinking on festivals is a positive
commandment, you should not spend all day eating and drinking,
because it is said, ""(A day of ) restraint (in honor) of Adonoy, your
God."" Even though it is said, ""(A day of ) restraint it shall be for you,""
our Rabbis, of blessed memory, explained: The day should be divided,
half devoted to Hashem and half to yourself. Therefore, it is your duty
to engage also in the study of Torah.

9

And when you eat and drink, it is your duty to provide also for the
orphan, the widow and other needy people, as it is said, ""And the
Levite, the proselyte, and the orphan etc…."" (Deuteronomy 16:14). He
who locks the doors of his courtyard, and eats and drinks with his wife
and children and does not give food and drink to the poor and
unhappy souls, is not rejoicing in a mitzvah, but rejoicing in his





gluttony. Concerning such people it is said, ""Their sacrifices will be to
them like the bread of mourners; all who eat of them will be unclean;
for their bread will be for their souls."" And such rejoicing is a disgrace
for them as it is said, ""I will spread dung on your faces, the dung of
your festival offerings.""
10

When a person eats and drinks, and rejoices on the festival, he should
not overindulge in drinking wine, in laughter and lightheadedness,
thinking that the more he indulges, the greater will be the mitzvah of
rejoicing. For drunkenness, mockery and lightheadedness is not
rejoicing, but licentiousness and foolishness. And we were not
commanded to act licentiously and foolishly, but to rejoice in the
service of the Creator of all things, as it is said, ""Because you did not
serve Adonoy, your God, with happiness and a glad heart, when you
had plenty of everything."" From this we infer that the service of God
must be done with joy, but you cannot serve God in frivolity, or
lightheadness or in drunkenness.

11

It is the way of the pious, who constantly have God before them, and
who are mindful of Him in all their ways, when they rejoice, to greatly
bless and praise the Holy One Blessed is He Who enabled them to
rejoice. A man should say to himself at the time of his rejoicing and
pleasure, ""If the happiness of this world is so great, (a world) which is
vanity because it ends in grief and sorrow, how great will be the eternal
joy of the World to Come which is not followed by grief."" And he
should pray to the Holy One Blessed is He that He bend his heart to
serve Him and to do His will wholeheartedly, and that He should
gladden us with everlasting joy, and make us worthy of the life of the





World to Come, to be enlightened by the light of the presence of the
Living King.
12

Every man is obligated to prevent the members of his household from
congregating in places which, Heaven forbid, could lead to levity,
through association with lightheaded people. They should be
encouraged to be holy because the day is holy.

13

At the conclusion of a Yom Tov that is followed by a weekday or Chol
Hamoed, Atah chonantanu is said in the Shemoneh Esrei, and Havdalah
is said over a cup [of wine.] However, the berachah is not said over the
candle, or over the spices.

14

It is customary to eat and drink a bit more lavishly [than usual] on the
day after all three festivals. That day is called Isru chag, and it is
customary not to fast on that day. Even a groom and bride on their
wedding day [do not fast], and a person observing yahrzeit [should also
not fast on Isru chag]. On Isru chag following Shavuos, even according
to halachah, it is forbidden to fast, because when the Beis Hamikdash
was in existence, if Shavuos occurred on Shabbos, the sacrifices were
offered on the following day. But on Pesach and Sukkos, they were
offered on the first day of Chol Hamoed.
"
"1

On Chol Hamoed it is forbidden to do certain melachos, while others are
permitted, namely, all work that is necessary for the preparation of food
for Chol Hamoed or Yom Tov. Any melachah that is done to prevent a
loss, that is, if by not doing it you will incur a loss, may be done. But





you should be very careful not to do any melachah that is forbidden on
Chol Hamoed because our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said: ""He who
desecrates Chol Hamoed is considered as though he worshipped idols.""
2

In addition, our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said: ""He who disgraces
Chol Hamoed, even though he has to his credit Torah and good deeds,
has no share in the World to Come."" Disgracing Chol Hamoed implies
not honoring it with better food and wearing better clothes. Therefore,
every man is obligated to honor it according to his means, and to wear
dignified clothing.

3

Work, which, if not done, would result in a loss, may be done even by
another Jew, even for payment. But, if no loss would result, but the
work is needed for the festival, it should not be done by another Jew for
pay, but by a non-Jew. And if you cannot find a non-Jew, and you are
unable to do it yourself, it is permitted to have it done, even by a Jew
for pay.

4

The law that permits melachah in order to prevent a loss, applies only if
it was impossible for you to do it before Yom Tov, but if it was possible
for you to do it before Yom Tov, and you left it for Chol Hamoed, you
are forbidden to do it on Chol Hamoed.

5

Any work that is forbidden on Chol Hamoed, [is permitted in the
following circumstances,] if a Jew does not have enough food for Chol
Hamoed and Yom Tov, it is permitted to give him work, so that he will
have something to eat, but he should do it in private. It is forbidden to
have such work done by a non-Jew, but if it is needed for a mitzvah, it
is permitted.




6


Even melachos that are permitted, are forbidden to be done for a nonJew.

7

It is forbidden to fertilize a field. Even to put sheep in a field to fertilize
it with manure is forbidden. Even to have it done by a non-Jew is
forbidden.

8

Planting is forbidden. However if you have seeds that will spoil
completely, unless they are put into water, you are permitted to water
[soak] them.

9

It is forbidden to pluck or cut off anything that is growing, unless the
fruit will spoil [if left] until after Yom Tov. It is permitted to pluck what
you need to eat on Yom Tov, and you do not have to skimp. You may
pick a generous quantity, and if there is some left over, it does not
matter. Also, wood that is needed for heating on the festival, is
permitted to be cut from a growing tree. If it is necessary to pick
something in order to feed your animals, it should be done in an
irregular way. It is forbidden to collect wood from a field in order to
improve it for plowing. But if it is obvious that you intend it for your
own need, because you need the wood, for example, if you take the big
pieces and leave the small ones, it is permissible. Similarly, it is
forbidden to cut off the (soft) branches of a tree in order to trim it. But
if it is obvious that your purpose is to feed the branches to your
animals, and not to trim the tree, for example, if you cut all the
branches from one side of the tree, it is permitted.

10

If you have a garden adjacent to a garden of a non-Jew, and the nonJew is gathering his fruit, and if you do not gather (your fruit), you will





incur a loss, you are permitted to gather them. And if they are fruits
that will spoil when they are picked, unless you do additional melachah,
you are permitted to do everything [that is necessary] even to press
grapes to make wine or similar melachos, provided you did not
intentionally leave this work to be done on Chol Hamoed.
11

It is forbidden to shave on Chol Hamoed, even if you shaved on erev
Yom Tov. But a person who has been released from jail, even if he was
released erev Yom Tov, but had no time to shave then, is permitted to
shave on Chol Hamoed.

12

Cutting your nails is also forbidden, but if you cut them on erev Yom
Tov, you are permitted to cut them also on Chol Hamoed. A woman is
also permitted (to cut her nails) for the ritual immersion.

13

It is forbidden to launder anything, even (clothes) needed for the
festivals, unless it was impossible to wash them before Yom Tov. Since
(babies) urinate all the time, and you need many diapers, you are
permitted to wash them, but you should be careful to wash them in
privacy.

14

Anything required to restore health, is permitted to be done, either for
man or beast.

15

It is permitted to record bills and similar records which, if not recorded
will be forgotten because it is considered prevention of a loss. You are
permitted to write whatever is necessary for the needs of Yom Tov, but
it is forbidden to write anything else. Social letters that friends write to
each other, should be written with a slight change, like writing the first





line unevenly. For everything that you are permitted to write, you are
also permitted to prepare a pen and ink.
16

A person who needs money, even if not for Yom Tov needs, and is
afraid that he might not get a loan after Yom Tov, and the lender refuses
to give a loan without receiving a note, is permitted to write such a
note.

17

Weddings are not performed on Chol Hamoed because one kind of
rejoicing should not be mixed with another. But one is permitted to
remarry the woman he divorced. It is permitted to make a feast for a
circumcision, or the redemption of a firstborn. It is also permitted to
make a feast for an engagement.

18

It is permitted to hire workers, even Jews, to do work for you after Yom
Tov.

19

You are permitted to go outside the techum, either on foot or in a
vehicle, or on horseback.

20

It is not permitted to mate a male animal with a female animal, because
no loss is sustained [by delaying it]

21

You are not allowed to set a chicken on eggs to hatch them. If you set
her before the festival and she ran away, if it is within three days from
the time she ran away, you are permitted to put her back, but after
three days, you are forbidden to put her back, even if the eggs will be
spoiled. And to set another in her place, even within three days is
forbidden.




"
"1

It is forbidden to move and carry movable belongings and household
utensils on Chol Hamoed, from an apartment in one courtyard to an
apartment in another courtyard, even from an unattractive apartment
to a nice one. But to move these items from one house to another in
the same courtyard, is permitted. Similarly, if the two courtyards are
adjacent to each other, and there is a door between them, it is permitted
to take things out through that door. However, if you would otherwise
incur a loss, you are permitted to move these articles even from one city
to another. Moving from a house that doesn't belong to you to your
own house, is permitted, for this is considered rejoicing on Yom Tov,
because it is a joy to live in your own home.

2

If you must take in fruit, or other merchandise because you fear it will
be stolen, or damaged, it should be done in a secluded manner if
possible. If you cannot do it in a secluded manner, you are permitted to
do it openly.
"
"1

All commerce is forbidden, whether buying or selling. However if you
have an opportunity to make a big profit, you may buy and sell in
private. You should then spend more in honor of Yom Tov than you
had previously intended.

2

If you have merchandise and you are afraid that if you don't sell it now,
its value will become less than its cost, you are permitted to sell it,





because you prevent a loss thereby. However, if there is no fear of
sustaining a loss, except that you will not make a profit later, you are
forbidden to sell it, because unearned profit is not considered a loss.
3

If a fair occurs on (Chol Hamoed), that is, a market day which occurs
infrequently, or even the weekly market day, which occurs before the
non-Jewish holidays, when many buyers come together, you are
permitted to sell in that market. Since it is an irregular occasion, even a
lack of profit is considered a loss. But to sell in a regular weekly market
is forbidden. Merchants or ships that arrive occasionally, and sell
merchandise cheaply, or buy at a high price, which is something that
does not happen often, you are then also permitted to buy from them
and sell to them.

4

If you need to purchase wine at the time of vintage, for the needs of
your household for the entire year, because later the price of wine will
go up, you are allowed to buy it on Chol Hamoed, but it is forbidden to
buy it for business purposes.

5

Things that are needed for the Yom Tov, like fruits and spices, may be
sold regularly, even openly. And since you are allowed to open your
store to sell to a Jewish customer, you may also sell to a non-Jewish
customer.

6

It is customary to be lenient about collecting debts, even when the debt
is owed by a Jew, because we consider this the prevention of a loss.

7

Lending money on interest to a regular non-Jewish customer is
permitted, because it would be a loss, if he took his business elsewhere.
If you lend money to a non-Jew, who is not your regular customer, you





should spend the interest of one week for [the mitzvah of ] rejoicing on
Yom Tov. Selling merchandise to someone who is not a regular
customer is forbidden, and it is of no avail even if you spend more of
your profits for [the mitzvah of ] rejoicing on Yom Tov. But you are
permitted to sell to a regular customer, because it is considered
prevention of a loss, so that he will not get accustomed to purchase
elsewhere.
8

It is forbidden to exchange money (on Chol Hamoed).
"
"1

During the entire month of Nisan we do not say Tachanun or Tzidduk
Hadin (burial service), and we do not say Tzidkasecha on Shabbos at
Minchah. It is customary from Rosh Chodesh on, to read (from the Seifer
Torah) the parashah of the Nasi who brought his offering on that day.
On the thirteenth day of the month, we read in parashas Beha'alosechah
until ""Kein asah es hamenorah"" ""So did he make the Menorah"" which is
fitting for the tribe of Levi.

2

[During the month of Nisan,] we do not fast even the fast of a Yahrzeit,
but we may fast because of a dream. The firstborn (males) fast on erev
Pesach, as will be explained, God willing, in Chapter 113. A groom and
a bride also fast during Nisan, even on Rosh Chodesh Nisan.

3

On Shabbos Hagadol at Minchah it is customary not to recite Barchi
Nafshi, but to say instead Avadim Hayinu etc., because on Shabbos
Hagadol the redemption from Egypt and the miracles began.




"
"1

It is written, ""And you must guard the matzos"" (Exodus 12:17 ). From
this we learn that we must guard the wheat [from which we make] the
matzos with which we perform the mitzvah, to see that no water comes
upon them. According to some of the great halachic authorities, of
blessed memory, this watchfulness is to begin from the time the wheat
is harvested. The prevailing custom is to follow the opinion of the
authorities, who maintain it is sufficient to guard it from the time it is
brought to the mill, and thereafter. However, people who are
meticulous in their performance of mitzvos, are concerned that [the
wheat] should be guarded from the time it is harvested, and this is the
proper thing to do. Special care must be taken that the stalks do not
remain attached to the earth until they completely dry out and turn
white, because then if rain falls on them they will become chametz, even
though they are still attached to the soil, since they no longer need the
soil's (nourishment). It is, therefore, fitting and proper to harvest them
when they are still slightly green. If you can obtain wheat that was
guarded from the time of harvesting for all the days of Yom Tov, so
much the better. If this is impossible, you should at least be scrupulous
about this for the matzos of both Seder nights.

2

If in some of the wheat there was found kernels that were split open or
sprouted; the rest may be used for matzah, provided the unfit ones were
separated or carefully measured to make sure that there is at least sixty
times as much (of the good wheat) as the split and sprouted (wheat).
Initially, you should be scrupulous to sort out even wheat from which
mice have eaten, or to make sure that there is at least sixty times as





much of the good wheat. Wheat that arrived by ship or was stored in
pits, if it is dry and hard, and its color has not changed, is kosher for
Pesach. If it was stored in an attic and rain dripped upon it in several
places, through the roof, it is forbidden. But if a little snow fell on it or
a little water, in one place only, you must remove those kernels which
are doubtful, and the rest may be used.
3

It is a long established custom in Yisroel, in preparing the mill, to clean
it thoroughly, and scrub it in every possible way and to purchase new
bags [for the flour.] In a community where there are Torah scholars,
they should go to the mill to supervise the cleansing, and to see that the
preparations are done properly. In a community where there are no
Torah scholars, every God-fearing person should go himself to supervise
the preparation of the mill, for it is a greater mitzvah to do it yourself,
than if an agent does it for you. It is customary that the first flour
milled after this preparation, is not eaten on Pesach. If moist grain is
also ground at that mill, it should be separated with a partition, so that
none of its powder should mix with it.

4

If a bag of flour has become wet, if only one part became wet, whether
it is still moist or already dry, you may take that part in your hand
while you empty the rest of the flour, which you are permitted to use.
Only the part that has become wet is forbidden. However, if the bag of
flour has become wet in several places so that it is impossible to take
these steps, then, if it is still moist, the flour is sifted and only the pieces
that remain in the sieve are chametz, but the rest may be used. If mice
have eaten some of the flour, it should be sifted. However, if the bag of
flour has become dry, sifting is of no use, and the entire flour is
forbidden to be used.




5


On the day the flour has been ground it is forbidden to be baked,
because the flour is then warm and will quickly become chametz when
water is poured on it. Therefore, you should postpone using it for at
least twenty-four hours after the grinding.

6

The bags for holding the flour preferably should be made new, or at
least the seams of the old bags should be opened, and they should be
washed thoroughly with warm water and ashes, and by rubbing and
beating them.

7

It is forbidden to load a bag of flour on an animal, unless thick leather
is placed underneath the bag, as otherwise, it will get warm and moist
from perspiration. If possible, you should also be careful not to place
many bags one on top of the other, because as a result of that, the flour
will be heated, and become chametz in the kneading.
"
"1

The flour for the matzos should be kneaded only with water that has
stayed overnight, that is to say, it should be drawn during twilight, and
left standing overnight. Even if the night is longer than twelve hours, it
is forbidden to use it for kneading until daylight, and if the night is
short and there are no twelve hours until daylight, we must wait until
twelve hours will have passed from the time it has been drawn.
Ordinary people are accustomed to begin kneading as soon as it grows
light, with water that stayed overnight, even though, as yet twelve hours
have not passed. Although there are some authorities who permit this,





most of the authorities take the more stringent view. It is necessary,
therefore, to be watchful in this matter.
2

If you are unable to estimate the exact time of twilight, you may draw
water a little earlier, provided you do not draw it before sunset. It is the
custom to strain the water and to cover it, and it must be placed in a
cool place. When bringing the water into the house in the morning,
you must be careful to keep it out of the sun.

3

You are permitted to draw enough water at one time to last for several
days, but the proper way of fulfilling the mitzvah is to draw water daily
for the needs of that day. It is the custom not to draw water in an old
earthen vessel, even though it is used only for Pesach, unless it is glazed,
for the use of an old unglazed vessel cannot be considered an
enhancement of the mitzvah. This custom should not be changed.

4

Rivers in the month of Nissan are generally cooler than wells. You
should, therefore, draw water from a river. Sometimes, however, the
rivers are swollen from the melting snow and the water is not so cold; it
is then preferable to draw water from a well.

5

The water should not be drawn by a non-Jew, but by a Jew.

6

You should not put the water in a vessel that has contained honey or
fruit juice, unless it has been kashered with boiling water. You surely
should avoid placing the water into a vessel that had contained food
with a sharp taste, even if it was not chametz, because on account of the
sharpness, the dough will rise faster, and even kashering with boiling
water will be of no use in such a case. Neither should you put the water
into a copper vessel, because it does not keep it as cool as other vessels.




7


If you notice that the water kept overnight is not sufficient, you may
add other water, provided most of the water is that which stayed
overnight. Initially, it is best that two thirds of the total should consist
of the water that stayed overnight. If possible, try to draw the added
water from a pump or a covered well, where the sun does not reach.

8

If the matzah is baked on Sunday, the water must be drawn on
Thursday evening, because on Friday it is impossible to fix the exact
time of twilight. In an extreme circumstance, if the water was not
drawn on Thursday, it should be drawn on Friday after the Minchah
service, or on Shabbos by a non-Jew.

9

The water held overnight should not be poured out on account of a
death that has occurred, or on account of the vernal equinox, because it
is said, ""He who keeps the commandment shall know no evil thing""
(Ecclesiastes 8:5). Nevertheless, if you know that the vernal equinox
will occur, you should put into the water a small, clean piece of metal,
something like a needle attached to a thread, so that afterwards you will
not have to put your hands into the water to get it out, but you will be
able to pull it out by the thread.
"
"1

If you want to bake matzos in an oven in which chametz has been
baked, it must be kashered by heating it until it becomes red hot, that
is, heating it to such a degree that sparks fly from it, for anything less
than that does not constitute true glowing. You should be careful to
spread the coal over the entire area of the oven. The correct thing to do





is to remove the ashes and clean it thoroughly after heating, and wait
until it cools off somewhat; and then make a new fire for baking the
matzos. This should not be done immediately after the heating process.
2

Some people have the custom to plaster the oven with fresh clay to
avoid the necessity of kashering it through heating, for the chametz
absorbed in the roof and walls of the oven is emitted by the heat of the
flame that is lit for the purpose of baking the matzos. It is a good
custom, provided the oven is plastered with a coating of clay, the
thickness of a finger or more, over its entire area. But a thin coating is
of no use.

3

Matzos should be kneaded and prepared only in a house that has a roof,
and not before an open window, even if the sun does not shine through
it. But if the windows are closed and have panes, it is permitted to
knead the matzos, if the sun does not shine through them. But if the
sun shines through them, the glass panes are of no use, but a curtain
must be spread over the windows on the sunny side of the room. Care
must be taken that the house should not be heated and warm.

4

No dough should be kneaded that is larger than the quantity of dough
that is subject to the separation of challah. It is better to make it
smaller, for our Rabbis of blessed memory estimated, that if the dough
is larger than the quantity of dough that is subject to challah, it cannot
be worked at one and the same time; thus part of it will be left
unworked, and there is reason to fear that it may become chametz. If
the dough you are kneading is loose, flour should not be added to
thicken it.




5


When the flour is measured, it should not be stuffed into the
measuring vessel because there is reason to fear that the dough might
not be kneaded well, and particles of flour will be found in the matzah,
and when put into the soup, it will become chametz. Care should be
taken not to put the flour near the water, so that flour dust should not
fall into the water. Similarly, the person who measures the flour should
not go near the dough or the water. It is good to be careful not to
handle the flour needlessly, because the hands will warm it slightly.

6

It should be watched that the vessel used for kneading should not have
any holes or cracks where particles of dough might remain and become
chametz. While kneading, the vessel should not be placed on pillows or
pads, lest it become warm. Care must be taken that every eighteen
minutes the vessel is thoroughly cleaned, and the hands thoroughly
washed. The boards and rolling pins must be carefully inspected to
make sure that they have no holes or cracks. They should be thoroughly
cleaned at least every eighteen minutes. The tools that make the
perforations must also be cleaned of even the smallest particle of dough.
The peel (a shovel-like tool), with which the matzos are put into the
oven, must be carefully inspected for any cracks where a particle of
dough might be caught and become chametz.

7

If anything with a sharp flavor fell into the dough, such as salt, spices or
even if the smallest quantity fresh lime and was kneaded into it, the use
of the entire dough is forbidden, because it has become heated by it. If
a grain of wheat is found in the dough, you should remove from it a
quantity of dough as thick as your finger, all around that grain, and
throw it away; and the rest of the dough may be used.




8


Care must be taken not to leave the dough, even for a moment without
working it. As soon as the dough is completed, it should be divided
into portions and handed to the rollers. Care should be taken,
therefore, to make the dough only as large as can be handled by the
rollers. If some of the dough is left with the person who hands out the
portions, he should keep kneading it so that it should not lie idle even
for a moment.

9

The rollers should do their work at full speed and not waste time on
giving the matzos a specific shape. They should pay close attention that
no particles of the dough are left on the board, and also that no dough
clings to their hands. As soon as they notice any dough sticking to their
hands, they must wash them thoroughly.

10

As soon as the matzah is ready, it should be perforated quickly. They
should not make any design with the perforations, but they should rush
at top speed, and put it into the oven immediately. Great care should be
taken not to hold it even for a moment in front of the opening of the
oven, for it will become chametz quickly. It is necessary, therefore, to
make sure that the person handing the matzos to the baker should be a
Torah scholar, a God-fearing man, who will be meticulously vigilant.

11

A God-fearing person should take care, before baking his matzos, to
have the oven well heated again, and the coals spread over the entire
oven, for who knows if the person who baked matzos before him was
scrupulously careful about it.

12

The baker should be very careful to see to it that none of the matzos are
folded over, and that one matzah does not touch the other, for in the





place where one matzah touches another or where it is folded over it
does not bake quickly and it becomes chametz. In the event that a
matzah is folded over or becomes blown up, it is necessary to break off
and throw away that piece; that piece is chametz, but the rest may be
eaten. However, if the matzos touched each other in the oven while still
moist, they may be eaten, since it is already done. A blown up matzah is
one in which it is evident that the matzah has separated in its thickness,
and the bubble is as wide as a thumb.
13

Care should be taken not to take a matzah out of the oven before it is
slightly baked; that is, if you would break it, there should be no threads
of dough [between the pieces.] Before this stage it is still like dough,
which when taken out of the oven will become chametz very quickly.
The peel with which this matzah was taken out of the oven is forbidden
to be used for baking matzos. If it is impossible to determine whether
or not this matzah, had threads of dough when taken out of the oven,
because of the uncertainty, we are strict. But if the matzah has formed a
crust, we may take a lenient view.

14

Every God-fearing man should personally supervise the preparation and
baking of his own matzos, and urge the workers, to work with speed
and care. This was how it was done by the early, great Sages of Yisrael of
blessed memory, and this is what is done also at the present time.

15

The matzos with which we fulfill the mitzvah of eating matzah on the
first two nights of Pesach are referred to as matzos mitzvah, and they
must be prepared for the sake of the mitzvah by an adult, male Jew of
intelligence, aged at least thirteen years and one day, or a female aged at
least twelve years and one day. At each stage in the preparation the





worker says, leshem matzas mitzvah, [""For the sake of the matzah of the
mitzvah.""] (This should be said) even when drawing the water. (All the
foregoing laws regarding the baking of the matzos refer to our custom
that all matzos are baked before Pesach. In an emergency, when matzos
are baked on Pesach, there are other stringencies in addition to the ones
mentioned above. Those who follow the custom of baking matzos
mitzvah in the afternoon of erev Pesach must take special precautions).
"
"1

On the evening before erev Pesach the search for chametz must be made.
You must make the search immediately after nightfall. It is forbidden to
begin a meal or do any work one half-hour before nightfall.

2

The search should be made with only one wax candle, not with several
candles intertwined, for that would be like a torch. In a predicament
when you have no wax candle, you may use a tallow candle.

3

You must search all rooms in which you suspect that someone carried
chametz, even cellars, attics, stores and woodsheds; any places in which
you think that chametz may have been brought must be searched. You
must also search all vessels in which you keep chametz. Before making
the search, you should carefully sweep all these places and clean all
chametz out of them, in order to make it easy for you to search the
rooms afterwards.

4

A cowshed where the cattle are fed grain, and a chicken coop where the
chickens are fed with grain do not require searching; [first of all,]
because the grain may never have become chametz, and even if it did





become chametz, it is possible that all of it was eaten and nothing was
left. But if the grain you put there was chametz, you then have only one
uncertainty, whether all of it was eaten; we do not rely on this
possibility, and you are required to make a search.
5

You must search everywhere, every nook and cranny, as best as you can.
You must also search the pockets of your garments and those of your
children's garments; for since sometimes chametz gets into them, they
have to be searched. You should shake them thoroughly the next
morning when you burn the chametz.

6

[This is the law concerning] the rooms you sell to a non-Jew together
with the chametz in them. Since the sale is not valid until the morning,
you are obliged to search them in the evening, and you must do so.

7

Before beginning the search you recite the berachah: Baruch ata
Hashem, Elokeinu melech haolam asher kideshanu bemitzvosav vetzivanu
al biur chameitz ""Blessed are you, Hashem, our God, King of the
universe, Who has sanctified us with His commandments, and has
commanded us concerning the removal of chametz."" Even though you
do not yet remove it, you still say the berachah ""concerning the
removal,"" since immediately after the search, you nullify the chametz
that is unknown to you, and this, in effect, is the removal of such
chametz. Do not make any interruption between the berachah and
beginning the search. It is a good thing not to interrupt until the search
is completed, except for things relating to the search. You may search
many houses on the basis of the one berachah you recited.




8


Some people have the custom, before beginning the search, to deposit
small pieces of bread in places where the searcher will find them. They
are fearful, if he finds no chametz, the berachah will have been said in
vain. Needless to say, however, anyone who does not search properly,
but only gathers up these pieces of bread, has not fulfilled the mitzvah
of searching, and his berachah was said in vain.

9

The chametz you leave for food or for sale, should be put away in a safe
place, before making the search. The chametz you find in the search,
which must be burned in the morning, should be put away in a safe
place and tied so that it won't get lost. It should be put it in a place
where you will notice it in the morning, so that you will not forget to
burn it.

10

Immediately after the search, you should nullify the chametz. The
actual nullification takes place in your heart, when you decide in your
heart that you consider all chametz in your possession as non-existent,
as worthless, as compared to dust, as something utterly useless. Our
sages ordained that you should express these thoughts verbally by
declaring kol chamira (all chametz) etc. Anyone who does not
understand it in the Aramaic, should say it in a language he
understands. [The English translation of the Aramaic text is]: ""Any
leaven or chametz that is in my possession, that I have not seen and
have not removed, should be nullified and become ownerless, like the
dust of the earth.""

11

Even though you have already nullified the chametz at night after the
search, nevertheless, in the morning after burning it, you must nullify it





again. In this declaration you include all the chametz, and you say, Kol
chamira—(all chametz) etc., or in a language you understand. [The
English translation of the Aramaic text is:] Any leaven or chametz that
is in my possession whether I have seen it or not, whether I have
removed it or not, should be nullified and become ownerless like the
dust of the earth.""
12

If you have a room that must be searched, that you want to use as a
storage room; that is to say, you want to store, fruit, wood or other
articles, which would make it impossible to search the room on the
night of the fourteenth of Nisan, then you should search that room
before you convert it to a storeroom, making the search at night, in the
same manner as you search for chametz on the night of the fourteenth
of Nisan. [This holds true] even if there is still plenty of time before
Pesach, and even if this is immediately after the Pesach that has just
passed. However, if you did not search the room before turning it into a
storage room, if you intend to remove the stored articles, before the
time of the search will come, you do not have to go to the trouble at
this time to empty the room and search it. But if you intend to remove
the articles during the week of Pesach, you must remove them now and
make the search, even though it involves great trouble and loss of
money.

13

If you fill up a storage room with the intention of not emptying it until
after Pesach, then it depends on the time you fill it up. If you do it more
than thirty days before Pesach, you need not search the room. However
if there is any chametz you know of, you must first remove it. The
declaration of nullification will then effectively nullify all your chametz
at the proper time (erev Pesach). However, if it is within thirty days





before Pesach, you are subject to the laws of searching for chametz
(because we ask questions and explain the laws of Pesach thirty days
before Pesach), thus you must search the room. Even if, inadvertently,
you forgot to make the search, you must empty the storeroom, and
make the search in the night, immediately after you become aware of
your oversight.
14

If you store wheat that has not become chametz, in a pit, but
afterwards, because of the dampness of the pit, the wheat at the bottom
of the pit and at the sides became chametz; then, even if it was stored
there within thirty days, you need not empty the pit on the night of the
fourteenth and search it, rather reciting the nullification is enough,
since it was stored in a permissible manner. If some of the wheat was
chametz (when stored); there are many differing opinions about this,
and in such case you should consult a qualified posek.

15

You should not throw grain to the chickens in a moist place during the
thirty days before Pesach, for you may forget to burn it.

16

Before starting on a trip, you should appoint an agent to search and
nullify your chametz. You should tell him explicitly, that you appoint
him as your agent to make the search and the nullification. When
making the nullification the agent says, ""The chametz of so-and-so etc.""
Nevertheless, wherever you happen to be on the morning of erev Pesach,
you should nullify the chametz on your premises.

17

If you find chametz in your house on Chol Hamoed, you should take it
out and burn it, and if it is the quantity of a kazayis, you should first
say the berachah: Al biur chametz, but if it is less than a kazayis, you do





not say a berachah. If you find the chametz on Yom Tov or on the
Shabbos of Chol Hamoed, or on the Shabbos which occurs on erev
Pesach, when it is forbidden to handle the chametz because it is
muktzeh, you should cover it with a vessel until the conclusion of Yom
Tov, or the conclusion of Shabbos, and then you should burn it. If you
find chametz on the last two days of Pesach, in which case at the
conclusion of Yom Tov, Pesach has already ended, you do not say the
berachah when burning it. You should burn it without saying the
berachah, even though its quantity is as much as a kazayis.
"
"1

Any food that contains a mixture of chametz even if the chametz is not
actually present, but only the taste of the chametz remained after the
chametz itself was removed, is forbidden to be kept during Pesach.
However, if the food never contained chametz but was cooked in a
vessel used for chametz, even if chametz was cooked in the vessel that
day, or if an item was pickled in a vessel used for chametz, you are
permitted to keep it during Pesach, provided it was cooked or pickled
before Pesach; but if the cooking or pickling was done on Pesach in a
vessel used for chametz, the food item must be burned.

2

If grain contains some seeds that have sprouted or were split open, even
if only a few of them were mixed in a large quantity, or if water has
fallen on the grain, or it was washed with water, it is forbidden to keep
(such grain during Pesach), and anything that was prepared from such
grain, is forbidden to be kept during Pesach. If you sell your neighbor
grain that has become wet, you must let him know this, so that he will





not keep it in his possession during Pesach. You are forbidden to sell it
to a non-Jew, when you are concerned that the non-Jew will sell it to a
Jew who will keep it during Pesach.
3

Clothes that were laundered and starched with wheat starch are
permitted to be worn on Pesach, but you should not spread a tablecloth
if there is any starch on it, for there is concern that some particles may
flake off, and most certainly it is forbidden to put the Pesach flour into
such a cloth.

4

You are allowed to paste paper on a window even during the thirty days
before Pesach, provided the chametz is not visible. Since the paste is not
absolute chametz, and it is also covered up, the Sages did not rule
stringently in this case. But, if the paste is visible, it is forbidden. But
before the thirty days, it is permitted in any case.

5

If ink was prepared with beer before Pesach, you are permitted to write
with it on Chol Hamoed Pesach, because it has become unfit even for
dog food before Pesach. The same law applies to all similar cases where
chametz has become spoiled and totally unfit before Pesach. You may
derive benefit from such chametz and keep it on Pesach. But if a nonJew prepared ink with beer on Pesach, a Jew is forbidden to derive
benefit from it, because the chametz belonging to a non-Jew is also
forbidden for a Jew to benefit from on Pesach.

6

All vessels that you are not kashering for Pesach must be scrubbed
thoroughly on erev Pesach before the sixth hour, and rinsed in such a
way that no chametz is visible on them. They should be stored in a





secluded place where you do not ordinarily go on Pesach. It is best to
lock them up in a separate room and to hide the key until after Pesach.
"
"1

On erev Pesach we do not say Mizmor lesodah—""A psalm of
thanksgiving"" (Psalm 100 ), neither do we say Lamenatzei'ach—""For the
Conductor"" (Psalm 20 ).

2

You are permitted to eat chametz only during the first third of the day,
(the day is calculated as extending from dawn until the stars appear).
But you may derive benefit from it for another hour. Thus, you are
permitted to sell it to a non-Jew during that hour, but after that time it
is forbidden to derive any benefit from it. You must burn the chametz
and nullify it while you are still permitted to derive benefit from it.

3

After midday it is forbidden to do any work. However, you are
permitted to do such work as is permitted on Chol Hamoed. But it is
customary to permit a non-Jew [to do work for you.] In some
communities it is the custom to forbid doing work the entire day.

4

You should take a haircut and cut your nails before midday. If you
forget to do so, you may cut your nails in the afternoon, but it is
forbidden to take a haircut, unless it is done by a non-Jew.

5

It is forbidden to eat matzah the entire day. It is forbidden to give
matzah even to small children once they are able to understand the
meaning of the Exodus. However, everyone is permitted to eat food
made of matzah meal, until the beginning of the tenth hour, that is





until the beginning of the final quarter of the day. From that time on it
is forbidden to eat, except when it is necessary, in which case you may
eat some fruit, or a little meat and fish You should be careful not to
overeat, so that you will eat the matzah in the evening with appetite.
6

The firstborn sons either of the father or of the mother must fast on
erev Pesach, even if it occurs on Friday. A firstborn who was born after a
miscarriage must also fast. When the firstborn is a minor, his father
fasts instead of him. Whether firstborn are permitted to eat at a mitzvah
meal depends on the local custom.

7

A firstborn who fasts should say Aneinu in the Shemoneh esre of
Minchah. If there are many firstborn and they pray with the
congregation, none of the firstborn should be the Chazzan, since
Aneinu should not be said loud during the repetition of the Shemoneh
esre, since it is the month of Nisan.

8

People who do the mitzvah meticulously bake the mitzvah-matzos in
the afternoon of erev Pesach, which is the time when the Paschal lamb
was offered. And because at that time chametz is forbidden, it is best to
nullify the crumbs explicitly, by making the following statement: ""All
the crumbs that will fall off during the kneading and preparing, as well
as the dough that will cling to the vessels, I hereby nullify and render
ownerless.""

9

The water with which the vessels are washed should be poured on a
sloping place where there is no stone floor, so that it will be quickly
absorbed in the ground; for by pouring it on level ground, or even in a
sloping place with a stone floor, there is reason to be concerned that the





water will gather in one place and become chametz before it is absorbed
in the ground; thus there will be chametz in your possession.
"
"1

A Jew who has chametz in his possession on Pesach, continually
transgresses the law, ""No chametz must be seen in your possession"" (Ex.
13:7 ) and ""No chametz may be found in your home"" (Ex. 12:19 ).

Benefit of such chametz is forever forbidden, even if he nullified it
before Pesach. Therefore, if you own a great deal of chametz that you
cannot do away with, you must sell it to a non-Jew before Pesach, while
you are still permitted to derive benefit from it. You should not treat
the matter of selling chametz as a routine formality. Rather, it should be
your firm intention to actually sell the chametz to the non-Jew, in a
firm and binding sale. You should not sell it for more than it is worth.
After Pesach you demand from the non-Jew that he pay his debt, and
when he replies that he has no money, you ask of him to resell the
chametz to you (together with the room) for so-and-so-much. You
should not make a mockery out of this matter, rather, it should be
handled in a business-like manner.
2

The chametz sold to the non-Jew, may not remain in the house of the
Jew. If the non-Jew takes the chametz into his own house, so much the
better. But if he cannot take it to his home, then you must rent to him
the room in which the chametz is (stored). You must mention in the bill
of sale the name of the buyer and the amount for which the room was
rented, and that by means of the rental of the room, you are
transferring to him the ownership of the chametz that is contained in it.





You should list all the chametz, stating the price of each item, but you
need not mention their weights and measures. You may simply write
how much you charge per measure. All that is written in the contract
should be discussed orally with the buyer. You should take a deposit
from him, and the balance of the purchase price should be considered
as a loan. All of the above should be written in the contract. You must
also deliver to the buyer the key to the room. If any chametz is in a
vessel that requires tevilah (ritual immersion) when bought from a nonJew, you should not sell it with the vessel, because (if you do sell it),
then, after Pesach, when you buy it back from the non-Jew, you will
have to immerse it again.
3

If, after you sold the chametz, you are afraid that the buyer may damage
it, you are permitted to put an additional lock on the door to protect it;
or, if the buyer wants to deposit the key with the Jew, he may do so.
But it is forbidden for a Jew to put a seal on the chametz.

4

If you are unable to rent the whole room because you need part of it for
your own use, you should make a partition in front of the place where
the chametz is kept, and rent to the non-Jew the space (where the
chametz is kept) up to the partition, and write this in the contract. You
should also state that the buyer has the right of access to enter this place
at will. You should also stipulate, that if this non-Jew, the buyer, wishes
to sell the chametz to another non-Jew during Pesach, or to a Jew, the
day after Pesach, all of these have the right to access there. If a Jew rents
or sells to a non-Jew a room that is accessible only through the premises
of the seller, it must be written in the contract that the non-Jew, the
buyer, and any other buyers that he may bring there, should have the
right to enter there.




5


If the house you live in was rented from another Jew, you cannot rent it
to the non-Jew as a residence without the permission of the landlord.
Therefore, you should expressly tell the non-Jew that you are not
renting it to him as a residence, but only to keep his vessels and
belongings there. You should not rent it with the stipulation that you
are doing so to keep the chametz there, but generally to keep his vessels
and belongings as he sees fit. Nevertheless, if the landlord is in town,
you should obtain his permission to rent it. If you go on a trip before
Pesach, and your wife is going to sell the chametz, you should give her
express permission to rent the room.

6

It is forbidden to stipulate with the non-Jew that after Pesach, he must
sell the chametz back to you, or that you, are obligated to buy it back
from him, but you are permitted to assure him that you will buy it back
from him, and give him some profit.

7

It is forbidden to sell the chametz to an apostate Jewish man or woman,
or to the son of an apostate woman, even if she gave birth to him from
a non-Jew after she became an apostate; for regarding this matter, they
are Jews in the eyes of halachah, and the chametz will be considered as
chametz that was in the possession of a Jew during Pesach, the benefit
of which is forbidden forever.

8

If you own chametz in another place, or en route in wagons or on ships,
you can also sell it [to a non-Jew] by means of selling him a place in
your town. Nevertheless, you should also renounce your ownership to it
before a Rabbinic Court or before three laymen. If the chametz is
delivered to you on Pesach, the non-Jewish buyer should pay the cost of





the wagon and the other expenses. If chametz is delivered to you, which
was shipped by a non-Jew, and you had not ordered it, and knew
nothing about it, the non-Jew should also receive it and pay whatever is
due to the one who brought it. You should have nothing at all to do
with it; on the contrary, you should renounce ownership to it before a
Rabbinical Court or before three laymen.
9

A person owning a mill, whose customers, grind their grain, and pay
their fee in grain, which is chametz, must either sell or lease the mill, to
a non-Jew, before Pesach.

10

Regarding the sale of cattle to a non-Jew, who will feed them chametz,
there are differing opinions among the Sages of blessed memory. If
possible, it is best to avoid selling them, but if it is impossible, it should
be done with advice of a qualified Posek.

11

You are permitted to lend a loaf of bread to another Jew before Pesach,
with the understanding that he should return (a loaf of bread) after
Pesach. In some communities, it is the custom to forbid such loans.

12

If the chametz of a Jew is in the possession of a non-Jew, or conversely,
the chametz of a non-Jew is in the possession of a Jew, you should
consult (a qualified Posek) how to act in this matter, for there are many
differing opinions regarding it.

13

You should be careful, not to benefit after Pesach of the chametz of a
Jew, who is suspected of not having sold it properly.

14

Form of Contract for the Sale of Chametz
I, the undersigned, have sold hereby to the non-Jew (so-and-so) all the

to give it as a gift, or to rent it, without any interference. He also has
the right to move all the above-mentioned into his house; and even if
he leaves them where they are at present, he assumes the responsibility
for everything as of now, and I assume no responsibility whatsoever, not
even the responsibility for accidental loss. I have given the buyer the

manner, according to the law of our holy Torah, and in accordance to
the law of the land.

If erev Pesach occurs on Shabbos, we make the search for chametz on the
eve of the thirteenth of Nisan, that is, on Thursday night. After
concluding the search, you nullify the chametz by saying Kol chamira
etc., as in other years, and on Friday, you burn it, at the same time that





you burn it every erev Pesach, but you do not say Kol chamira. On
Shabbos, after the meal, you nullify it and say Kol Chamira etc.
2

The firstborn fast on Thursday; and if it is difficult for a firstborn to
fast, until after the search for the chametz, he may have a small snack
before making the search, or else, he may appoint someone as his agent
to make the search (and eat a full meal).

3

For this Shabbos, you should not cook dishes made with flour and
grits, because they may stick to the pots, and it is forbidden to clean
them on Shabbos. Therefore, you should cook only dishes that will not
stick (to the pot). After the meal, you should shake the tablecloth well,
and hide it away, together with the vessels used for chametz, in a room,
where you do not usually go on Pesach. If any bread is left over, you
should give it to a non-Jew; but you should be careful not to violate the
law against removing things from one domain to another (see Chapter
82, par. 9 above). The house should be swept, either by a non-Jew, or
with a sweeper that may be used on Shabbos.

4

On Shabbos morning, the Shacharis service should be said at an early
hour, so that there should be enough time to eat a meal with chametz,
while it is still permissible to do so. It is proper to divide the meal into
two parts, that is (after eating one course) recite Birkas Hamazon. Make
a short pause by discussing Torah thoughts or taking a walk, then wash
your hands again, eat and say Birkas Hamazon again. Thereby, you will
have fulfilled the mitzvah of eating three meals on Shabbos.

5

It is customary to read the Haftarah from Malachi 3:4 , Ve'arvah etc.
because it is written there, ""Bring all the tithes into the storehouse etc.""





That is appropriate for the day, for (according to some authorities), the
time at which all tithes had to be removed from the house was on erev
Pesach of the fourth year of the Shemitah cycle, and on erev Pesach of
the seventh year of the Shemitah cycle. All the tithes which were
separated from your grain during the three years, and which were kept
in your house, had to be given to the Levi at the above-mentioned
times.
6

On this Friday, every man should be very careful to ask whether challah
has been separated from the challah loaves that were baked in honor of
Shabbos, for if challah has not been separated, and you become aware
of that on Shabbos, there is a great deal of confusion as to what should
be done; because it is forbidden to separate challah on Shabbos, and it
is also forbidden to keep the challah loaves because of Pesach. The
Magein Avraham contends that all the loaves must be given to a nonJew as an outright gift, before the time that their benefit is forbidden.
Other authorities disagree and offer different solutions, but they all
involve serious problems. Therefore, you must be careful about this.
"
"1

Vessels made from earthenware that were used for chametz cannot be
kashered by immersion in boiling water, nor by heating with charcoal or
blow torch. Ovens and stoves made of stone and bricks can be kashered
by heating with charcoal (or a blow torch) (see above Chapter 110, par.
1 and 2). It is customary not to Kasher stoves used for heating the house
during the winter. If you want to place any kind of a dish on the stove,
during Pesach, you must first put a metal plate on the stove and then





place the dish on it. This method may be used also with an oven made
of tiles.
2

Vessels made of wood, metal, stoneware or bone, can be kashered by
immersing them in boiling water. But vessels that will be damaged by
boiling water, such as vessels that are glued together, even if only the
handle is glued on, cannot be kashered by immersion in boiling water,
because we are concerned that they will not be kashered properly.

3

Before kashering a vessel, you must clean it thoroughly to remove any
rust, or similar residue, making it perfectly clean; but rust stains do not
matter. If the vessel has dents, they should be scraped carefully (with
steel wool etc.). If it is made of metal, you should place hot charcoal on
the dents (or use a blow torch) to ""glow"" them, and then kasher the
vessel with boiling water. If it is impossible to thoroughly clean the
dents and the cracks, and if it is also impossible to ""glow"" them, then
the vessel cannot be kashered. Therefore, knives with handles must be
carefully examined to determine whether they can be kashered. The best
way to do the mitzvah, if you can afford it, is to buy new knives for
Pesach.

4

Vessels that are used over fire (or heat), without water, require glowing.
Therefore, baking and frying pans, in which chametz was baked, require
glowing. Initially, the vessel must be heated so intensely, that it shoots
off sparks. A wooden peel cannot be kashered.

5

If a vessel has a patch, and there is reason to suspect that underneath
the patch, some chametz may have become trapped, that place must
first be glowed until you are certain, that if there was a trace of chametz,





it was burned; and then it should be kashered in boiling water. But if
there is no reason to suspect that a trace of chametz was trapped there,
then, if the patch was put on before the vessel was used for chametz,
you may kasher it as is, because, just as the vessel absorbed the chametz,
so it will expel it with the boiling water (used in the kashering).
However, if the vessel was first used for chametz, and the patch was put
on afterwards, then the kashering has no effect on the place underneath
the patch, and in this case, too, before kashering, you must place hot
charcoal on the patch, to glow that spot. If the patch was soldered with
lead, silver, or similar solder, it may be kashered as is, since the chametz
that has been absorbed, was burned by soldering.
6

A mortar, which is ordinarily used for pounding sharp tasting spices
together with chametz, requires libun kal —""simple glowing"", that is, it
should be filled with burning charcoal, until it is hot enough to burn a
piece of straw placed on the outside of the vessel. But in a community,
where it is customary to pound in it, only pepper and similar spices,
kashering with boiling water is sufficient.

7

In vessels that were used to age whiskey, the taste and aroma of the
whiskey is not eliminated by kashering with boiling water. Only if you
first boil them thoroughly in water and ashes, until the aroma has
disappeared completely, can they then be kashered in boiling water.

8

The kashering of a barrel, should be done as follows: place heated stones
in it, and pour boiling water on them out of the vessel, in which the
water was boiled; then roll the barrel, so that the hot water will reach
every part of it. The type of barrels which we use, are made of many





planks hooped together and if they contained chametz, such as whiskey,
or if flour, kashering is of no avail.
9

When a vessel requires kashering with boiling water, merely scouring
the surface is of no avail, it must be immersed in boiling water.

10

Kashering is of no avail regarding vessels that cannot be thoroughly
cleaned, such as a sieve, the receptacle of a grinder, baskets used for
keeping chametz, a grater, as well as any vessel that has a narrow
opening, which is impossible to clean on the inside, (or a vessel) that
has a spout.

11

A cabinet, in which food is kept the entire year, and soup is sometimes
spilled there from the pots, requires simple kashering, that is pouring
boiling water on it; but it must be poured out of the vessel, in which
the water was boiled. The water should not be thrown, but it should be
poured in a steady stream. (As for kashering) tables, it is also customary
to place glowing hot stones on the table, and pour boiling water on
them, and then to move the stones from place to place in such a
manner, that the boiling water covers the entire surface. The table must
be scrubbed first, and after twenty-four hours, it should be kashered, in
the manner described above. Nevertheless, some people are
accustomed, not to use tables and chests even after kashering, without
covering them with a cloth or something else.

12

Handles of vessels also require kashering. However, if the handle does
not fit into the kashering pot, you should kasher the handle, by pouring
boiling water on it.




13


Vessels used for drinking or measuring, also require kashering. As for
glassware, it is the custom in these regions not to kasher them. Vessels
made of metal, glazed on the inside, cannot be kashered by immersion
in boiling water; but ""simple glowing"" is sufficient, just as with a
mortar, see par. 6.

14

Only water should be used for kashering, and nothing should be mixed
with it, not even ashes or similar substances. If you kashered many
vessels in one kashering kettle, so that the water became thick and filmy
like soup, you should not continue to kasher with it.

15

If you kasher, using a pair of tongs, to hold the vessel, you should relax
your hold on the vessel, and then grip it firmly again; otherwise, the
kashering water would not reach the spot held by the tongs. It is better
to put the vessel in a net or in a basket. You should not put many
vessels at one time into the kettle in which you kasher, so that they
should not touch each other; otherwise, the place where they touch,
would not be kashered.

16

You should not kasher a vessel that has been used the same day, that is,
unless twenty-four hours have passed, since chametz was cooked in it.
Likewise, the kettle, in which the kashering is done, should not have
been used that same day. You should pay attention that the water is still
bubbling when you put a vessel in the kettle. If the kettle, itself, has to
be kashered, then, when the water is boiling, it must be full and you
should throw glowing stones into it, so that the boiling water will
overflow its rim. On erev Pesach, kashering must be done, only until
midday.





17

It is customary, after kashering, to rinse the vessels with cold water.

18

If possible, the kashering should be done in the presence of a Torah
scholar, who is well versed in the laws of kashering.
"
"1

If you find any chametz in food on erev Pesach, anytime before nightfall,
it is like any other forbidden substance, which is nullified if it becomes
mixed (into a permitted subtance), sixty times its volume. Therefore, if
you find a grain of seed in poultry or in cooked food, you should throw
away the seed, and you may eat the rest, even on Pesach. But during
Pesach, itself, even the smallest bit of chametz makes food forbidden (to
eat) and to derive benefit from it. Thus, wherever you find a seed of the
five species of grain, or a small particle of chametz, you should consult a
competent Posek.

2

If grain seeds are found in a water well, you should not use this water,
except in case of urgent need, for example, if no other water is available.
But if you find a piece of bread in the well, the water is forbidden to be
used, even if no other water is available and even filtering is of no use.

3

It is the custom not to singe poultry with straw bearing ears of grain,
for we are concerned that one of the seeds may be chametz. We,
therefore, singe poultry with grass, or we cut the ears off of the straw.
But, if inadvertently, (the poultry was singed with straw bearing ears of
grain), the poultry may be used. You should take care to remove the
crop from the poultry, before you singe it.




4


All kinds of legumes are forbidden; and all kinds of dried fruit are
forbidden, unless it is known that they have been dried in a proper way
on planks, or in a stove that has been made kosher for Pesach (see above
110: 1 and 2). Even dried figs and raisins, whether large or small, are
forbidden to be used; orange peels are also forbidden. Nevertheless, the
beverage prepared from raisins, is customarily permitted to drink. It is
the custom not to put cloves or saffron into food because they are
suspect of containing chametz. Even in our regions, where saffron is
raised in gardens, it is forbidden, in order not to make an exception (to
the law). There are spices, including salt, that are not suspect of
containing chametz. However, before putting them into the food, you
should examine them to see whether there are any grain seeds in them.

5

You should only eat honey, that has not been removed from the comb,
or honey, that has been taken out of the comb by a Jew, to be used
specifically for Pesach.

6

In case of great urgency, for example, when it is needed for a sick or
elderly person, it is permissible to bake matzos with eggs, fruit juice,
milk, wine, or similar beverage, and this is called matzah ashirah (rich
matzah). Care should be taken, however, not to mix any water with it.
However on the first two nights of Pesach, actual matzah must be eaten;
you have not fulfilled your duty, if you eat matzah ashirah. If there is no
urgent need, it is forbidden to bake matzah ashirah, even before Pesach,
to be used on Pesach.

7

If you feed grain or meal to fowl, you should be careful to put it in a
dry place, so that it should not become wet. But it is forbidden to feed





meal to cattle, since it becomes wet from their saliva; and when feeding
them grain, you should be careful to give them a little at a time, so that
no wet grain is left over. If there is any grain left over, you must clear it
away immediately.
8

On erev Pesach, from the time chametz is forbidden, as well as during
the entire week of Pesach, it is forbidden to derive any benefit, even
from chametz belonging to a non-Jew. A Jew is, therefore, forbidden to
haul or to guard chametz, belonging to a non-Jew. It goes without
saying, that a Jew is forbidden to buy chametz for a non-Jew, even with
the money belonging to the non-Jew.

9

During Pesach, it is forbidden to rent an animal to a non-Jew for the
purpose of carrying chametz to him, or to rent him a room for the
purpose of storing chametz in it, because it is forbidden to make profit
from things, from which you are forbidden to benefit. But you are
permitted to rent him an animal for the week of Pesach (except for
Shabbos and Yom Tov), for an unspecified purpose, as when the nonJew does not expressly state that he needs the animal to haul chametz.
Even if you know that the non-Jew will use it to haul chametz, it does
not matter, because, even if the non-Jew hauls nothing with the animal,
he will still have to pay you the full amount of the rental fee.
Consequently, you do not profit at all from (the hauling of ) the
chametz. It is also permitted to rent him a room to live in on Pesach,
even though you know, that he will bring chametz there; nevertheless,
you do not receive payment for letting him bring in chametz; rather
only rent for the room, for, even if he brought in no chametz, you
would not reduce his rent.




10


You are forbidden to entrust, your animal to a non-Jew even a long
time before Pesach, if you know that he will feed it chametz on Pesach.

11

You are permitted to say to your non-Jewish servant, even at a time,
when it is forbidden to derive benefit from chametz, ""Here is money,
buy yourself some food and eat,"" even if you know that he will buy
chametz. If it is urgent, you are also allowed to say, ""Go and eat at the
non-Jew's place, and I will pay him for it."" Or you may say to another
non-Jew, ""Give my servant something to eat, and I will pay you for it.""
But you are forbidden to pay in advance for the food he will give your
servant.

12

If it is necessary to feed chametz to a baby, he should be carried to the
house of a non-Jew. The non-Jew should feed him the chametz and the
Jew should pay him afterwards, but the Jew, himself, should not feed
chametz to the baby. But if the baby's life is threatened, of course,
everything is permitted, (as I have written in Ch. 92 and in Ch. 192
below).

13

Some authorities forbid drinking the milk of a cow, belonging to a nonJew, that is fed chametz on Pesach, while others permit it. The
scrupulous should follow the stricter opinion. Certainly in a
community, where it is the custom to forbid it, God forbid, that
anyone should permit it.
"
"1

You should do your best to obtain choice wine to perform the mitzvah
of drinking the Four Cups. If red wine is available, that is, of the same





quality as white wine, and its kashrus is as reliable as white wine, the red
wine is preferred for the Four Cups, for it is said, ""Look not after wine
when it is red,"" (Proverbs 23:31 ) indicating that wine is most desirable,
when it is red. In addition, because it reminds us of the blood, which
flowed, when Pharaoh slaughtered innocent Jewish children. In
backward and ignorant countries, where people, make slanderous
accusations, Jews refrain from using red wine on Pesach.
2

For the first dipping, which is called karpas, many people follow the
custom of using parsley, but it is better to use celery, which tastes good
when raw. Best of all is to use radishes.

3

For maror (bitter herbs), it is customary to use horseradish, which, may
be grated, because it is very sharp; but you should take care that it does
not lose its strength completely. It should be grated, when you return
home from the synagogue. (see Ch. 98:3 that the grating should be in
an unusual manner). On Shabbos, it is forbidden to grate the maror,
but you should grate it before night, and keep it covered until nightfall.
However, it is preferable to use chazeres, lettuce, which is easier to eat,
and it is called maror, because when it stays in the ground for a long
time, the stem becomes bitter. You can also fulfill the mitzvah with
la'anah, (an herb called wormwood). (Alashin and charchevina
[mentioned in the Mishnah], are not found in our region). All the
species, with which you can fulfill the mitzvah (of eating maror), may
be combined to make up a kazayis, and you may fulfill your duty with
either the leaves or the stems, but not with the roots, that is not with
the little roots, that branch out in all directions. But the large root, out
of which the leaves grow, although it is hidden in the ground, is
considered a stem. Nevertheless, it is better to use the leaves and the





stem that is out of the ground, because some authorities hold that the
part that grows in the ground is called ""root."" The leaves are valid only
if they are fresh, but the stems are valid whether they are fresh or dried
out, but not when they are cooked or pickled.
4

The charoses must have a thick consistency to recall the mortar from
which our forefathers had to make bricks. When you are ready to dip
the maror into it, you should add a little wine or vinegar to make it soft
to represent the blood, and for the additional reason that it should
become fit to dip something into it. The charoses should be made from
fruits that symbolize the Jewish people; for example: figs, for it is said,
""The fig tree has produced its green figs,"" (Song of Songs 2:13 ); nuts,
because it is said, ""I went down to the garden of nuts"" (ibid. 6:11);
dates, because it is said, ""I will ascend the palm tree"" (ibid. 7:9);
pomegranates, because it is said, ""Like a slice of pomegranate"" (ibid.
6:7); apples, to commemorate what is written, ""Beneath the apple tree I
aroused you,"" (ibid. 8:5) where the women gave birth to their children
without pain; and almonds, (shekeidim, singular shakeid), because the
Holy One, blessed is He, watched diligently (shakad) to end our
bondage. You should put spices in it, that look like straw, such as
cinnamon and ginger, that are not finely ground, and have straw-like
strands in them, to recall the straw, the Jews used to knead into the
mortar. On Shabbos, you should not pour the wine and the vinegar
into the charoses, for it must be done in an unusual manner, by putting
the charoses into the wine or the vinegar. The salt water, (even when
Yom Tov does not occur on Shabbos) should be prepared on erev Yom
Tov). If you do prepare it on Yom Tov, you should do it in an unusual
way, by pouring the water first, and adding the salt later.




5


After the Beis Hamikdash was destroyed, the Sages ordained that there
should be two cooked foods on the table, during the reciting of the
Haggadah, one to recall the Korban Pesach, (Passover sacrifice), the
other to recall the Korban Chagigah (Festival sacrifice), which were
offered in the times when the Beis Hamikdash was standing. It is
customary that one of the foods should be meat, from the shoulder
section, to recall that the Holy One, blessed is He, redeemed Yisrael,
with an outstretched arm. It should be roasted on fire, to recall the
Korban Pesach (Passover sacrifice), which was roasted on fire. The
second food should be an egg, because an egg, in the Aramean language
is beiah, that is to say, the Merciful One desired (ba'ei) to redeem us
with an outstretched arm. You may prepare the egg, either roasted or
boiled, but you must do the roasting or boiling on erev Yom Tov, while
it is still daylight. If you forgot to do it (on erev Yom Tov), or if that day
occurred on Shabbos, you should roast or boil it at night, but then you
must eat it on the first day of Yom Tov. The same goes for the second
night; you should roast it or boil it (at night), and you must eat it on
the second day of Yom Tov, for you are not permitted to cook on the
first day of Yom Tov for the second day, and neither on a Yom Tov for a
weekday. Now, since it is customary not to eat roasted meats on the two
nights of the seder, you should, therefore, eat the shoulder meat on Yom
Tov during the day. Even if you roasted it on erev Yom Tov, you should
not throw away (the meat) afterwards, but you should put it into the
food that is cooked on the second day and eat it on the second day.

6

You should prepare your seat [at the table] while it is still daytime, with
the nicest pillows you can afford, placing them in such a way that you
can recline and lean on the left side. Even a left-handed person should





recline on the left side. You should also prepare the seder plate while it is
still day, in order that immediately on returning home from the
synagogue you can begin the seder without delay.
7

Although during the year, it is best to be moderate in displaying fine
tableware, so that we remember the destruction of the Beis Hamikdash,
nevertheless, on the night of Pesach, it is good to set the table with as
many beautiful things as are within your means. Even vessels not used
for the meal should be placed on the table for elegant decor, to
symbolize freedom.

8

The seder plate is arranged in this manner: You place three matzos on
the seder plate, you cover them with a beautiful cloth, you place the
shankbone on your right side, and the egg on the left; the maror, over
which you say the berachah, you place in the center; the charoses, you
place below the shankbone; the karpas below the egg, and the maror,
that is eaten together with the matzah, you place in the center; as in the
diagram:

9

The wine cups must be whole, without any defect, thoroughly rinsed,
and they must hold no less than a revi'is.

10

It is our custom to wear a kittel (a white robe), which should also be
prepared, while it is still day. A person, in mourning, God forbid,
should not wear it, but he is required to recline. However, if he has
observed no mourning at all before Yom Tov, as, for example, if the
funeral was held on Yom Tov, then, it is customary that he should not
recline. But he must recite Hallel, because the saying of Hallel is
mandatory.




11


A son, at his father's table, is required to recline, but a student, in the
presence of his Rebbe, is not required to recline.

Although on every other Shabbos and Yom Tov, you are permitted to
say kiddush and eat a meal while it is still day, in order to add from the
secular to the holy, on Pesach, you are not permitted to do so. The
mitzvah of eating matzah must be performed only at night, as was the
case with the Pesach sacrifice, about which it is written, ""And they shall
eat the meat (of the Korban Pesach) on this night."" (Exodus 12:8 ). The
mitzvah of the Four Cups may also be done only after nightfall. Since
the cup of wine, over which we say kiddush, is one of the Four Cups,
the kiddush should not be said until it is definitely night. (The person
who conducts the seder) puts on the kittel and takes his seat to conduct
the seder. It is a mitzvah to distribute almonds, nuts and similar things
to the children, so that they notice the change and ask questions, and
this will also stimulate them to ask also the reasons for eating matzah,
maror and reclining. Boys and girls who have reached the age of
training for mitzvos, that is, who are able to understand the holiness of
Yom Tov and understand what is being told about the Exodus from
Egypt, should also be given a cup of wine, from which they should
drink. It is customary to fill an additional cup of wine, and it is called
""The Cup of Elijah the Prophet.""

2

A servant or a member of the household should fill the cups, and each
time the cups are filled, they should fill them, rather than doing it
yourself. This conveys an impression of freedom. You should instruct





the members of the household to drink at least the greater part of each
cup at one time, and of the fourth cup, they should drink a revi'is at
one time. All should have in mind to fulfill the mitzvah of drinking the
Four Cups (of wine), and of relating the story of the Exodus, and eating
matzah and maror, because women, too, are required to perform these
mitzvos, except that they do not recline. You recite the kiddush, as it is
written in the Haggadah, and drink the wine while reclining on your
left side. It is best, if possible, to follow the opinion of the authorities,
and to drink the entire contents of all the Four Cups.
3

After that, you should wash your hands, without saying the berachah,
dry them, and cut the karpas for yourself and for all the members of the
household, giving each less than a kazayis. Each dips his portion in salt
water and says the berachah Borei peri ha'adamah ""Who creates the
fruit of the ground."" They should have in mind to exempt the maror
which will be eaten later with this berachah, and while eating the
karpas, they should also recline on the left side. The person who leads
the Seder then takes the middle matzah and breaks it into two parts,
placing the larger part near his seat for the afikoman. It is customary to
wrap the afikoman in a napkin, to recall what is written, ""Their leftover
dough was wrapped in their clothes"" (Exodus 12:34 ). Some people place
it on their shoulders, to recall the Exodus. Since the afikoman takes the
place of the Pesach sacrifice, it is most esteemed, and the larger portion
of the matzah is set aside for it. The smaller portion, is put back on the
seder plate. He then uncovers the matzos slightly, lifts the seder plate,
and all declare Ha lachma anya diachalu, ""This is the bread of affliction,
which our forefathers ate etc. to leshanah haba'ah benei chorin, ""Next
year we shall be free men."" Those who say, Keha lachma anya (keha





instead of ha), ""Such as this bread of affliction,"" should omit the word
di (which).
4

The second cup is now filled, and a child asks: Mah nishtanah ""Why is
this night different."" If there is no child present, then an older son or
daughter should ask, or a friend or your wife should ask. Then Avadim
hayinu (we were slaves) etc. is said. It is proper to explain to the
members of the family the contents of the Haggadah in the language
they understand. If you do not understand Hebrew, you should use a
Haggadah with a translation, and after completing each paragraph, you
should repeat from the translation, and particularly, the declaration,
Rabban Gamliel hayah omeir (Rabban Gamliel used to say,) because it is
essential to understand the reasons for the Pesach sacrifice, matzah and
maror. At Vehi she'amedah (this promise) etc. you should cover the
matzos (so that the matzah is not slighted when it seems that we are
ignoring it, by lifting only the cup of wine). All take their cups in their
hands and say, Vehi she'amedah, to miyadam, (from their hands), when
you again uncover the matzos. When you say Matzah zo (this matzah)
etc., you should take the half matzah from the seder plate, and show it
to the family and say, Matzah zo (this matzah etc.). When saying Maror
zeh (this maror), you should lift the maror. However, when saying
Pesach shehayu avoseinu ochelim (the Pesach offering which our fathers
ate etc.), you should not raise the shankbone, which is a reminder of
the Pesach offering, for it might appear as if you had set it apart for a
Pesach offering, (which can only be done in the Beis Hamikdash). When
saying, Lefichach (Therefore), you should cover the matzos, and each
person takes his cup in his hand and raises it, holding it until
concluding with Ga'al Yisrael, (Who redeemed Israel). Everyone then





says the berachah, Borei peri hagafen, over their cup of wine, and drink
the cup, while reclining on the left side.
5

After that, everyone should wash their hands, and say the berachah, Al
netilas yadayim, and Hamotzi over the matzos. Since on Yom Tov, we
must say Hamotzi over two whole loaves of bread, and the mitzvah of
matzah requires that we eat the broken one, because matzah is called
""poor man's bread,"" and a poor man generally eats broken pieces of
bread, therefore, when saying Hamotzi, you should take the two whole
matzos in your hands and the broken one between them, and recite
Hamotzi. You then put down the bottom matzah, holding only the top,
and the broken middle matzah, and say the berachah, Al achilat
matzah. You then break off a piece the size of a kazayis, from the top
matzah and from the broken middle matzah. You distribute the same
quantity to every member of the family. Then you eat both pieces
simultaneously, while reclining on the left side. If it is difficult for you
to eat both pieces of matzah at the same time, you should first eat the
kazayis piece over which you said Hamotzi, and then eat the kazayis
piece from the broken matzah. But you should not pause between
eating the two pieces, and eat both pieces while reclining. It is the
custom in our region, at the seder, not to dip the matzah in salt; neither
the matzah, over which Hamotzi is said, nor the one over which Al
achilas matzah is said.

6

If someone is unable to chew the matzah, he is permitted to soak it in
water to soften it, provided it is not completely mashed. An elderly or
sick person, who cannot eat matzah, when soaked in water, may soak it
in wine, or in any other beverage. When you soak the matzah, with
which you want to fulfill the mitzvah (of eating matzah), you must be





careful not to soak it for twenty-four hours, for it would then be
considered as if it were cooked and you could not fulfill the mitzvah
with it. You must also be careful, in other respects, that the matzah
should not lose its status as bread. See Chapter 48:5 above.
7

You then take a kazayis of maror, and distribute portions of the same
quantity to each member of the family. You dip it in the charoses, and
shake off the charoses, so that the maror should not lose its taste, and say
the berachah, Al achilas maror, and eat it without reclining. You then
take a kazayis from the bottom matzah and a kazayis maror. It is also
proper to dip (this maror) in charoses and shake it off. You then place
the maror between (two pieces of ) matzah and say, Kein asa Hillel (This
is the way Hillel did it) etc. and eat it while reclining. The size of a
kazayis, as we have written in the general rules, is as much as half an
egg. However, some authorities hold, that it is a little less than onethird of an egg. Since the mitzvah of eating maror is in our days a
rabbinical requirement, therefore, a person, who finds it difficult to eat
maror, may rely on this (more lenient) opinion, and eat a little less than
one third of an egg, and say the berachah over it. A person who is sick
and cannot eat maror at all, should, nevertheless, chew a little of any of
the species, with which the mitzvah of maror may be fulfilled, or any
bitter tasting herb, until he feels a bitter taste in his mouth; just as a
token, without saying a berachah.

8

After that the meal begins. It is proper to eat the entire meal while
reclining It is customary to eat eggs. It is wise to use good judgment,
and not overeat, so that you will be able to eat the afikoman, as
required, (with appetite), and not on a full stomach. Roast meat should
not be eaten, on the two seder nights, not even roast poultry. Even if it





was boiled and then pot roasted, it should not be eaten. Some have the
custom not to eat any food dipped in liquid, on the seder nights, except
the two required dipped foods, so that it should be prominently
recognized that these two are mitzvos. After completing the meal, the
afikoman is eaten to remind us of the Pesach sacrifice, which was eaten
at the end of the meal so that you should be completely satiated. It is
proper to eat two kazeisim (of matzah for the afikoman), one to remind
us of the Pesach sacrifice, and the other to recall the matzah that was
eaten with the korban Pesach . At any rate, you should not eat less than
a kazayis, and you should eat the afikoman, while reclining. After eating
the afikoman, it is forbidden to eat anything. The third cup is then
filled for Birkas Hamazon. You must make sure that it is clean, not
containing leftover wine, that is to say, nothing is left from the wine, in
which matzah may have been soaked during the meal. If it is not clean,
it requires washing and rinsing (See Chapter 45:4 above). It is a
mitzvah to make an effort to recite Birkas Hamazon with zimun (three
males), but you should not go from house to house to look for people
required for zimun, because each person is required to say Birkas
Hamazon in the place where he has eaten. It is customary for the master
of the house to lead the zimun as it is said: ""A man of a good eye shall
bless,"" (Proverbs 22:9 ) (see Ch. 45:5) and he is called, ""A man of good
eye,"" (i.e. a generous person) because he said: ""All who are hungry—let
them come and eat"" etc. After Birkas Hamazon, the berachah is said
over the third cup, and you should drink it while reclining. It is
forbidden to drink between this cup and the fourth cup.
9

After Birkas Hamazon, the fourth cup is filled. It is the custom to open
the door, to remind us that tonight is a night of Divine vigil, and we are
not afraid of anything. In the merit of our faith in Hashem, our





righteous Mashiach will come, and the Holy One, blessed is He, will
pour out his anger on the nations. Therefore, we recite Shefoch
chamasecha (Pour out Your anger) etc. After that, we say, Lo lanu (Not
for us) and continue reciting the Hallel. When we reach Hodu (Give
thanks), if there are three people present, even if they are his wife and
children, who have reached the age of training for mitzvos, the leader
should say Hodu, and the other two people respond, as it is done in the
synagogue. You are required to drink a full revi's from the fourth cup,
after which you say the after-berachah. You then recite the Haggadah to
the end. After the fourth cup, it is forbidden to drink any beverage,
except water. If you are not too sleepy, you should say Shir hashirim
after the Hagadah. It is customary not to say the bedtime Shema, except
for the section of Shema and the berachah Hamapil, to indicate that it is
a night of divine vigil when Hashem protects us from all evil, and we
need no other protection.
10

A person, who does not drink wine all year, because it causes him
discomfort, nevertheless should make a special effort to drink the Four
Cups, as our Rabbis, of blessed memory, relate about Rabbi Yehudah
bar Rabbi Ilai, who used to drink the Four Cups of wine on Pesach, and
then he would have to wrap his temples until Shavuos (because of the
headache the wine gave him). However, such a person may dilute the
wine with water, or drink raisin wine, (see Chapter 50:6 above), or he
may drink mead, if these are the ""beverage of the country""

11

If the afikoman was lost, and you still have matzah left of those that
were made specifically for the mitzvah, you should eat a kazayis of that
matzah, otherwise, you should eat a kazayis of any other matzah.




12


If you forgot to eat the afikoman; and reminded yourself before saying
Birkas Hamazon, although you already had washed your hands at the
end of the meal or said, ""Come, let us say the blessings,"" you may eat
the afikoman, and do not have to say Hamotzi. And even though you
had not intended to eat anymore, this does not constitute a diversion of
the mind, since it is your duty to eat the afikoman, and are sitting at
Hashem's table, (and must fulfill His will; thus you were not
completely distracted). Nevertheless, you should wash your hands,
without saying Al netilas yadayim. But if you did not remind yourself,
until after saying Birkas Hamazon, before saying Borei peri hagafen over
the third cup, then you should wash your hands again, without saying,
Al netilas yadayim, and recite the berachah of Hamotzi, eat a kazayis of
the afikoman, say Birkas Hamazon; then say the berachah over the third
cup, and drink it. But if you only reminded yourself after saying Borei
peri hagafen over the third cup, you should drink the cup. If on other
occasions you are accustomed to recite Birkas Hamazon, without a cup
of wine, you should wash your hands, eat the afikoman, and say Birkas
Hamazon without a cup of wine. However, if you are scrupulous, and
always says Birkas Hamazon, over a cup of wine, and now cannot do it,
because you would be adding to the four cups, (which is forbidden),
then you should not eat the afikoman, but rely on the matzah, which
you ate before.
"
"1

On the second night of Pesach, we begin counting the Omer. You
should stand during the counting. The mitzvah requires that the Omer
be counted, as soon as possible after nightfall, after (three medium-size





star) stars begin to appear. If you did not count at the beginning of the
evening, you may count the entire night. In the synagogue, on the eve
of Shabbos and Yom Tov, we count after the Kiddush is said, in order to
give precedence to the (proclamation of the) holiness of the day. At the
conclusion of Shabbos and Yom Tov, we count before the Havdalah is
said, in order to delay the end of the day. If the last day of Yom Tov
occurs on Shabbos night, when the Kiddush and the Havdalah are said
over one [the same] cup of wine, we also count before, in order to
postpone the Havdalah.
2

If you forgot to count during the night, you should count during the
daytime, but without a berachah. On subsequent nights, you may
count with a berachah. If you neglected to count an entire day, you
should count on all subsequent nights, without saying the berachah. If
you are not sure whether or not you counted that night, even though
you did not count on the following day, nevertheless, you may count
the remaining days with a berachah.

3

If someone asks you, during twilight or later, ""What is tonight's
count?"" You should tell him, ""Yesterday was such-and-such,"" for if you
would tell him today's count, you are not permitted to say the
berachah, when you count the Omer later that night.

4

Before saying the berachah, you should know what the berachah is for;
that is, you should know the exact number of days of the Omer.
However, if you did not know it, and began the berachah with the
intention of counting the number you will hear from your neighbor,
you have also fulfilled your obligation. Similarly if you say the berachah
with the intention of counting four days, but after completing the





berachah, you realize that you should have counted five days, you
should count five [days], and need not repeat the berachah. Similarly, if
you made an error in counting, for example you should have said ""six
days,"" but you said ""five days,"" if you realize it immediately, you should
count the correct number, and you need not repeat the berachah; but if
you made a short pause, you must repeat the berachah.
5

When the first night of the Yom Tov occurs on Shabbos, ma'aravis are
omitted, and, on the second night of Yom Tov, we say the ma'aravis of
the first night. On Pesach, however, even if the first night occurs on
Shabbos, nevertheless, on the second night we say the ma'aravis
pertaining to that night, because it deals with the harvesting of the
Omer which took place on that night.

6

During [the first] thirty-three days of the Sefirah period (the counting
of the Omer), the disciples of Rabbi Akiva perished. Therefore, it is the
custom during these days to observe a partial state of mourning:
Marriages should not be performed and you should not take a haircut
(or shave). There are various customs regarding (the day on which to
begin) to count these thirty-three days. Some communities have the
custom of counting them beginning with the first day of the Omer,
and, therefore, they forbid [weddings and haircuts] until Lag ba'omer
(the 33rd day of the Omer). But when Rosh Chodesh Iyar occurs on
Shabbos, which has two levels of kedushah (sanctity), the kedushah of
Shabbos and the kedushah of Rosh Chodesh, they permit marriages and
haircuts on erev Shabbos. On Lag ba'omer and from that day on, the
restrictions are permitted, because on Lag ba'omer [Rabbi Akiva's
disciples] ceased to die. We, therefore, rejoice somewhat, and we do not
say Tachanun on that day. Although on that very day some of them





died (mourning need not be observed for a full day), for the Halachah
states, a part of a day is considered as a full day; therefore, you should
not take a haircut, nor should weddings be held; until after dawn (of
Lag ba'omer), but not in the evening. But if Lag ba'omer occurs on
Sunday, you may take a haircut on the preceding erev Shabbos, in honor
of Shabbos.
7

In other communities, they permit (weddings and haircuts) until Rosh
Chodesh Iyar, inclusive, which adds up to sixteen days. This leaves
thirty-three days, during which these things are forbidden, [that is]
until Shavuos, (but they permit haircuts on erev Shavuos). Nevertheless,
on Lag ba'omer they permit (weddings and haircuts); (and if Lag
ba'omer occurs on Sunday, they permit them on erev Shabbos, as I have
written above.) In still other communities, they permit (these things)
until Rosh Chodesh Iyar, exclusive of that day, and on the first day of
Rosh Chodesh, the restrictions begin to apply. On the first of the three
days of Hagbalah [the three days preceding Shavuos,] which is the
thirty-third day (of the period the restrictions are in effect), they apply
the rule, ""A part of day is considered as a full day,"" and they, therefore,
permit marriages and haircuts during these three days, as well as on Lag
ba'omer, (as I have written above). It is essential that the entire
community follow the same custom, and not that some follow one
custom and others follow a different custom.

8

The Sandak, (the person who holds the infant during the bris
circumcision), the mohel, and the father of the infant, are permitted to
take a haircut (and shave) on the day before the bris, towards evening,
before going to the synagogue.




9


Engagement parties, even with a meal, are permitted during all the
Sefirah days; but dancing is forbidden.

10

It is the custom that no work is performed, by either men or women
during the Sefirah days, from sunset, until after the counting of the
Omer. There is an allusion for this (in the Torah), because it is said,
""Seven weeks"" (Leviticus 23:15 ). [The word shabbasos, meaning weeks,]
is derived from shevos, denoting rest, indicating that during the time we
count the Omer, that is from sunset on, you should rest [refrain] from
doing any work, until after you have counted the Omer.

11

On the first night of Shavuos, the Maariv service is delayed, until the
stars come out, for, if we would hold the service before this time, and
usher in the Yom Tov, a bit of time will be lacking from the forty-nine
days of the Sefirah, and the Torah says, ""They shall be seven complete
weeks"" (Leviticus 23:15 ).
"
"1

It is a positive commandment, ordained by the Prophets, to fast on
those days on which tragic events occurred to our forefathers. The
purpose of the fast is to stir our hearts to reflect on the ways of
repentance, and to serve as a reminder of our own evil deeds,and the
deeds of our forefathers, which were as reprehensible as ours, and
caused all these troubles for them as well as for us. By remembering
these events we will improve our ways, as it has been said, ""They will
then confess their sins and the sins of their fathers"" (Leviticus 26:4 ).
Therefore, it is everyone's duty to take it to heart on those days to





examine his past actions and to repent; for fasting is not the main
thing, as it was said about the people of Nineveh, ""And God saw their
deeds"" (Jonah 3:10 ), and our Rabbis, of blessed memory, have said, ""It
does not say, 'He saw their sackcloth and their fast,' but 'God saw their
deeds, that they had turned away from their evil ways.'"" Fasting is only
a preparation for repentance. Therefore those who while fasting, spend
the time taking walks, and doing trivial things, take hold of the least
important aspect of the fast, while ignoring the essence [of the fast.]
2

These are the fast days: the third day of Tishrei, when Gedaliah, the
son of Achikam, was killed. After the Beis Hamikdash was destroyed,
Nebuchadnezzar left him in Eretz Yisrael, and appointed him governor
over Yisrael. Because he [Gedaliah] was assassinated, all Jews were exiled
and thousands of them were killed; thus, the last ember of Jewish hope
died.

3

The tenth day of Teiveis (is a fast day), because the king of Babylonia,
the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, approached Jerusalem, and laid seige to it
and crushed it; and this ultimately led to the destruction of the Beis
Hamikdash.

4

The seventeenth day of Tammuz (is a fast day) because five tragic
events occured on that day: 1) the Tablets [of the Covenant] were
broken by Moses, when he came down from Mount Sinai, as it is
written in the Torah, and this occurred on the seventeenth day of
Tammuz. 2) The continual daily sacrifices were abolished. 3) (The
Romans) broke through the wall of Jerusalem during the destruction of
the second Beis Hamikdash. Although, during the destruction of the
first Beis Hamikdash, the wall was breached on the ninth of Tammuz, as





it is written, ""In the fourth month, on the ninth of the month, the
famine was growing worse in the city, etc. then a breach was made in
the city,"" (Jeremiah 52:6 ), but at the destruction of the second Beis
Hamikdash, the breach was made on the seventeenth day of Tammuz,
and the destruction of the second Beis Hamikdash affects us more
deeply. (Furthermore, it is stated in the Jerusalem Talmud, that even at
the destruction of the first Beis Hamikdash, the breach was made on the
seventeenth, but that because of all the troubles, they made an error in
the date). 4) The wicked Apostomos burned a Torah scroll. 5) An idol
was placed in the Beis Hamikdash by some wicked people among the
Jews, and this caused the destruction of the Beis Hamikdash and our
exile.
5

The ninth day of Av (is a fast day), because on that day the Almighty
decreed that our forefathers in the wilderness, would not enter Eretz
Yisrael, for then the spies had returned (from exploring Canaan), and
Yisrael cried in vain, and it was established as a day of weeping for
future generations. On that day, the first Beis Hamikdash, as well as the
second were destroyed, the city of Betar was captured, which was a large
city, in which an immense number of Jews lived. On that day, Turnus
Rufus plowed the site of the Beis Hamikdash, and the surrounding area,
and, thereby, the verse was fulfilled, ""Zion shall be plowed into a field""
(Jeremiah 26:18 ). (There is another public fast day, the fast of Esther,
see Chapter 141:2 below.)

6

If any of these fast days occurs on Shabbos, it is postponed until after
Shabbos. When the tenth of Teiveis occurs on erev Shabbos, we fast that
entire day.




7


Should any of these four fast days occur during the bridegroom's seven
days of wedding feast, although these days (of the wedding feast) are
considered to him as a Yom Tov, nevertheless, he must fast. Since his
Yom Tov is only a personal celebration, the public mourning and
fasting overrides it, and also, because it is written, ""… if I fail to elevate
Jerusalem above my foremost joy"" (Psalms 137:6 ).

8

There is a difference between the first three fast days and Tisha beAv
(the ninth day of Av). On the first three fast days, you are permitted to
have food during the preceding night until the break of dawn, if you
did not have your regular sleep. If, however, you did have your regular
sleep, you are forbidden to eat or drink afterwards, unless you planned
to do so before going to sleep. If you usually drink something when
getting up from sleep, you need not formulate your plan to have a
drink (when getting up). But on Tishah beAv you must begin the fast
on the day before, while it is still day. On the first three fast days, you
are permitted to wash, to apply cream, to wear leather shoes, and have
marital relations, but on Tishah beAv all these are forbidden. A pious
person, who is in good health, should observe these restrictions on the
other fast days, just as on Tishah beAv, except for the wearing of leather
shoes, because people might ridicule him. Concerning marital relations,
if it is the night of the immersion in the mikveh, he should fulfill his
marital obligation on the first three fast days.

9

There is still another lenient feature regarding the first three fasts:
pregnant and nursing women, are exempt from fasting, if it causes
them discomfort. Also, a sick person, even if he is not critically ill,
should not fast. Nevertheless, even a person who is permitted to eat,





should not enjoy an elaborate meal, but should eat only as much as he
needs to preserve his health. Children, too, although they do not have
to fast, nevertheless, if they understand the significance of mourning, it
is proper to train them, and give them only bread and water, so that
they will be part of the communal mourning.
10

Rinsing your mouth in the morning is forbidden on all public fast days.
The saliva should be spit out, if possible. But if you cannot spit it out,
you are permitted to swallow it, even on Yom Kippur, since you do not
do it for enjoyment. Tasting food, even when spitting it out, is
forbidden on a public fast day. But on a fast day, which you undertake
voluntarily, you are permitted to taste food and then spit it out.
Similarly, rinsing your mouth is permitted on a private fast day.

11

It is a mitzvah, for every Jewish community, when they are beset with
trouble, God forbid, to fast and pray to Hashem, blessed is His Name,
(for rescue) from their troubles. But if the time is not appropriate for
fasting, for instance, if people are fleeing, they are not permitted to fast,
lest their strength will be sapped. However they should resolve to fast a
certain number of fast days, when they are saved. This will be counted
as if they were now fasting, as we find concerning Daniel, about whom
it is written, ""He said to me, 'Do not be afraid, Daniel; for from the
day you resolved to understand and to fast before your God, your
words were heard'"" (Daniel 10:12 ).
"
"1

Since the Seventeenth of Tammuz, marks the beginning of the anguish
of the destruction of the Beis Hamikdash, it is customary to observe a





partial mourning, from that day until after Tishah beAv. It is proper for
every God-fearing person to recite Tikun Chatzos (the special midnight
order), daily, in the afternoon. No weddings are performed, even for a
person who has not yet fulfilled the mitzvah of Piryah Verivyah (""Be
fertile and have many children."") But engagement parties, even with a
meal, are permitted until Rosh Chodesh Av. Although it is permissible to
make engagements after Rosh Chodesh, nevertheless, it is forbidden to
serve a meal (at the engagement party), but it is permitted to serve
desserts and other delicacies. A Jew, who makes his living as a
professional musician, is permitted to play in the house of a non-Jew,
until Rosh Chodesh Av, but from Rosh Chodesh until after Tishah beAv,
he is forbidden to play. On the seventeenth day of Tammuz, itself, as
well as on the tenth of Teiveis. he is also forbidden to play. Some people
have the custom not to eat meat, nor to drink wine from the
Seventeenth of Tammuz until after Tishah beAv, except on Shabbos or
at a meal that is considered a mitzvah.
2

It is customary not to say the berachah, Shehecheyanu during these days.
Therefore, you should not buy or put on a new garment, since that
would make it necessary for you to say the berachah, Shehecheyanu. But
at the occasion of a Pidyon haben, (redemption of the firstborn),
Shehecheyanu must be said, so as not to postpone the fulfillment of the
mitzvah. Concerning a new fruit, we are lenient and say Shehecheyanu
on Shabbos or even on a weekday, if this fruit will not be available after
Tishah beAv. Teachers should not strike students, and parents should
not strike their children during these days.

3

It is the custom not to have the hair cut during these days, neither the
hair of the head, nor of the beard nor of any part of the body. Adults





are forbidden to give their children a haircut.
4

It seems to me that it should be permissible to trim the mustache, until
the week in which Tishah beAv occurs, if it interferes with your eating,
but during the week in which Tishah beAv occurs, it should be
forbidden.

5

Cuting the nails is forbidden only during the week of Tishah beAv, but
for the purpose of immersion in the mikveh, a woman is permitted to
cut her nails during that week. Also, a mohel is permitted to trim his
nails for the requirements of periah (removal of the thin membrane).

6

On the three Shabbosos between the seventeenth of Tammuz and Tishah
beAv, we read the ""Three haftaros of retribution,"" which are: Divrei
Yirmiyahu (The words of Jeremiah) (Jeremiah 1:1 ), Shim'u devar
Hashem, (Hear the word of Hashem) (Jeremiah 2:4 ), Chazon Yeshayahu,
(The vision of Isaiah) (Isaiah 1:1 ). Their initials form the acronym
DeShaCh. If, by mistake, the reader recited on the first Shabbos the
haftarah of the weekly portion, on the second Shabbos, he should read
the haftarah of both Divrei Yirmiyahu and Shim'u, because they are
close to each other. If Rosh Chodesh Av occurs on Shabbos, he reads the
haftarah Hashamayim Kis'i (The heaven is My throne) (Isaiah 66 ), but
in some communities, the haftarah Shim'u is read.

7

When the month of Av arrives, we should restrict such activities that
create happiness. You should not build a building meant for enjoyment
or strictly for relaxation. If you made a contract with a non-Jew, to have
your house painted, and you can persuade him for a small
compensation, to wait until after Tishah beAv, that would be the right





thing to do, but if he cannot be persuaded, you may have the work
done. If a Jew has a lawsuit against a non-Jew, he should postpone it,
because it is an unlucky period. If possible, he should postpone it until
after the end of the month, or at least until after Tishah beAv. We do
not sanctify the new moon until after Tishah beAv.
8

It is the accepted custom in all Yisrael not to eat meat or drink wine
during the nine days, from Rosh Chodesh until after Tishah beAv. It is
even forbidden to eat food that was cooked with meat or that contains
animal fat; even poultry is forbidden. However, a person, who is
sensitive to dairy food, is permitted to eat poultry, and for a sick
person, all restrictions are lifted. Nevertheless, if it is not too difficult
for him, he should abstain from eating (any kind of meat) from the
seventh of Av on. Also, some women, who have given birth, abstain
from meat and wine, from the seventh of Av on, for on that day, the
heathens entered the Beis Hamikdash (See Chapter 124:2 below). At a
meal that is considered a mitzvah, such as a bris (circumcision), a pidyon
haben (redemption of the first-born son), or the conclusion of a Talmud
tractate, it is permitted to eat meat and drink wine. Aside from your
parents, brothers and children, and those involved with the mitzvah,
you may also invite ten other friends, but only such friends [who, if the
meal would have been held] at any other time, would also have joined
you. All these mitzvah meals are permitted even on erev Tishah beAv
before noon, but not later than that. The festive meal, that is usually
made on the night before the bris, is not considered a mitzvah meal (see
163:8 above). It is forbidden to have meat and wine [at such meals];
rather you should serve dairy food instead. Regarding the cup of wine
for Havdalah on Shabbos night, if there is a child who is able to drink





the greater part of the cup, it should be given to him, otherwise, the
person reciting the Havdalah may drink it.
9

You should not wash any laundry during the nine days; not even a shirt
or a garment that you will not wear until after the fast day. It is
forbidden even to have it washed by a non-Jewish washerwoman. A
Jewish woman is permitted to wash the clothes of a non-Jew;
nevertheless, during the week in which Tishah beAv occurs, she should
be diligent [not to do this work]. During these nine days, it is also
forbidden to put on laundered clothing, or to spread linen, even if they
were washed before. However in honor of Shabbos, you may put on
clean linen garments (undershirts and socks) and spread a fresh
tablecloth on the table, and change washcloths and towels, just as you
do on other Shabbosos. But it is forbidden to spread clean sheets. A
woman who is required to put on clean white undergarments when she
begins to count the seven clean days, is permitted to wash her
undergarments, and to put them on. Also diapers, which are dirtied
constantly, may be washed.

10

During these nine days, you should not have new garments, or new
shoes made or socks knitted, even by a non-Jewish craftsman. However
if you need them urgently, such as for a wedding that will be held
immediately after Tishah beAv, you are permitted to use a non-Jewish
craftsman, but not a Jew. Before Rosh Chodesh Av, you are permitted, in
any case, to arrange that clothes or shoes be made, even by a Jewish
craftsman, who may make them, even after (Rosh Chodesh Av).

11

Women who have the custom not to arrange the threads for weaving,
during these nine days because this (the warp), is called in Hebrew





shesi, and since the destruction of the Even hashesiyah (foundation
stone) which was in the Beis Hamikdash, they imposed this stringency
on themselves, (mindful of the similarity of shesi and shesiyah); it is
forbidden to let them (arrange the threads).
12

You should not take a bath during these nine days, even in cold water.
However for medical reasons, as, for example, when a woman has given
birth, or a pregnant woman, close to childbirth, for whom bathing is
beneficial, or a weak person, whose physician ordered him to bathe,
these are permitted to bathe, even in warm water. A woman, who was
menstrually unclean, may bathe and immerse herself in the mikveh as
usual. If she has to immerse herself on the night after Tishah beAv, and
it will be impossible for her to take the required bath (on Tishah beAv),
she is permitted to bathe on erev Tishah beAv. Similarly, when she puts
on clean undergarments, [to begin counting her seven clean days], she
is permitted to bathe a little in her accustomed manner because she is
not doing it for pleasure.

13

If Rosh Chodesh Av occurs on erev Shabbos, and you are accustomed to
bathe in warm water every erev Shabbos, you are permitted to bathe,
even in warm water. But on erev Shabbos Chazon, it is forbidden to
bathe in warm water, even if you usually do so. Only the face, hands
and feet (may be washed with warm water). Similarly, if you are
accustomed to wash your head every erev Shabbos, you are permitted to
do so this erev Shabbos, but not with soap or a solution of lye. If you are
accustomed to immerse yourself in the mikveh every erev Shabbos, you
are permitted to immerse yourself in cold water; but if you omit it
occasionally, you are forbidden to do so.




14


A mourner, whose thirtieth day of mourning occurs on the eighteenth
day of Tammuz or after that, is permitted to take a haircut, until the
day before Rosh Chodesh Av. But from Rosh Chodesh on, even in such a
case, he is forbidden to bathe or to take a haircut.

15

At a bris that occurs during the nine days, it is customary for the mohel,
the sandak, and the parents of the infant to wear Shabbos clothing, but
the man who brings in the child (gefatter) is forbidden to do so.
However, the woman who brings in the child customarily wears
Shabbos clothes, since this is the only part of the entire mitzvah she can
fulfill. They are permitted to have their haircut before Shabbos Chazon,
but after that, it is forbidden.

16

We wrote in paragraph 9 that on Shabbos Chazon, you may put on
clean linen garments, that is, undershirts and socks, which (you change)
only because of perspiration. But regarding other Shabbos clothing, it
depends on the local custom, whether or not you may change to
Shabbos clothing. At the synagogue, we change the paroches [coverning
of the Torah ark], also the table coverings and the mantles, on Shabbos
Chazon; but not on the Shabbos which occurs on Tishah beAv.

17

It is customary on Shabbos Chazon to call the rabbi, who knows the
special mournful chant, for the reading of the maftir; thus, he should
not be called up (as usual), for the third aliyah.
"
"1

When a bris or a pidyon haben occur on erev Tishah beAv, the festive
meal should be held before noon.




2


You should not go for a walk on erev Tishah beAv; and in the afternoon,
it is the custom to study only the subjects you are permitted to study
on Tishah beAv.

3

Concerning the final meal before the fast, there are many laws. The
correct custom is to eat a regular meal before the Minchah service. After
that, you pray Minchah, omitting Tachanun, because Tishah beAv is
called a Moed as it is written, ""He has proclaimed a Moed for me""
(Lamentations 1:15 ). Towards evening, you should sit on the floor but it
is not necessary to take off your shoes. Three people should not sit
down (to eat) together, so that they will not be required (to recite Birkas
Hamazon) with zimun. You should eat only bread and a cold hardboiled egg. You should dip a small piece of bread in ashes and eat it.
You should be careful to finish the meal while it is still day. (Whether
you are permitted to eat after this, see 131:12 below).

4

If a person fasts throughout the year on Mondays and Thursdays, and
erev Tishah beAv occurs on either of these days, he should have his vow
annulled. If someone observes Yahrtzeit on erev Tishah beAv, he should
resolve on the first Yahrtzeit, to fast only until noon has passed, then he
should pray Minchah gedolah (early Minchah), that is, half-an-hour past
noon, eat a meal, and afterwards towards evening, he should eat the
final meal.

5

During twilight, you are forbidden to do all that is forbidden on Tishah
beAv. You must, therefore, take off your shoes before twilight.
"
"



1


In the evening, upon entering the synagogue, you should remove your
shoes (as we have written at the conclusion of the previous chapter). It
is customary to remove the covering of the Torah Ark, because it is
written, ""He has carried out His word"" (Lamentations 2:17 ) (for
explanation, see 124:3 below) and to have only one light in front of the
Chazzan. We pray Maariv in a low and tearful voice, like mourners. We
do not say Nacheim (comfort) until the Shemoneh Esrei of Minchah of
the next day. After the Shemoneh Esrei, the Chazzan says the whole
Kaddish including tiskabbeil, and everyone sits on the floor. Then a few
lights are lit, sufficient for the congregation to say Eichah
(Lamentations) and Kinnos. Eichah and kinnos are also recited in a low,
tearful voice. When saying Eichah, a short pause should be made
between one verse and the other, and a slightly longer pause between
one chapter and the other. At the beginning of each chapter of Eichah,
the Chazzan raises his voice a little more. The last verse of each chapter
should be said in a loud voice, and when he reaches the verse
Hashiveinu etc. (Bring us back), the congregation recites it aloud. The
Chazzan then concludes the reading, and the congregation repeats
Hashiveinu etc. aloud, and the Chazzan does the same. After that,
Ve'atah kadosh (You are the Holy One) is recited by the congregation
and the complete Kaddish without tiskabbeil is said by the Chazan,
since it says in Eichah, ""He shuts out My prayer"" (Lamentations 3:8 ).
The next morning at Shacharis, tiskabbeil is again omitted in the
Kaddish. It is not said until Minchah. A person who prays by himself,
because he can find no minyan (quorum of ten males thirteen years and
older), should also recite Eichah and Kinnos.




2


You should express grief in the manner of your sleeping. For example, if
you are accustomed to sleep on two pillows, you should sleep only on
one. Some people have the custom to sleep on the floor during the
night of Tishah beAv, and to put a stone underneath their head as a
reminder of what was said, ""And he took some of the stones of the
place etc.,"" (Genesis 28:11 ). Our Sages comment that Jacob foresaw the
destruction of the Beis Hamikdash and said, ""How frightful"" etc. (verse
17). It all depends on the person's attitude.

3

In the morning, we do not put on the tefillin, because tefillin are called
an ""ornament."" Neither do we put on the large tallis, because it is
written, ""Bitza imraso"" (Lamentations 2:17 ), and the Targum translates,
""He tore his purple cloak apart."" But you should put on your tallis
katan (small tallis) without saying a berachah. You should go to the
synagogue a bit earlier than usual. No light should be lit for the prayers.
Again, prayers should be said in a low and tearful voice. We do say
Mizmor Lesodah (a Psalm of thanksgiving). In the repetition of the
Shemoneh esrei the Chazzan says Aneinu (Answer us) between Ga'al
Yisrael (the Redeemer of Israel) and Refa'einu (Heal us), as on every
other public fast day. He does not say the Birkas kohanim (priestly
blessing). After the Shemoneh esrei, he says half-kaddish. We do not say
Tachanun or Keil erech apayim (O' God, slow to anger), because Tishah
beAv is called a moed. A Seifer Torah is taken out and the section Ki
solid banim etc. is read (When you will have children) etc.
(Deuteronomy 4:25 ), is read for three persons. It is proper for the one
called up, to say quietly, Baruch dayan ha'emes (Blessed is the true
Judge) before saying the berachah. After the reading of the Torah, halfkaddish is said, and the haftarah is read of the chapter, Asof asifeim, [I





will destroy them completely] (Jeremiah 8:13 ) in the tone of Eichah.
The Seifer Torah is then replaced in the Ark. Everyone is seated on the
floor to say Kinnos. The saying of kinnos should be drawn out, until
close to noon. Then Ashrei (Fortunate are those) is said omitting
Lamenatzei'ach, (For the conductor), and we say Uva letziyon go'eil [A
redeemer shall come to Zion] etc., but we omit the verse Va'ani zos
berisi [And as for Me, this is My covenant], for it would appear, as if He
established a covenant for the Kinnos, and, besides, it would be
inappropriate to say Va'ani zos berisi etc., Lo yamushu mipicha etc. (My
words shall not depart from your mouth), since no one is studying
Torah, as Torah study is forbidden (on Tishah beAv). But at a mourner's
house, during the entire year, except on Tishah beAv, the verse should
be said, for, although the mourner is not studying Torah, those that
come to console him are not exempt [from Torah study]. Then, Ve'atah
kadosh is said (And You are the Holy One) etc., followed by the
complete kaddish, omitting tiskabbeil, then Aleinu (It is our duty) is
said, and the mourner's kaddish. We do not say Shir hayichud (Song of
God's Unity), nor Shir shel yom (Song of the day), nor Pittum haketores
(The incense mixture). It is proper for everyone to read Eichah
afterwards
4

If there is a mourner in the town, he should go to the synagogue on the
night (of Tishah beAv) and also during the day, (and stay) until the
conclusion of the Kinnos. He is permitted to receive an aliyah and to
read the haftarah, because we all are mourners (on Tishah beAv).

5

The words of the Torah gladden the heart, as it is said, ""The precepts of
Hashem are upright, gladdening the heart"" (Psalms 19:9 ). Therefore, it
is forbidden to study Torah on Tishah beAv, except for subjects that





sadden the heart, such as the chapters of the book of Jeremiah,
regarding the ominous events he prophesied, omitting the verses of
consolation. Also the verses foretelling the punishment to be meted out
to the nations of the world that are written there, should be omitted. It
is also permitted to study the Book of Job, as well as Midrash Eichah.
[The following Talmudic selections may also be studied:] the Talmud,
chapter Eilu megalchin, (Moed Katan, 3rd chapter), which deals with
the laws of a mourner, and a person who was excommunicated, and the
Aggadic portion of the chapter Hanizakin (Maseches Gittin 55b), and in
the Jerusalem Talmud, the last part of the Maseches Ta'anis, which
discusses the destruction of the Beis Hamikdash. But even the chapters
you are permitted to study, you are forbidden to study in depth, to find
an answer to a difficult question or a homiletic interpretation, for that
would gladden the heart. Any subject you, yourself, are permitted to
study, you are permitted to teach to children. You are permitted to read
the entire order of daily prayers, even the Mishnah of Eizehu mekoman
(What is the location [of the offerings?]). But you should not say
Ma'amados, even if you are accustomed to saying it every day.
6

Even if pregnant and nursing women suffer very much, they are
required to complete the fast, unless, God forbid, this might endanger
their health. However, a sick person, even if his condition is not critical,
should be lenient, and should not complete the fast, but fast only for a
few hours. This is especially true if he is weak by nature. A woman,
from the seventh until the thirtieth day after giving birth, is governed
by the same halachah that applies to a sick person, whose condition is
not critical, even though she is not really sick. However, if she feels that
she is in perfect health and the fast will not harm her, she should
complete the fast. Those who must eat on Tishah beAv should not enjoy





an elaborate meal, but should eat no more than they need to preserve
their health.
7

You are forbidden to wash yourself, whether in hot or cold water. Even
dipping your fingers in water is forbidden. But only washing for
pleasure is forbidden, however, when it is not for pleasure, it is
permitted. You may, therefore, wash your hands in the morning. But
you should be careful to wash only your fingers, for this constitutes the
mitzvah of washing in the morning, to remove the evil spirit, that rests
on the fingers. After you dry your hands a little, while they are still
slightly damp, you may pass them over your eyes. If your eyes are sticky
and you usually wash them in the morning, you may wash them now
also, as usual, and you need not be concerned about it. Similarly, if
your hands are soiled with mud or other dirt, you may wash the dirty
spots. After going to the bathroom, you may wash your hands lightly in
the usual manner. Also, for the Minchah service, you should wash your
fingers.

8

Women who need to rinse the foods used in cooking, are permitted to
do so, because their purpose is not to wash their hands. If you are on
your way to perform a mitzvah, and the only way you can get there is
by crossing a stream, you may cross it on your way there and on
returning, and you need not be concerned about it. However, if you are
going for business, you may cross it on your way going, but on your
return trip it is forbidden. If you return from the road and your feet feel
weak, you may bathe them in water.

9

Although only bathing for pleasure is forbidden, nevertheless, a woman
whose time for tevilah (immersion) occurs on the night of Tishah beAv





should not do the tevilah, since marital relations are forbidden (on
Tishah beAv). (Regarding the putting on of white undergarments, see
chapter 159 below).
10

Applying cream, too, is forbidden only, if it is done for pleasure. But a
person who has pimples or needs it for any other medical treatment,
may apply cream or ointment.

11

Wearing shoes is forbidden only, if they are made of leather. Shoes
made of cloth or similar material, which do not have leather soles, may
be worn. People who have to walk among non-Jews, as a rule wear
leather shoes, in order not to be ridiculed, but they should put some
earth in their shoes. Nevertheless, a pious person should observe the law
stringently. Storekeepers are surely forbidden to wear leather shoes. Our
Sages, of blessed memory, ruled that since it is very exhausting, a person
who has to go a long distance on foot is permitted to wear leather
shoes. But when he approaches a city, he must take them off. But a
person riding in a vehicle is forbidden to wear leather shoes.

12

It is forbidden to have marital relations. One should be strict about
this, and not even touch his wife.

13

You are forbidden to greet your neighbor on Tishah beAv, even to say
""good morning,"" or any similar greeting. If an unlearned person or a
non-Jew says hello to you, you may answer in a low voice, for
otherwise, they would be angry with you. It is also forbidden to send a
gift to your neighbor, because this is a form of greeting.

14

You should not stroll in public places, in order to avoid laughter and
frivolity. Some authorities forbid smoking the entire day, while others





permit it in the afternoon, in the privacy of the home.
15

It is our custom, that any work requiring time, even work for which no
skill is required, is forbidden the night (of Tishah beAv), and in the
daytime, until noon. But work that does not take long to do, like
lighting candles or tying a knot, is permitted. In the afternoon, all work
is permitted. It is also the custom to forbid doing business before noon,
but to permit in the afternoon. However, a God-fearing man should be
stringent in his observance the entire day, and not do any work, nor do
any business, so that his mind should not be distracted from mourning.
It is permitted, however, to instruct a non-Jew to do any kind of work
for you. Any work, that if not done, would entail a loss, you are
permitted to do yourself. Milking the cows preferably should be done
by a non-Jew, but when that is impossible, you are permitted to do it
yourself.

16

It is the custom not to sit on a bench (or chair), either at night, or in
the day until the afternoon; but to sit only on the floor. In the
afternoon, it is permitted. However, the other things that are forbidden,
are forbidden until the stars appear.

17

It is customary not to start preparing the meal before noon, but (if the
meal is) for the purpose of a mitzvah, it is permitted.

18

If there is to be a bris, the bris should be performed after the saying of
the Kinnos has ended. The father and the mother (of the infant), the
sandak and the mohel, may put on their Shabbos clothes in honor of the
bris. After the bris, they should take them off. Candles should be lit in
honor of the bris, and the cup of wine is given to a child to drink.




19


At the Minchah service, we put on the tallis and the tefillin, saying the
berachah over them. The Shir shel yom (Song of the day) is said, as well
as the other things that were omitted in the Shacharis service. Then
Ashrei and half- kaddish are said. We read the Torah and the maftir, as
on any other public fast day. Then the seifer Torah is replaced in the Ark
and the Chazzan says half- kaddish, after which the Shemoneh esreih is
said. We insert Nacheim (Console, O God) in the berachah
Velirushalayim (And to Jerusalem). If you forgot to say it there, you
should say it after Aneinu (Answer us), but you should not conclude the
prayer, with Baruch menacheim [Blessed … Consoler] etc., but with Ki
atah shomei'a (For You hear the prayers) etc. But if you did not realize it
until after you said Baruch atah Hashem [Blessed are You, Hashem],
you conclude the berachah Shomei'a tefillah [Who hears prayer] and
continue praying according to the regular order, and you do not have to
repeat [the Shemoneh esrei]. The Chazzan, in the repetition of the
Shemoneh esrei, recites the Birkas kohanim (Priestly Blessing). After the
Shemoneh esrei, he says the whole kaddish with tiskabbeil. We then take
off the tefillin and pray Maariv. If the moon is shining, we recite
Kiddush levanah (Sanctification of the moon). See 97:11 above, where
it is stated that you must taste some food first.

20

We are taught in a Beraisa, ""On the seventh day of Av, the heathens
entered the Beis Hamikdash. They ate and drank and wreaked havoc in
it on the seventh and eighth days, and on the ninth, towards evening,
they set fire to the Beis Hamikdash, and it continued to burn
throughout the tenth day until sunset. The reason the fast was not set
for the tenth day, although the greater part of the Beis Hamikdash was
burned on that day, is because the beginning of a punishment is felt





more severly. In the Jerusalem Talmud it is stated, ""Rabbi Avin fasted
on the ninth and on the tenth,"" ( Maseches Taanis 4:6). Rabbi Levi
fasted on the ninth and on the night of the tenth. Because he did not
have the strength to fast the entire tenth day, he fasted during the night
only. But as for us, since our strength has waned, we fast only on the
ninth, but we impose a stringency on ourselves, in that we do not eat
meat, nor do we drink wine, during the night of the tenth day, nor on
the tenth day until noon, unless it is at a meal that is considered a
mitzvah. Also, the berachah Shehecheyanu should not be said; neither
should you take a bath, or a haircut, or wash clothes, until noon of the
tenth day. A person who imposes upon himself to observe all the abovementioned restrictions for the entire tenth day of Av, is to be praised. If
the tenth of Av occurs on erev Shabbos, you may bathe, take a haircut
and wash immediately in the morning, in honor of the Shabbos.
21

A woman who has given birth, although she fasts after seven days [after
giving birth], is permitted, on the night of the tenth, to eat meat and
drink wine.

22

It is proper not to have marital relations on the night of the tenth,
unless it is on the night of her tevilah (immersion), or if he is going on
a trip, or returned from a trip.
"
"1

If Tishah beAv occurs on Sunday, or if it occurs on Shabbos and is
deferred to Sunday, you may eat meat and drink wine on Shabbos.
Even at the third meal, after Minchah, you may eat everything but you
should not have this meal in the company of friends. If a bris is to be





held, the meal should be served before Minchah. But you are permitted
to eat the third meal with your family, and you may say Birkas
Hamazon with zimun. You must finish the meal, while it is still
daytime, because at twilight you are forbidden to eat, drink or wash.
However, you should not take off your shoes until after Barechu is said.
The Chazzan takes off his shoes before saying Vehu Rachum [He, the
Merciful One], so that he should not get confused; but before [taking
off his shoes] he should say: Baruch hamavdil bein kodesh lechol [Blessed
is He Who separates between the holy and the secular], without
mentioning Hashem's Name and Kingship [Hashem Elokeinu melech
haolam].
2

If Friday night is the night of Tishah beAv, it is forbidden to have
marital relations, unless it is the night of her tevilah [immersion].

3

We say Av harachamim [Father of compassion], and we say memorial
prayers in Shacharis, but in Minchah, we do not say Tzidkasecha tzedek
[Your righteousness is everlasting].

4

If Tishah beAv occurs on Shabbos, you should be stringent and study
only those subjects that you are allowed to study on Tishah beAv;
therefore, we do not say Pirkei Avos. Reading the sidrah of the week
twice and the Targum once, is permitted, before noon. If erev Tishah
beAv occurs on Shabbos, it is forbidden to study in the afternoon, as on
any other erev Tishah beAv.

5

Before Maariv, we do not say Lamenatzei'ach bineginos, neither do we
say Vihi no'am before Ve'atah Kadosh, for this was composed for the
setting up of the Mishkan [Tabernacle] and now it is destroyed. Neither





do we say Veyitein lecha (May Hashem grant you), nor do parents bless
their children.
6

At dark, when you see the candlelight, you should say the berachah
Borei me'orei ha'eish [Who creates the lights of fire], and in the
Shemoneh esrei we say: Ata chonantanu [You have favored us.] We do
not say Havdalah over the cup of wine until the conclusion of Tishah
beAv. But you should not say the berachah over the spices and over the
light, even if you failed to say (the berachah over the light) on Shabbos
night. You should caution your family not to do do any work before
they say Hamavdil bein kodesh lechol [Who separates between the holy
and the secular] without mentioning Hashem's Name and Kingship. If
you forget to say Ata chonantanu, you need not repeat [the Shemoneh
esrei], but you should finish the Shemoneh esrei, (as stated in Chapter
96, above), because you will say Havdalah over wine at the end of
Tishah beAv. You should not taste any food before Havdalah, and if you
find it necessary to do some work, you should first say: Hamavdil bein
kodesh etc., without mentioning Hashem's Name and Kingship.

7

When Tishah beAv occurs on Shabbos, and it is deferred to Sunday, it is
forbidden to eat meat or drink wine on the night after the fast as it is
on any other Tishah beAv, because of the mourning observed on that
day. On the following morning, everything is permitted.

8

If a bris is to be held on a deferred Tishah beAv, it is permitted for the
main participants, i.e. the father and mother of the infant, the mohel
and the sandak to pray the Minchah gedolah, that is one half hour past
midday. They may then recite the Havdalah over wine and eat and
wash, but they should not have the festive meal until the night.





Similarly, when a pidyon haben is held, that has not been postponed,
the father and the kohen should not complete the fast.

After the Beis Hamikdash was destroyed, our Sages, of blessed memory,
ordained that on every joyous occasion, there should be a remembrance
of the destruction of the Beis Hamikdash, as it is written: ""If I forget
you, Jerusalem, if I fail to elevate Jerusalem above my foremost joy""
(Psalms 137:5 ). They decreed that no Jew should build a house for
himself that is lime-plastered and decorated like a royal palace. Neither
should he lime plaster his entire house, but he may plaster the house,
with clay and then lime plaster, it (lit. whitewash it), and he should
leave a space of one square amah opposite the entrance unplastered, as a
reminder of the destruction [of the Beis Hamikdash. ] We do not know
of any good reason why people do not observe this custom nowadays.

2

They also ordained that if you are setting a table, and are having guests
for a meal, even for a meal that is considered a mitzvah, you should not
serve all the dishes that are conventionally served at a meal. They also
ordained that a woman should not wear all her jewelry at one occasion,
and that a bridegroom before the chuppah [wedding ceremony], should
have ashes put on his head on the place where the tefillin are worn, and
the veil, with which the bride is covered, should not contain any silver
or gold threads. It is also customary, that after the tenaim [engagement
agreement] has been read to break a plate, as a reminder of the
destruction of the Beis Hamikdash, but a damaged plate is used (for that





purpose). Under the chuppah the bridegroom breaks a glass, and for this
purpose, a whole glass may be used.
3

They also decreed, that we should not listen to musical instruments not
even to the singing of songs. During meals, you should sing only the
traditional zemiros [songs of praise], like those we sing on Shabbos; but
it is forbidden to sing other songs.

4

Take heed not to attend animal shows presented by non-Jews or their
dances or any of their social functions. When you hear them giving
voice to their happiness, you should sigh and agonize over the
destruction of Jerusalem, and pray for it unto the Holy One blessed is
He. Even animal shows presented by Jews, are forbidden because it is a
""Gathering of scorners."" All kinds of rejoicing are forbidden, except
making a groom and a bride happy which may be done both by singing
and with musical instruments. But even at a wedding, you should not
overdo the merry making. It is forbidden for anybody to laugh
exuberantly in this world, even when rejoicing in the performance of a
mitzvah, for it is said: ""Then our mouth will be filled with laughter""
(Psalms 126:2 ). [When Hashem will return the captivity to Zion].
"
"1

Just as it is a mitzvah for the community to fast and to pray in times of
trouble, so it is a mitzvah for every individual, if, God forbid, any
trouble befalls him, for example, a member of his family is sick, or he
lost his way, or he is confined in prison on false charges, to fast and to
pray to God, and to plead for mercy from Him, may His Name be
blessed, to deliver him. Suffering is one of the ways that leads to





repentance. A person should not say, his troubles just happened by
chance, for it is said: (Leviticus 26:23 ,24). ""If you treat My (acts) as
chance, then I will treat you with the fury of chance""; which means,
when I bring distress on you to cause you to repent and you will say
this happened by chance, then I will add to your (suffering) the fury of
the same ""chance."" Man must know that because of his sins, God
brought on him all this trouble. He should, therefore, examine his
deeds and return to God, and He will have mercy on him.
2

If you wish to fast, you must make a commitment to do so on the
preceding day, during the Shemoneh esrei of Minchah. In the berachah
Shema koleinu [Hear our voices], you should mentally accept upon
yourself, to fast and before saying Yiheyu leratzon, you should say,
Master of the universe, I come before You to accept a fast etc. (as it is
written in the siddur [prayer book].) Even though you eat and drink,
afterwards until daybreak, it does not matter. If you want to fast several
days in succession, although you will eat and drink during the
intervening nights, one acceptance [commitment] is sufficient for all.
But if you accept upon yourself [to fast] several days that are not in
succession, like Monday, Thursday, and Monday, you should make a
separate commitment, for each day you fast, in the Minchah preceding
it.

3

If you are accustomed to fast during the Aseres yemei teshuvah, [the Ten
Days of Penitence] or on the first day of Selichos or on erev Rosh
Hashanah, you do not have to make a formal commitment because they
are accepted on the basis of the prevailing custom. Similarly, fasting
because of a disturbing dream, does not require prior acceptance;
neither do the fasts on Monday, Thursday and Monday following





Pesach and Sukkos. If you answer Amein after the Mi shebeirach [a
blessing for those who fast on these days] and you intended to fast, this
is sufficient, and no other form of acceptance is needed. Nevertheless, if
you change your mind, and do not wish to fast, you may [eat], since
you did not expressly commit yourself and did not verbally declare that
you intend to fast.
4

Even if you did not commit yourself verbally, to fast; doing so, only in
your mind, resolving to fast the following day, and even [if you made
this resolution] not during Minchah, but either before or after Mincha,
while it was still daytime, it is considered an acceptance, and you are
required to fast.

5

When you fast, you should not indulge in enjoyment, nor act
frivolously. You should not go around happy and cheerful, but rather
with anxiety and sorrow, as it is said: ""Why should a living man
bemoan? A man, because of his sins!"" (Lamentations 3:39 ).

6

On a private fast day, you are allowed to rinse your mouth with water,
in the morning.

7

If you committed yourself to fast without being specific, you must
complete the fast until the stars come out, even on erev Shabbos.

8

If someone fasts and publicizes the fact, bragging about it, he will be
punished for it. But if people urge him to eat, he may let them know
that he is fasting.

9

If you observe a fast, even if it is a private fast, whether it is a voluntary
fast, or a fast because of a disturbing dream, you should say in the





Shemoneh esrei of Minchah, in the berachah Shema koleinu [Hear our
voice], the prayer Aneinu [Answer us], the same as on any public fast
day. (And although you are only one individual, you should say it in
the plural, and not deviate from the formula, that was established by
the Sages). Before saying Yiheyu leratzon, you should say Ribbon
ha'olamim [Master of the universe] etc.
10

If you vowed to fast one day or ten days, but you did not specify the
particular day or days, on which you were going to fast, but you stated
it in indefinite terms, even if you committed yourself in the Minchah
prayer to fast the following day, if an urgent need arises for you to eat
something, for example, if you are invited to a meal, that is considered
a mitzvah, even though you are not a party to the festive meal; or an
important person urges you to join him in a meal, and it is difficult for
you to refuse him, or if you do not feel well [enough to fast], then you
may ""owe"" the fast [and repay it later] and you may eat on that day,
even if you already began to fast, and instead of fasting that day, you
should fast another day. This is permissible only if the fast, you had
accepted on yourself, was meant to fulfill a vow, however, if you had
made no vow, but (specifically) committed yourself during Minchah to
fast the following day, then, even if it causes you great distress, you are
not permitted to ""owe"" your fast and repay it another day.

11

If at the time you made the vow, you specified certain days, and you
also accepted it on yourself during Minchah, you may no longer ""owe""
your fast (to be paid later.).

12

If you undertook to fast, and are experiencing grave discomfort because
of it, you may redeem it with money, according to your means, and you





should give the money to the poor. But for a fast in fulfillment of a
vow, redemption is of no avail. On a fast day, decreed by the
community, redemption is also of no avail, unless the community made
such a stipulation.
13

If you made a vow to fast on Monday, Thursday and Monday, you may
change it to fasting on Thursday, Monday and Thursday, but not to any
other days (of the week), for it is presumed, that you had these days in
mind, because they are the days when the court is in session.

14

If you fast on Monday, Thursday, and Monday following Pesach and
Sukkos, as well as on the Aseres yemei teshuvah, [the Ten Days of
Penitence], and you did not commit yourself to fast during Minchah,
but your fasting is motivated by the custom, even if you had in mind to
fast, when responding Amein to the Mi shebeirach, as long as you did
not resolve to fast during Minchah, then, if there is a bris [circumcision]
or a pidyon haben [redemption of first born male] or any other meal
celebrating a mitzvah, you are fulfilling a mitzvah by eating, and you
need not absolve your vows, for whoever fasts on these days is following
the rules imposed by custom, and this custom of fasting was not
intended in regard to a meal in celebration of a mitzvah.

15

In cases, where you are permitted to eat at a meal celebrating a mitzvah,
the fast is, thereby, ended altogether, and you may eat afterwards, even
in your own house; but before the festive meal, it is forbidden to eat.
Only the father of the infant on the day of the bris and the sandak may
eat even before the meal, since to them it is like a Yom Tov.




16


However, if you ate on a fast day in violation of the law, whether
inadvertently or intentionally, you must complete the fast, even after
having eaten. Afterwards, you must fast on Monday, Thursday and
Monday, as an atonement for eating on the fast day. It is certainly true
that you must fulfil your vow at a later time if you had to fast because
of a vow you had made.

17

If you fast because of personal trouble, and the trouble passed, or if you
fast for a sick person, and that person recovered or died, you must
complete all the fast days that you committed yourself to observe. If
someone accepted upon himself to fast or to do some other mitzvah
until his son becomes Bar Mitzvah, and the son died before that time,
he must, nevertheless, fulfill his vow until the time his son would have
become Bar Mitzvah. However, if you find out that before you
committed yourself to fast, the cause for fasting had already passed and
your commitment, thus, was made in error, then you are not required
to complete it.

18

Fasting is beneficial when accompained with repentance for nullifying
the portents of a bad dream, just as fire consumes the refuse of flax; but
only if [you fast] on the day [you had the dream]. However, you are not
required to fast, for (the Amora) Samuel said: ""Dreams speak
falsehood,"" (Maseches Berachos 55b ). You are, however, required to
repent and to devote the entire day to the study of Torah and in prayer.
Concerning fasting on Shabbos for a worrisome dream, see Orach
Chaim, chapter 288.

[The days] from Rosh Chodesh Elul until after Yom Kippur, are days of
Divine favor [and acceptance.] Even though throughout the entire year
the Holy One, blessed is He, accepts the repentance of those who
return to Him wholeheartedly, nevertheless, these days are unexcelled
and most suitable for repentance, because they are days of mercy and
favor. On Rosh Chodesh Elul, Moshe went up Mount Sinai to receive
the Second Tablets; he remained there for forty days, and came down
on the tenth day of Tishrei when the atonement was completed. From
then on these days have been designated as days of Divine favor [and
acceptance,] and the tenth day of Tishrei as Yom Kippur [Day of
Atonement]. In most communities it is the custom to fast on the day
before Rosh Chodesh Elul and to recite the prayers of Yom Kippur Katan
[minor Yom Kippur], in order to be spiritually prepared for repentance.
If Rosh Chodesh occurs on Shabbos, Yom Kippur Katan is held on the
preceding Thursday. The Ari (Rabbi Yitzchak Luria), of blessed
memory, wrote, ""If he did not lie in ambush but Hashem made it
happen, then I will provide …"" (Exodus 21:13 ) The initials of the words
[ina le'yado vesamti lecha] form the acronym Elul, to indicate that this
month is a favorable time for repentance to be accepted for the sins
committed during the entire year. It also alludes to the fact that sins
done inadvertently also require repentance during this month. The
interpreters of allusions also commented: It is written (Deuteronomy
30:6 ) ""And Hashem your God will circumcise your heart and the heart

of your children;"" the initials of the words [es levavecho ve'es levav] form
the acronym Elul. Also, the initials of Ani ledodi vedodi li, [""I am my
Beloved's and my Beloved is mine,""] [Song of Songs 6:3 ] form the
acronym Elul. Also, the initials of Ish lerei'eihu umatanos la'evyonim
[""One to another and gifts to the poor""] (Esther 9:22 ) form the




acronym Elul. These acronyms are an allusion to three things:
Repentance, Prayer and Charity which must be practiced zealously
during this month. ""Hashem will circumcise etc."" alludes to
repentance, ""I am my Beloved's etc."" alludes to prayer, for prayer is the
song of love. ""One to another and gifts to the poor,"" alludes to charity.
2

It is customary to blow the shofar during this month. Beginning the
second day of Rosh Chodesh, we blow the shofar each day after the
Shacharis prayer, tekiah, shevarim, teruah, tekiah, except on erev Rosh
Hashanah, when the blowing is discontinued, in order to make a
distinction between the voluntary blowing of the shofar and the
blowing shofar in fulfillment of the mitzvah. The reason for blowing the
shofar during this month is to arouse the people to repent; for the shofar
sound has the quality to stir [the emotions] and to inspire fear, as
Scripture says, (Amos 3:6 ) ""If a shofar is sounded in a city will the
people not tremble?"" It is also the custom in our regions, beginning
with the second day of Rosh Chodesh Elul until Shemini Atzeres, to recite
Psalm [27] LeDovid Hashem ori ve'yish'i [""Of David, Hashem is my

light and my salvation""] [each day] [after] the morning and evening
prayers, This is based on the Midrash: ""Hashem is my light"" —on Rosh
Hashanah; ""and my salvation"" —on Yom Kippur; ""for He will hide me
in His shelter"" —alludes to Sukkos. It also is customary for the
congregation to recite Psalms, each locality according to its custom.
Beginning with the month of Elul until Yom Kippur, when you write a
letter to your friend you should mention, either at the beginning or at
the end that you pray for him and bless him to be worthy during the
forthcoming Days of Judgment to be inscribed and sealed in the Book
of Good Life.




3


Pious men are accustomed to examine their tefillin and mezuzos during
this month; and wherever any defect may be found in other mitzvohs,
to repair it.

4

Beginning with the Shabbos following Tishah beAv and after that, for
the next seven Shabbosos we read the haftoras ""sheva denechamasa""
[seven haftoras of consolation]. If the first day of Rosh Chodesh Elul
occurs on Shabbos, the haftorah, Aniyah so'arah, is set aside [""O you
afflicted, floundering in the storm,""] (Isaiah 54:11 ) and we read instead,
""Hashamayim kis'i,"" [The heaven is My throne] (Isaiah 66:1 ), because
this haftorah also contains consolation for Jerusalem. On the Shabbos of
Parshas Ki Seitzei, when the haftorah Roni akarah [Sing, O barren
woman] (Isaiah 54:1 ) is read, we conclude the haftorah with Aniyah
so'arah, which is next to it. If, by mistake, on Shabbos Rosh Chodesh
Elul, you said Aniyah so'arah, and you became aware of it before saying
the concluding berachos, you should also say Hashamayim kis'i, and
then say the concluding berachah. If you only became aware [of your
error] after saying the concluding berachos, then you should recite,
Hashamayim kis'i without the berachos. If Rosh Chodesh Elul occurs on
Sunday, the haftorah, Machar Chodesh is set aside, [Tomorrow is Rosh
Chodesh] (I Samuel 20:18 ), because it contains no consolation for
Jerusalem, and the haftorah Aniyah so'arah is read.

5

Beginning with the Sunday before Rosh Hashanah and thereafter we rise
early for Selichos, [special prayers for forgiveness]. If Rosh Hashanah
occurs on Monday or Tuesday, we begin [to say Selichos] from the
Sunday of the preceding week. When you get up early in the morning
[before daylight] you must wash your hands and say the berachah Al





netilas yadayim, [regarding washing the hands] and the berachah of the
Torah. After the Selichos [if it is daylight], you should wash your hands
again without saying a berachah.
6

The Chazzan who leads the Selichos prayers should put on a tallis with
tzitzis before saying Ashrei. Since it is doubtful, whether a berachah
should be said when putting on his own tallis at night or not, therefore,
the Chazzan should take neither his own tallis nor one belonging to the
congregation, but should borrow one from someone. If no tallis is
available, he may say Selichos and the Shelosh esrei midos [""The thirteen
attributes""] without wearing a tallis. It is customary in some
communities that the Chazzan who leads the Selichos prayers should
also officiate at the Shacharis and Minchah services, as well as at the
Maariv service of the preceding night. He takes precedence over a
mourner, a mohel, and a person observing yahrzeit. It is proper to stand
while saying the Selichos, but a person who finds it difficult to stand
should at least stand while saying keil melech yosheiv [""God, King Who
is enthroned""] etc. and the Shelosh esrei midos [""Thirteen attributes of
mercy""]. For the laws regarding the recitation of the Viduy (the
confession of sins, the Al cheit), see Chapter 131:9 below.

7

[The congregation] should be discriminating to choose as Chazzan to
lead the services of Selichos and the Yomim Noraim [Rosh Hashanah and
Yom Kippur] a man who is highly respectable, a Torah scholar, known
for his good deeds. He should be no less than thirty years old, for by
then moderation has calmed his youthful hot-bloodedness, and his
heart is subdued. He should also be married and have children, so that
he will pour out his heart and pray for mercy from the bottom of his
heart. [The congregation] should also be discriminating in selecting as





the tokei'a —the person who blows the shofar on Rosh Hashanah, —and
as the person who prompts him, men who are Torah scholars and Godfearing. However, any Jew is eligible to officiate at any religious
function, provided he is acceptable to the congregation. But if you see
that your appointment will cause quarreling you should withdraw, even
though an unworthy person will be chosen.
8

During the twelve months of mourning for a father or mother, a person
should not officiate as Chazzan on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur,
neither should he blow the shofar on Rosh Hashanah, unless there is no
one else as qualified as he is. If he is in the first thirty days [of
mourning] for other relatives, then, if he regularly officiated in previous
years as Chazzan or as tokei'a, he is permitted to do so [now] because
Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur cancel the thirty day mourning period,
but if he is not the regular Chazzan, and there is someone else as
qualified as he is, we are stringent [and do not permit him to officiate].
But during the period when we say Selichos, even on erev Rosh
Hashanah, any mourner may act as Chazzan, but not during the shivah
[the first seven days of mourning].

9

A person who says Selichos privately is not permitted to recite the
""Thirteen Attributes of mercy"" as a prayer or as a plea, but as if he were
reading them from the Torah, with the appropriate cantillation chant.
Wherever there is mention made of the ""Thirteen Attributes,"" such as,
""And remember for us this day the covenant of the thirteen
[attributes],"" and similar passages, he should omit them. Also the
supplications that are written in the Aramaic language, such as, Machei
umasei [He strikes and He heals] etc., and Maran di vishemeya [Master
in heaven] etc. should only be said with a minyan.




10


A mourner [during the shiva] is forbidden to leave his house to go to
the synagogue in order to say Selichos, except on erev Rosh Hashanah,
when many Selichos are said.

11

The Chazzan who will officiate on the ""Days of Awe"", as well as the
tokei'a, should abstain three days before Rosh Hashanah from anything
that may cause tum'ah —(impurity). They should study the meaning of
the prayers and the special liturgical poems and the laws concerning the
blessing of the shofar to the best of their ability. They should also study
books on devoutness and ethics that arouse man's heart to fear God
and the splendor of His grandeur when He rises to judge the world. If
the congregation is unable to find a tokei'a who is a Torah scholar, they
should at least see to it that the prompter is a Torah scholar, well versed
in the laws of the blowing of the shofar, so that if an error is made in
the sounds of the shofar, he should know what to do; and he should
also know how to examine the shofar to determine if it is fit to be used.

12

Many people are accustomed to fast during the Ten Days of Penitence,
but since this period includes four days on which fasting is not
permitted, namely, the two days of Rosh Hashanah, Shabbos, and erev
Yom Kippur, they make up for them by fasting four of the Selichos days
before Rosh Hashanah, that is, the first day of Selichos, erev Rosh
Hashanah and two other intervening days, preferably Monday and
Thursday. If a meal that is considered a mitzvah occurs [on one of these
days] they are permitted to eat at the meal and compensate by fasting
on another day. If they know beforehand that they are invited to a meal
celebrating a mitzvah, they should fast the day before [the meal], to
make up for it.




13


It is customary to go to the cemetery erev Rosh Hashanah after the
Shacharis prayers and bow prayerfully at the graves of tzaddikim
[righteous men]. Charity should be given to the poor, and many fervent
supplications offered to arouse the saintly tzaddikim, in their eternal
resting place to intercede for us on the Day of Judgement. An
additional reason for going to the cemetery is that the place where
tzaddikim are buried is sacred and pure, and prayers are more readily
accepted when they are offered on sacred ground, and the Holy One,
blessed is He, will show us kindness for the sake of the tzaddikim. But
it should not be your intention to appeal to the dead who rest there, for
that would be tantamount to ""Inquiring of the dead,"" (Deuteronomy
18:11 ), which is forbidden, but you should ask of Hashem, blessed is

His name, to have mercy on you for the sake of the tzaddikim who rest
in the dust. When you arrive at the cemetery, if you have not seen
graves within the past thirty days, you must say the berachah: Asher
yatzar eschem badin [Who has formed you in judgement etc.] (see
Chapter 60:11. above) When you approach the grave, you should say,
""May it be Your will, that the repose of [so-and-so] who is buried here,
be in peace, and may his merit aid me."" When placing your hand on
the grave, the left hand only should be placed, —not the right hand.
You should recite the verse, ""Hashem will always guide you, and satisfy
your soul with splendor, and make your bones strong, you will be like a
watered garden and like a spring of water whose water will not fail.""
(Isaiah 58:11 ) ""May you lie in peace, and may you sleep in peace until
Menachem (the Comforter, Moshiach) comes, announcing peace.""
(When placing your hand [on the grave] you should have in mind the
verse, ""Hashem will always guide you,"" which contains fifteen words
the same as the number of joints in the hands.) You should not visit the




same grave twice on the same day. Reading the inscription on a
headstone, if it is protruding, causes forgetfulness. A remedy for that is
to say the prayer Ahavah rabbah (With abundant love) up to
uleyachedcha be'ahavah [and to proclaim Your Oneness with love].
14

On erev Rosh Hashanah it is the universal custom to fast until after
Minchah, at which time you may eat something so that you do not
welcome the Yom Tov in a state of affliction. The entire day should be
spent learning Torah, performing mitzvos and in repentance, especially
of sins committed against your fellow man. You should not wait until
erev Yom Kippur, but, promptly, without delay, you should ask
forgiveness of your friends, [neighbors, and family.]

15

You should bathe and have your hair cut on erev Rosh Hashanah in
honor of Yom Tov. You should have your haircut before midday. You
should immerse yourself in the mikvah. We wear our Shabbos clothes
on Rosh Hashanah, to indicate that we trust in the kindness of Hashem,
blessed is His Name, to bring forth our judgement as a shining light.

16

It is customary to do hataras nedarim [to annul certain vows] on erev
Rosh Hashanah. (An allusion [for this can be found in the words] Lo
yacheil devaro kechol, [He must not break his word (Numbers 30:3 )]; the
last letters of which form the acronym Elul.) A person who does not
understand what he is reciting in Hebrew, should say it in the language
he understands.
"
"



1


In all the kaddish prayers recited from Rosh Hashanah through Yom
Kippur, you should repeat the word le'eila [He is higher]; thus you
should say le'eila le'eila, [He is exceedingly higher], (without adding the
vav, ule'eila). Since the kaddish must contain twenty-eight words [from
yehei shemei rabba until be'alema] and the entire year you say le'eila min
kol birchasa [He is beyond any blessing], you say now le'eila le'eila mikol
birchasa.

2

Some people have the custom when praying on Rosh Hashanah and
Yom Kippur [to pray] every Shemoneh esrei with their bodies bent and
their heads bowed. However, since you must bow at the berachah,
Magein Avraham [Shield of Abraham] and Modim [we give thanks], at
the beginning and at the end, therefore, before reaching these berachos
it is necessary to straighten up in order to bow as required by our Sages
of blessed memory. It is also forbidden to bow at the beginning and at
the end of any berachah that was not instituted by our Sages of blessed
memory. It is best [therefore] to pray while standing erect, but with a
humble heart and with tears. The practice of praying in a loud voice
should be abolished, because you should pray quietly as you do the
entire year. Some authorities permit to raise the voice slightly, but not
too much. You should be careful to pronounce your prayers correctly;
not to change even one vowel. You should try to obtain a Siddur or
Machzor that is carefully edited, from which to pray.

3

All through the year you say in the Shemoneh Esrei, hakeil hakadosh [the
Almighty, the Holy One], and melech oheiv tzedakah umishpat [King
Lover of righteousness and justice] except from Rosh Hashanah until
after Yom Kippur, when you must say instead Hamelech hakadosh (the





King, the Holy One) and Hamelech hamishpat (the King of Justice),
because on these days the Holy One blessed is He manifests His
dominion by judging the world. If, by mistake, you said Hakeil
hakadosh, or if you are in doubt whether you said Hakeil hakadosh or
Hamelech hakadosh; if you become aware of the error within the time
needed to utter a short greeting, [Shalom Alecha Rebbe] you should say
Hamelech hakadosh and you need not start again from the beginning.
The same law applies to Hamelech hamishpat. But, if you only became
aware of it after the time needed for a short greeting, then, at Hamelech
hakadosh you must repeat Shemoneh Esrei from the beginning, (even if
in doubt), because the first three berachos are considered as one (as is
written in Chapter 19:2). Even the Chazzan during the repetition of
the Shemoneh Esrei, must repeat from the beginning [if he did not say
Hamelech hakadosh], and the kedusha must be said again. But at
Hamelech hamishpat, even an individual need not repeat, even that
berachah, since he mentioned the word melech ""King"" in that berachah.
During the entire year, if you said, by mistake, Hamelech hakadosh or
Hamelech hamishpat, you need not repeat the Shemoneh Esrei.
4

In the Maariv service on Friday night, in the abridged form of the
seven berachos, in Magein avos (Shield of our forefathers etc.) you also
say, instead of Hakeil hakadosh the words Hamelech hakadosh. If the
Chazzan made an error and said Hakeil hakadosh, then, if he becomes
aware of it immediately, within the time span needed for a short
greeting, he should say Hamelech hakadosh etc.; but if he becomes aware
of it later he need not repeat the berachah.

If you forgot to say Zochreinu [Remember us], or Mi chamocha [Who is
like You], or Uchsov [And inscribe], or Beseifer chayim [In the book of





life] and you do not become aware of it until you said Baruch ata
Hashem, [Blessed are You, Hashem], since you mentioned Hashem, you
should conclude the berachah, and continue the Shemoneh Esrei, and
you need not repeat it. Similarly, if you forgot to say [the entire section
beginning with] Uvechein tein pachdecha [And so, grant that Your awe]
and you concluded the berachah, Hamelech hakadosh, even if you only
said Baruch ata Hashem, you should conclude Hamelech hakadosh, and
then say Ata vechartanu [You have chosen us] etc.
6

At the conclusion of the Shemoneh esrei, some are accustomed to say
Oseh ha shalom [He Who makes the peace], while others do not change,
and say [the usual text], Hamevareich es amo Yisrael ba shalom, [Who
blesses His people Israel with peace]. But in the kaddish, we say Ose ha
shalom bimeromav [He Who makes the peace in His high heavens.]

7

If Rosh Hashanah occurs on Shabbos, in some communities they say
Lechu neranenah [Come, let us sing], the same as on any other Shabbos;
in other communities they begin with Mizmor leDovid [A psalm of
David]; still in other communities they begin with Mizmor shir leyom
haShabbos [A Psalm, a song for the Shabbos day]. Every community
should follow its custom.

8

After the Maariv service on the first night of Rosh Hashanah, it is
customary for people to wish each other Leshanah tovah tikaseiv
veseichaseim [May you be inscribed and sealed for a good year], and to a
woman [you use the feminine form] tikaseivi veseichaseimi. But you do
not extend these wishes in the daytime, because the writing has been
finished before midday. On the second night, some have the custom of





saying [Leshanah tovah] because sometimes we are judged on the second
day.
9

At the evening meal it is customary to prepare symbolic dishes [as
auspicious omens] for a good year: you dip the piece of challah of
Hamotzi in honey, and after eating a kazayis of challah you should say:
Yehi ratzon shetechadeish aleinu shanah tovah umesukah [May it be Your
will to renew for us a good and sweet year]. After this you should dip a
piece of apple in honey, say the berachah, Borei peri ha'eitz, and eat it.
Then you say again Yehi ratzon etc. It is customary to eat the head of an
animal and say Yehi ratzon shenih'yeh lerosh [May it be Your will] that
we will be heads (leaders). You should try to obtain the head of a sheep,
which will also serve as a remembrance of the ram of Isaac. You should
also eat vegetables the names of which, in the language of your country,
allude to good things, such as in our country, carrots (mehren) [mehren
means to increase] and you should say Yehi ratzon sheyirbu zechuyoseinu
[May it be Your will that our merits increase.] Some people have the
custom to eat an elaborate fish course, symbolizing the blessing of
fertility like the fish. The fish should not be cooked in vinegar because
we must not eat sour or bitter foods on Rosh Hashanah. You should eat
choice meats and all kinds of sweets. It is also customary not to eat nuts
mucus which interferes with praying. It is proper to study Torah during
the meal. Some have the custom of studying the Mishnah, Maseches
Rosh Hashanah.

10

It is proper to abstain from marital relations during the two nights of
Rosh Hashanah even if [the first night] occurs on Shabbos. But if it is





the night of her immersion in the mikvah, you should not withold her
conjugal rights, and you should immerse yourself in the mikvah, in the
morning.
11

On Rosh Hashanah, when you say Avinu malkeinu chatanu lefanecha
[Our Father, our King, we have sinned before You] you should not beat
your breast as on weekdays and on Yom Kippur, because we do not say
vidui —confession, on Rosh Hashanah, which is a Yom Tov. You should
have this interpretation in mind [when saying Avinu malkeinu]: Our
Father, our King, we have sinned before You, meaning, our forefathers
sinned before You, because they worshiped idols, but as for us, we have
no King but You. Therefore, our Father, our King, deal [kindly] with us
for Your Name's sake.

12

When the Seifer Torah is removed from the Ark, it is customary to recite
the Thirteen Attributes. You should begin with Vaya'avor [and He
passed by], and say Vaya'avor Hashem al panav vayikra [Hashem passed
by before him and He proclaimed] Hashem, Hashem, etc. On Shabbos,
in some communities they say neither the Thirteen Attributes nor
Ribbono shel olam [Master of the Universe].

13

The lengths of the various shofar tones, initially must be as follows: the
Teruah consists of nine short sounds. The Shevarim should be blown as
three consecutive sounds, each to be as long as three short Teruah
sounds, so that the Shevarim is also equal to nine sounds. You should be
very careful not to draw out the Shevarim until each [of the three]
Shevarim sounds equals nine Teruah sounds, for in that case, even ex
post facto, after it is already done, you have not fulfilled your duty. The
Tekios are simple blasts. In the order of Tekiah, Shevarim, Teruah,





Tekiah, each Tekiah should be as long as the Shevarim and the Teruah,
combined, which is as long as eighteen sounds. In the order of Tekiah,
Shevarim, Tekiah, the sound of each Tekiah should be as long as the
Shevarim, which is as long as nine sounds; this is also true for the order
of Tekiah, Teruah, Tekiah. In the sounding of the shofar before the
Musaf service the Shevarim and the Teruah should be blown in one
breath. Therefore, the prompter should call them at the same time,
Shevarim-Teruah. In the blowing of the shofar during the repetition of
the Shemoneh Esrei, they should be sounded in two breaths.
Nevertheless, there should be no pause between them, but they should
be sounded in immediate succession, and the prompter should also call
them at the same time.
14

When the one blowing the shofar recites the berachos, the congregation
should not respond Baruch hu uvaruch shemo [Blessed is He and blessed
is His Name] (see chapter 6:8, above), but they should listen attentively
to the berachos and after each berachah they should respond Amein,
with concentration. It is forbidden to make any interruption from that
point until after all the Tekios that are blown during the repetition of
the Shemoneh Eesrei. Therefore, the Shammos should not announce:
""Silence please during the services!"" even if he usually does so at other
times.

15

People have the custom to recite Yehi ratzon [May it be the will] etc.,
between the three sets of shofar tones, as it is printed in the Machzor.
You should be very careful not to articulate the names of the angels
mentioned there. In many communities the Yehi ratzon is omitted
entirely, and this is preferable. The main [reason for blowing the shofar]
is to stir the people to wholehearted repentance. The Rambam, of





blessed memory wrote, (Laws of Repentance 3:4) and these are his
words: ""Although the blowing of the shofar on Rosh Hashanah, is
ordained by Scriptural verse, it has an underlying message, as if the
shofar were telling us, 'Wake up from your sleep, you slumberers, and
you who are soundly asleep, awake from your deep sleep, scrutinize
your deeds and repent, and remember your Creator. You, who are
oblivious of the truth in your futile pursuit of transitory values, and
engrossed all your years in the pursuit of vain and hollow things that
are useless and will not save you, — look at the state of your souls, and
improve your ways and your deeds. Let each of you abandon his evil
ways and his thoughts which are not good.'""
16

During the repetition of the Shemoneh Esrei when the Chazzan recites
[the prayer] Va'anachnu kore'im [But we bow], it is customary for the
congregation to say it along with him, and the people also bow and
prostrate themselves, but they do not fall on their faces, except on Yom
Kippur, during the Avodah [the service of the Kohein gadol.] The
Chazzan also bows, but since he is forbidden to move from his place
during the Shemoneh Esrei; therefore, he stands slightly removed from
the amud [Chazzan's desk] so that he can fall to his knees without
moving from his place, and those who stand near him help him stand
up so that he will not have to move his feet. The Tekios during the
repetition of the Shemoneh Esrei should not be blown by the Chazzan
unless he is sure that he will not be confused [in his prayers] as a result
of it.

17

Regarding the Tekios in the repetition of the Shemoneh Esrei, there are
different customs regarding the number of sounds to be blown. Each
community should maintain its custom. Regarding the Tekios at the





conclusion of the prayers, there are also different customs. After the
conclusion of all the Tekios, according to the local custom, the shofar
should be hidden, and it should not be blown any more. Even a person
wishing to officiate as tokei'a on the second day of Rosh Hashanah may
not blow it on the first day in order to practice.
18

If a bris is to be held in the synagogue it should be performed after the
reading of the haftarah, before the blowing of the shofar. An allusion [to
this sequence can be found in the Selichos prayer] ""Remember the
covenant with Abraham (this refers to bris milah) and the binding of
Isaac"" (this alludes to the shofar). On Shabbos the bris is performed
after Ashrei. If the bris must be performed at the house of the infant's
mother, it should be held after leaving the synagogue.

19

If you already fulfilled your obligation of blowing the shofar, and you
must blow it for other people, you may also say the berachos.
Nevertheless, it is best, that the person who has to fulfill his obligation
[by virtue of listening to you blowing the shofar], should say the
berachos himself. If you blow shofar for women, then, if you already
fulfilled your obligation, you should not say the berachos, but the
women should say the berachos, because, according to the law, women
are exempt from blowing the shofar, since it is a positive precept
dependent on a particular time. Other authorities say that a person who
has already fulfilled his duty should not blow the shofar at all for
women. If you wish to blow the shofar for women you should do it
before hearing the Tekios at the synagogue; and you should say the
berachos on the Tekios with the intention of fulfilling your obligation
thereby, but you should not do it during the first three hours of the day,
for at that time you may not blow the shofar privately. You should





either blow the shofar for the women at the time it is blown in the
synagogue or after that; but you should have in mind [when you are in
the synagogue] not to fulfill your duty with these Tekios but only with
the Tekios which you will sound for the women, and [on these Tekios]
you should say the berachos. Although you will go to the synagogue
afterwards to pray Musaf, and hear the Tekios sounded during the
Shemoneh Esrei, the interruption does not require you to repeat the
berachos, since all the Tekios constitute one mitzvah. If a woman feels
weak and needs to eat before the Tekios, she is permitted to eat.
20

When leaving the synagogue, we should walk unhurried and relaxed,
happy and cheerful, confident that God has heard our prayers and the
sounds of the shofar with compassion. You should eat and drink [in
generous measure] enjoying the bountiful gifts of God. You should,
nevertheless, take care not to overeat and the fear of God should be
upon you. It is proper to study Torah at the table. After saying Birkas
Hamazon you should not go to sleep, but rather go to the synagogue
and recite Psalms with the congregation until the Minchah service.
Only a person who has a headache may sleep a little before going to the
synagogue.

21

After the Minchah service you should go to a river [or stream] (to recall
the merit of the Akeidah, [the binding of Yitzchak] for the Midrash
relates that when our Father Avraham went to the Akeidah with his son
Yitzchak, Satan transformed himself into a river to deter him. But our
Father Avraham, peace be upon him, walked into the river until [the
water reached] his neck and said, ""Deliver me, O God, for the waters
have reached until my soul."" (Psalm 69:2 ) There is another reason [for
this custom]; for on this day we proclaim the kingship of the Holy





One, blessed is He, over us, and it was the custom to anoint kings near
a river bank as a sign that their kingdom may endure without end.) It is
preferable that [this river] should be outside the city limits and it
should contain fish (as a reminder that we are compared to living fish
who are caught in a net. We too, are caught in the net of death and
judgment, and as a result [we will be inclined] to think more of
repenting. Another reason is to symbolize that the evil eye shall have no
power over us, just as [it has no power] over fish, and that we may be
fruitful and multiply as the fish. Others say the reason is that fish have
no eyelids, and their eyes are always open, the purpose is thus to arouse
the compassion of the All-Seeing Eye above us.) But if there is no river
that contains fish you may go to any river, or to a well, and you should
recite the verses, Mi keil kamocha [Who, Almighty, is like you] etc. as it
is written in the prayer books in the text of Tashlich. You should then
shake the ends of your clothes, symbolizing your resolve to cast away
your sins, and to examine and scrutinize your ways, from now on; so
that your ""clothes"" will be white and innocent of all sin. If the first day
of Rosh Hashanah is on Shabbos you go [to the stream for Tashlich] on
the second day.
22

After returning to the synagogue, if it is not yet time for Maariv you
should avoid the company of friends in order not to engage, Heaven
forbid, in idle talk. But you should study Torah or recite Psalms or
study books on ethics, because this is a holy day unto our Master.

23

The two days of Rosh Hashanah are considered as one long day, and as
one [extended period of ] holiness (see Chapter 99:2 above). Therefore,
the authorities differ whether in the Kiddush of the second night, or
when lighting candles, or when blowing the shofar on the second day,





you should say the berachah Shehecheyanu or not. For some authorities
say, since both days are one [extended period of ] holiness and you
already said Shehecheyanu on the first day, you need not say it again on
the second day. Therefore, it is the custom, when you recite the Kiddush
on the second night, that a new fruit is placed on the table, in order
that the Shehecheyanu in the Kiddush should also apply to the fruit; You
might also put on a new garment. If you have neither [a new fruit nor a
new suit], it does not matter; you should still say Shehecheyanu in the
Kiddush, for the Halachah is decided according to the authorities who
say that we must say Shehecheyanu on the second night. A woman, too,
when lighting the candles on the second night, (if she follows the
custom of saying Shehecheyanu,) should nevertheless, put on a new
garment if possible, or place a new fruit [on the table], so that the
Shehecheyanu should apply also to these. But if she has neither of these
it does not matter; she should still say Shehecheyanu. Also the person
who blows the shofar on the second day should, if possible, put on a
new garment. However, if the first day occurs on Shabbos there is no
need for this, for he has not yet said Shehecheyanu on the shofar.

The Ten Days of Repentance, as characterized by their name, are
designated for repentance. During this time everyone is obligated to
repent wholeheartedly before God, blessed is His Name, before the
coming of the great and awesome day, of Yom Kippur, as it is said,
""Before God you will be cleansed"" (Leviticus 16:30 ). It is also said,
""Seek God when He may be found"", (Isaiah 55:6 ) and our Rabbis of
blessed memory said, that this refers to the ten days between Rosh





Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Therefore, during these days you must
examine your conduct and repent of your bad deeds. Sins about which
you are in doubt require greater repentance than transgressions of
which you are certain, for a person is more regretful when he knows
that he committed a sin, than when he is uncertain of it. Therefore, the
guilt offering brought in case of doubtful sin must be of greater value
than a regular sin offering. During these days You should study more
Torah, perform more mitzvohs, give more charity, and spend less time
on your business. It was written by Rabbi Moshe Cordovero, of blessed
memory, that you should consider these days as if they were Chol
Hamoed, by performing only necessary work. Above all, you must set
right the wrongs you committed against your fellow man, for which
there is no atonement unless you compensate him for any stolen articles
or withheld funds in your possession, and patch things up and placate
him so that he will forgive you.
2

It is proper to observe stringencies during these days that you do not
observe the rest of the year, for we also ask of God, blessed is His
Name, that He deal with us with exceptional kindness. For example, if
during the rest of the year, you eat bread from a non-Jewish bakery,
during these days you should eat only bread baked by a Jew; and you
should observe similar stringencies.

3

When reciting Birkas Hamazon, there are some who have the custom of
saying Harachaman hu yechadeish [the Compassionate One, may He
renew] etc. as we do on Rosh Hashanah.

4

It is customary not to get married during these days.




5


On Shabbos Shuvah [the Shabbos during the Ten Days of Repentance]
an eminent person should be called up for maftir.

6

Some people have the custom not to sanctify the moon before the
conclusion of Yom Kippur, for then everybody is joyful, whereas before
Yom Kippur they are apprehensive about the outcome of their judgment
Others maintain that, on the contrary, it is better to sanctify the moon
before Yom Kippur in order to add to our merits with this mitzvah. It all
depends on the prevailing custom. In a region where esrogim, lulavim
and hadassim are for sale, it is the custom of pious men to purchase
them ahead of time, so that during these days this precious mitzvah
may be added to their merits.
"
"1

It is customary to perform the kapparos ritual erev Yom Kippur, early in
the morning, for then God's compassion is at its height. Men take
roosters and women take hens, and a pregnant woman takes a rooster
and a hen. The rooster is taken in case she is carrying a male; and if the
child is a girl, one hen suffices for the mother and the child. Even for
other people, one kapparah is sufficient for two persons. You should
select white chickens, for it is said, ""Though your sins will be like
scarlet they will become white as snow."" (Isaiah 1:18 ). But when
buying, you should not express preference for white fowl and pay a
higher price for it, for this resembles the customs of the Amorites
[superstition]. But if you happen to find a white one among the fowl
you bought, you should choose [the white one.] You take the kapparah
in your right hand, and recite the verses Benei Adam [children of man]





etc., move it around your head, and say: Zeh chalifasi [This is instead of
me] etc. three times. If you move it around someone else's head, you
say Zeh chalifasecha [This is instead of you]. You should first move it
around your own head and then do it for others. It is preferable that the
shechitah is done also early in the morning, immediately after the
kapparos ritual. You should not think that this kapparah ritual is an
actual atonement, but you should consider that what is done to the
fowl should be rightfully done to you, because of your sins. You should
agonize over your sins, and the Holy One blessed is He, in His
compassion, will accept your repentance. It is customary to throw the
intestines, the liver and the kidneys of the kapparos, on the roof or into
the courtyard, where the birds can take them, for it is appropriate to
take pity on living creatures on that day, so that Heaven will take pity
on us. Another reason is that birds usually steal the seeds they eat [we,
therefore, throw away their digestive organs] so that we should be
mindful to keep away from theft. If you cannot obtain chickens for
kapparos, you can take a goose or some other living thing that is not
ritually acceptable as a sacrifice on the altar in the Beis Hamikdash.
Some authorities say that even fish [may be used], but not pigeons or
young doves, because these were acceptable as altar sacrifices, and it
would appear as if you were bringing sacrifices outside the Beis
Hamikdash [which is forbidden]. Some people follow the custom of
giving the kapparos chickens to the poor, but it is better to redeem the
kapparos with money, and give the money to the poor.
2

We do not say Mizmor lesodah [a Psalm of thanksgiving], nor
Tachanun, nor Lamenatzei'ach on erev Yom Kippur. Neither do we recite
Avinu malkeinu [our Father, our King]. Only when Yom Kippur occurs





on Shabbos, do we say Avinu malkeinu on erev Yom Kippur in the
Shacharis service.
3

It is a mitzvah to have elaborate meals and to eat and drink
[abundantly]. The person who eats and drinks on erev Yom Kippur in
order to fulfill this mitzvah, it is regarded to him, as if he fasted on that
day also. It is a mitzvah to eat fish at the first meal.

4

Sins committed against your fellow man are not atoned for on Yom
Kippur unless you placate him, as it is said, ""You will be cleansed of all
your sins before God."" This means, only sins against God are atoned
for on Yom Kippur, but sins committed against your neighbor are not
atoned for on Yom Kippur, unless you placate your neighbor. Everyone
must, therefore, be very careful, if he has in his possession illegally
acquired property, to return it and placate [the rightful owner]. If you
are holding property of which you are not certain whether or not it
legally belongs to you, you should let your neighbor know that you
wish to appear with him, immediately after Yom Kippur, before a Beis
Din Rabbinical court to be judged according to the holy Torah; and
you should firmly resolve to abide by the verdict pronounced by the
Beis Din. If you sinned against your neighbor, even if only with words,
you must appease him. It is your duty to go personally to appease him.
However, if it is difficult for you to do so, or if you understand that he
will be reconciled more easily through an intermediary, you should
appease him through an intermediary. The person whose forgiveness is
asked should forgive wholeheartedly and should not be ruthless, for this
is not a Jewish characteristic, but a trait of Esau of whom it is said,
""And he kept his anger forever"" (Amos 1:11 ). It is also said of the
Gibeonites, because they did not forgive and would not be appeased,





""The Gibeonites were not of the Children of Israel."" (II Samuel 21:2 )
The characteristic of the Children of Israel is to be slow to anger and
easy to be appeased. And when the sinner asks for forgiveness you
should grant forgiveness wholeheartedly and willingly. Even if he
tormented you a great deal you should not take revenge nor bear a
grudge. On the contrary, if the offender does not take the initiative to
come to you asking for forgiveness, you should present yourself to the
offender in order that [the offender] should ask your forgiveness. If a
person does not banish hatred [from his heart] on Yom Kippur, his
prayers will not be heard, God forbid; but if you are tolerant and
forgiving, all your sins will be forgiven.
5

If the wronged person has died, the offender should gather ten men at
his grave, and say, ""I have sinned against the God of Israel and against
this man"" and they respond, ""You are forgiven, you are forgiven, you
are forgiven."" He should walk barefoot, and spell out in detail the
nature of the offense, unless it is humiliating to the dead. If the grave is
more than three parsa away from the residence of the offender, he does
not have to go there in person, but may send a representative. The
representative should gather ten men to go to the grave, and say, ""I, the
agent of so-and-so publicly declare that so-and-so has sent me to ask
forgiveness for his sin,"" etc. If he insulted a dead person he does not
have to go to his grave, but he should ask for his forgiveness at the place
where he insulted him. But if he had defamed his character, he must
accept upon himself to repent, for transgressing the prohibition of the
early sages, against slandering the dead.

6

It is a mitzvah for every man to immerse in a mikvah on erev Yom
Kippur, to purify himself from nocturnal emission, and also as an





element of repentance, just as a convert is required to immerse in a
mikvah. Therefore, even boys and girls should immerse themselves in a
Mikvah. You should be certain that there is no chatzitzah on your body
[a particle intervening between the body and the water] (see Chapter
161 below). The most appropriate time for the immersion is after
midday. A woman after intercourse is likely to discharge semen within
three days. She is then considered as one who has had a nocturnal
emission, and the immersion is pointless in this case. The practical
thing for her to do, is before immersing, to wash herself well with warm
water; she will then experience no further discharge. However, if she
had intercourse soon after her monthly immersion in the mikvah, or
immediately before her menstrual period, when she is likely to become
pregnant, then she is forbidden to destroy the semen of conception,
and she should, therefore, not wash herself in warm water.
Nevertheless, she should immerse in cold water. A mourner, may the
Merciful One protect us, even during the first seven days of mourning,
may wash and immerse himself about one or two hours before
nightfall, even before the Minchah service, but all the other laws of
mourning, such as sitting on the floor, and not wearing [leather] shoes,
must be observed until nighttime.
7

It is the custom that every head of the household prepares a candle for
his house, as a reminder that on Yom Kippur Moshe came down from
Mount Sinai with the Second Tablets, of the Torah, and the Torah is
called ""light""; and he prepares another candle for the soul of his
deceased father and mother, to make atonement for them. It is
customary that one candle is lit in the house to burn until the close of
Yom Kippur, and Havdalah is said over it, (see Chapter 133:28 below)
and one candle is lit in the synagogue. These candles should not be





made out of wax taken from houses of idol worship. Some people
become upset if their candle is extinguished on Yom Kippur, although
in reality there is no reason to worry about this, still it is best to avoid
it. It is best therefore to give the candle to the shamash (sexton), who
will put it wherever he wishes, so that no one will know which is his
candle. You should take the candle to the synagogue, when you go there
for the Minchah service to be put in its proper place, and to be lit
before twilight, because later, when people come to the synagogue for
the Maariv service they are pressed for time.
8

When you go to the synagogue for the Minchah service it is the custom
to put on Shabbos clothes. In the Minchah service, at the conclusion of
the Shemnoneh Esrei, the Vidui [confessional] is said,. Before Elokai
netzor, [My God, guard my tongue] you say the verse, Yih'yu leratzon,
[May… they be acceptable] etc., and then you say, Elokeinu v'Elokei
avoseinu, [Our God and the God of our forefathers] tavo lefanecha [may
our prayer come before You], until vecholayim ra'im [or serious illness];
then you say Eloka netzor etc. and you repeat the verse Yih'yu leratzon.
If, while you are saying the Vidui the Chazzan is repeating the
Shemoneh Esrei, since you already said the verse Yih'yu leratzon, you
may respond Amein, and say the Kedusha and Modim, (see Chapter
18:14 above).

9

You must say the Vidui while standing in a bowed position, as when
you say Modim, and when mentioning each sin you should beat your
heart as if to say, ""You (the heart) caused me to sin. The order of the
Vidui, set down in the Siddur, should be said by all alike. If you are
aware of an individual sin not enumerated in the Vidui, since the Vidui
is recited in an undertone, you should specify that sin, and confess it





with a grieving heart, and profuse tears. If that sin is one that is
mentioned in the Vidui, then, when you come to it, you should burst
out in bitter self-reproach. Sins you confessed on the previous Yom
Kippur may be confessed again, although you know that you did not
commit them again, and you are to be praised for doing so, as it is said,
""And my sin is always before me."" (Psalms 51:15 )
10

After the Minchah prayer, Avinu Malkeinu is not recited, regardless if
Yom Kippur occurs on a weekday or on Shabbos.

11

After the Minchah service it is customary to receive [symbolic] lashes.
Although these lashes are not real lashes, nevertheless, it will inspire the
recipient to repent of his sins. A strap of calf's leather should be used,
even though it is less than a tefach wide. The one receiving the lashes
should bend down and kneel with his face towards the North and his
back towards the South. It is customary to recite confessions while
receiving the lashes. The one who administers the lashes says Vehu
rechum (He, the Merciful One) three times, which amounts to thirtynine words, analogous to the thirty-nine lashes.

12

Towards evening you eat the closing meal, and it is customary to dip
the piece of challah for Hamotzi in honey, just as you do on Rosh
Hashanah. You should eat only food that is easy to digest, such as fowl.
It is the custom not to eat fish at the meal. You should not eat or drink
anything that raises the body temperature, such as foods seasoned with
spices and saffron. You should be very careful to add from the secular to
the sacred, that is, you should end the meal while it is still day, a little
before twilight. The zealous finish their meal early, about an hour
before sunset. If you ended your meal while it is still the middle of the





day, and you intend to eat or drink after that, you must stipulate before
Birkas Hamazon and say explicitly, or at least have in mind that you do
not yet accept the fast on yourself.
13

It is the custom in these regions not to store food to warm on erev Yom
Kippur, to be used at the conclusion of Yom Kippur, as it is done on erev
Shabbos for Shabbos, because it is equivalent to preparing food on Yom
Kippur for the weekday; and it also gives the impression of gluttony.

14

It is written, (Issiah 58:13), ""The holy [day] of Hashem should be
honored"" and the Sages explain that this refers to Yom Kippur for on
that day there is no eating or drinking. It is a mitzvah to honor this day
with clean clothes and with candlelight. Therefore, in the synagogue we
spread beautiful covers and light many candles, which are called
""honor"", as it is said, ""Honor Hashem, ba'urim,"" (Isaiah 58:13 ) and the
Targum translated it, ""Honor Hashem with lights."" Before twilight, the
tables should be covered with cloths, and candles should be lit in the
house, as on erev Shabbos. A candle should be lit in the bedroom to
prevent the occurence of marital relations. Over the candles, the
berachah Lehadlik neir shel Yom haKippurim is said [to kindle the light
of Yom Kippur]. If Yom Kippur occures on Shabbos, the berachah,
Lehadlik Neir shel Shabbos and Yom Kippur is said. (Concerning the
berachah of Shehecheyanu see Chapter 103:4 above)

15

It is the custom to put on a kittel (white robe) which is a garment of the
dead. The wearing of such a garment causes the heart of man to be
subdued and broken. A mourner may also wear a kittel. Since it is a
garment that is worn only at prayer, you should not wear it in the
bathroom. Women, too, should wear clean, white clothes in honor of





the day; but they should not wear jewelry, because of the awe of
judgemnt.
16

It is customary for the father and mother to bless their sons and
daughters before going to the synagogue, because the holiness of the
day has already begun, and the Gates of Compassion are already open.
They implore in this blessing that the children should be sealed for
good life, and that their hearts be steadfast in the fear of God, and they
should plead, with tearful eyes, that their prayers be accepted. The
children will also be inspired and resolve to walk in the ways of the
righteous and follow the path of the just. Some people visit their
relatives who are Torah scholars and righteous men to receive blessings
from them, and ask them to pray for them on the holy and awesome
day. You should do this early, while it is still the middle of the day, for
towards evening everyone should be ready to receive the holy day in a
quiet and serene frame of mind. The text for blessing the children is:
Yesimecha [May God make you] etc., Yevarechecha [May God bless you]
etc., and everyone may add to this prayer according to his eloquence of
speech. It is proper to say also the following prayer: May it be the will
of our Father in heaven to place in your heart love and fear of Him, and
may the fear of God be upon your face all the days of your life, so that
you will not sin. May your desire be for Torah and mitzvos. May your
eyes look straightforward, may your mouth speak wisdom, and your
heart meditate with reverence. May your hands be engaged in the
performance of mitzvos; may your feet hasten to do the will of your
Father in heaven. May He grant you righteous sons and daughters
occupying themselves with Torah and mitzvos all their days. May your
wellspring be blessed, [May you be blessed with many children]. May
He grant that your livelihood, come with honesty, ease, and abundance,





from His generous hand, and not from the gifts of men; a livelihood
that will free you to serve God. May you be inscribed and sealed for a
good and long life among all the righteous of Israel. Amein.
17

It is customary to put on the tallis. You should be careful to put it on
while it is still day, and to say the berachah over it. But if you waited [to
put it on] until twilight you should not say the berachah.
"
"1

It is the custom in our regions before saying Kol nidrei that the most
eminent man of the congregation takes out a Seifer Torah [from the
Ark] and walks around the bimah with it and the people embrace and
kiss the Seifer Torah, and beg for pardon and forgiveness for having
offended the Torah. They resolve, from now on to live according to its
laws. They recite the verse Or zaru'a [Light is sown for the righteous]
etc. a number of times (Psalms 97:11 ). Then he places himself, with the
Seifer Torah, to the right of the Chazzan, and another prominent
member of the congregation stands on the Chazzan's left, also carrying
a Seifer Torah, and the three say together: Biyishivah shel malah [By the
authority of the Court on High] etc. The Chazzan then recites Kol
nidrei three times, in the familiar melody. All the congregants should
say it quietly along with the Chazzan. It is proper to begin Kol nidrei
while it is still day, and to draw it out until night. After the Chazzan
said Barechu and the congregation responded Baruch etc. the Torah
scrolls are returned to the Ark, [and the two men who carried them]
return to their seats. On Shabbos they may return to their seats when
the congregation recites Mizmor shir leyom haShabbos [a Psalm, a song
for the Shabbos day].




2


When the Chazzan says the berachah Shehecheyanu he should have in
mind to exempt the congregation. Nevertheless, each worshipper
should have in mind not to be exempted by the Chazzans's berachah,
but he should say the berachah quietly by himself, and say it quickly,
concluding it before the Chazzan, so that he can respond Amein. The
women who said the berachah Shehecheyanu when lighting candles, or a
man who lit the candles and said Shehecheyanu, should not say it with
the Chazzan.

3

On Yom Kippur, both in the evening and during the day, you should
say, Baruch sheim kevod malchuso le'olam va'ed, [Blessed [is His] Name,
Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever], in a loud voice.

4

Some people stand on their feet during the entire evening service and
the entire day of Yom Kippur. If they feel faint they may lean against
something. The reason for standing is to emulate the angels; therefore,
women should not stand. A person who has stood up once with the
intention to do so for the rest of his life, and afterwards wishes to
retract, needs an annulment [of his personal obligation].

5

Some people have the custom to stay in the synagogue reciting songs of
praise all night. When they feel the need to sleep they should move
away from the Ark. The Chazzanim should not stay awake for it will
cause them to lose their voice. Before going to sleep you should say the
first four Psalms, for they are particularly beneficial in preventing
nocturnal emission, may the Merciful One save us. For [these four
Psalms] contain a total of three hundred and six words. By adding four,
[to the number of the] Psalms, you arrive at a total of three hundred





emission]. [The numerical value] of the first and last letters of the four
Psalms amounts to one hundred and twenty-six, plus the four of the
four Psalms, plus one, the general binding factor which unites the
word, together makes a total of one hundred and thirty-one, the
in mind to shake off his evil influence. It is best not to cover yourself
with pillows and blankets that make you feel hot; but at any rate you
should not cover your legs.
"
"1

On Yom Kippur it is forbidden to eat, to drink, to wash, to anoint, to
wear shoes, and to have marital relations. It is forbidden to do any work
or to carry, just as on Shabbos. Since it is necessary to add from the
secular to the sacred, all of the above are forbidden [on erev Yom
Kippur] while it is still day, beginning a short time before twilight; and
at the end of Yom Kippur, until a short time after the stars appear.

2

Some authorities permit touching food or drink when it is necessary to
feed the children, while others forbid it. If possible, you should be
careful [not to touch any food].

3

For the prohibition of washing, see chapter 124, paragraphs 7, 8 and 9.
On Yom Kippur only washing for pleasure is forbidden (see also chapter
159). You should be very careful not to wash more than actually
necessary. Since you spend the entire day in the synagogue engaged in





prayer and hymns, you have probably kept your hands clean, and
should not wash them for the Ne'ilah, Minchah and Maariv services.
4

The kohanim who go up to bless the people, for Birkas Kohanim must
wash their hands up to their wrists. If they did not wash their entire
hands in the morning, but only their fingers, even though they said the
berachah Al netilas yadayim, nevertheless, since this washing is not valid
for Birkas Kohanim, they must wash their hands this time up to the
wrists, and repeat the berachah Al netilas yadayim. It is best that they
should wash their hands in the morning up to the wrists, so they will
not need to repeat the berachah.

5

A sick person, even one whose condition is not critical, may wash in the
usual manner. A bride, within thirty days of her wedding day, may
wash her face so that she should not look unattractive to her husband.

6

If someone has a nocturnal emission, God forbid, on Yom Kippur, if it
is still moist, he should wipe it off with a cloth. If it has dried, he
should wash only the soiled areas, for Halachah considers it as
excrement. It should not be washed with a garment, so that he should
not squeeze the garment by mistake. He is forbidden to immerse in a
mikvah, even though he regularly immerses himself on the other days of
the year. He should reveal his anguish to a Torah scholar and tell him
what happened to him on this holy and awe-inspiring day, and he will
instruct him what to do in order to be forgiven and live long.

7

Anointing is forbidden, even if only to remove dirt. Even to anoint only
part of the body is forbidden. But a sick person, even if his condition is
not critical, may anoint himself in the usual manner. In our regions,





where people in normal health do not usually anoint themselves on
weekdays, a person who has pimples is forbidden to anoint himself,
because it is obvious he is doing it as a cure.
8

Some authorities forbid wearing even shoes made of wood that are not
covered with leather; but shoes made of reed grass, or straw or cloth are
permitted. You should be stringent and not wear shoes even when
walking through mud and clay or in the rain. Even if you have to walk
among non-Jews it is forbidden to wear shoes. But if it is very painful
for you to walk through mud and clay, or in the rain without shoes,
you may wear shoes without heels, and if they have heels, you should
change them around, putting the left shoe on the right foot and the
right shoe on the left foot, if there is a difference between them. Before
the entrance of the synagogue you should take them off and put them
away. You should be careful not to touch them with your hands either
when putting them on or removing them, so that you will not have to
wash your hands.

9

You are permitted to stand on a pillow or a pad, even if they are made
of leather, but during the Shemoneh Esrei it is forbidden to stand on
anything. But a person who feels chilled may stand on some grass.

10

A person who is sick, even if his condition is not critical, or one who
has an injured foot, or a woman within thirty days after childbirth, is
permitted to wear shoes.

11

It is forbidden to touch your wife even during the daytime; and you
should consider her, as though she is menstrually unclean during the
entire day of Yom Kippur.




12


Pregnant and nursing women should fast the entire day, the same as
other people. A nursing woman should not fast if her child is critically
ill, and will not nurse from anyone else but her; for if she would fast,
the child's life would be threatened.

13

It is an established fact, that if you do not give a pregnant woman the
food she craves, she and the child will be in danger. Therefore if she
smelled food and it stimulated a craving for it, this precedure should be
followed: If she says ""I must eat,"" even though her facial color has not
changed, or if it did visibly change, even if she does not say anything,
you should whisper in her ear that today is Yom Kippur, because
sometimes that will calm her. But if this does not calm her, she should
be fed in the following manner: At first give her just a taste, by dipping
your finger in the soup, etc., and putting it into her mouth, because
sometimes even one drop will calm her. But if that does not help, you
should give her a little less than the halachic quantity, (see paragraph 15
below). If her mind still is not calmed, you should give her as much as
she needs. The same applies to any person who caught a smell of food
and his face turned [ashen]. Such a person is considered critically ill,
(see chapter 33:4 above) and should be treated as I wrote [above]. But
as long as his color has not changed you should not give him any food,
even if he says ""I must eat.""

14

A woman who has given birth or a person who is critically ill, with
regard to eating, drinking and the desecration of Yom Kippur, are
governed by the same Halochos that apply in the case of desecration of
Shabbos. (see chapters 92 and 93 above) However, with regard to eating
and drinking, even if several doctors say that the patient is not required





[to take food,] and even if they say that eating and drinking will be
harmful to him, but the patient says that he does require food, and
even if he says that his life is not yet in danger, but if he does not eat,
his sickness will get worse, and his life will be threatened, you should
obey his wishes and give him food; for in regard to food and drink he is
the best judge of his own condition, [as it is written, (Proverbs 14:10 )]
""The heart knows its own bitterness.""
15

When you give food to a pregnant woman or to a woman who has
given birth or to a sick person, you should place the food before them,
and say to them, ""If you feel that you may be in danger unless you eat
as much as you need, then you may eat normally, until you are satisfied.
However if it is possible for you to eat only the halachic quantity at one
time, then do as follows: Eat at one time a quantity the size of twothirds of an egg. (The quantity of food, for which a person is punished
by kareis [premature death] [if he eats it] on Yom Kippur is the size of a
large date which is a little less than a medium-size egg with the shell.)
Then take a short pause, and eat the same quantity again. The pause
between eatings should be sufficiently long so that from the end of one
meal to the beginning of the next should be at least as long as the time
needed for achilas peras. In this manner you may eat even many times,
provided the interval between two meals is at least as long as achilas
peras if you can wait that long, [and the small quantity] is sufficient for
you. (Two meals that are separated by a lesser pause, are combined, and
considered one meal.) With regard to drinking, you may drink at one
time a little less than a mouthful, pause a bit and drink again. These
pauses should be at least as long as the time needed for achilas peras, or
in any case at least [as long as it takes] to drink a reve'is. Before Yom





Kippur you should measure the lengths of these intervals by timing
them with a [stop] watch, so that you will know them exactly.""
16

If someone is overcome by a voracious, ravenous hunger, and he is
famished to the point of being sick, his symptoms being weakening
eyesight and impaired vision, you may give him food until he regains
his clear eyesight.

17

All those who are given food because their health is in danger, if no
permitted food is available, may be fed forbidden food. (see Shulchan
Aruch 618:9) If they are given forbidden food, it seems that they
should be fed less than a kazayis at a time if that is sufficient for them.

18

If your mind is at ease you should say a berachah before and after
eating, but you should not recite kiddush. In Birkas Hamazon you
should say Ya'aleh veyavo, and if it occurs on Shabbos you should say
Retzeih. But if you forgot to say it, you need not repeat Birkas
Hamazon, because it is not a mitzvah to eat bread on this day.

19

Even if boys and girls less than nine years old want to fast for a while,
they should not be permitted to do so, because it may, God forbid,
endanger their health. But when they are nine years old and in good
health, they should be trained to fast a little, and they should not eat
until a few hours past their regular mealtime. Concerning wearing
shoes, washing and anointing, children should be trained [to abstain]
even before they are nine years old.

20

It is a good practice to smell spices several times [during the day] and to
say the berachah over them, in order to fulfill the required number of
one hundred berachos a day. However, as long as your mind has not





been diverted [from inhaling the fragrance], you are forbidden to repeat
the berachah, for that would be a berachah in vain. It is necessary,
therefore, to let a long time pass between inhalations in order that you
be distracted. It is best to smell different spices each time, even if they
are of the same species, and surely this is true if you have three different
species such as fragrant woods, fragrant herbs, and spices, [each of
which has a different berachah]. If you concentrate on all the berachos
said by the Chazzan, and by those who are called to the Torah, and the
two readings of the Haftarah, you will be missing only three berachos of
the one hundred, and you will reach that number with the berachos you
say over the spices.
21

Yizkor, the memorial service for the departed is recited on Yom Kippur,
because remembering the departed saddens and humbles a man's heart,
and for the additional reason, that the dead, too, need atonement, as
expounded in Sifri: ""Forgive Your people Yisrael,"" (Deuteronomy 21:8 )
refers to the living, ""whom You have redeemed,"" refers to the dead, this
teaches us that the dead need atonement. We pledge to give charity on
their behalf, (see chapter 67:3 and when doing so you should say
""without making a vow""). A support for this practice is found at the
end of the portion of Tetzaveh (Exodus 30:10 ) where it is written, ""He
shall make atonement once each year,"" and this is followed by the verse
(verse 12) ""Each shall give an atonement offering to God."" The charity
is credited to the departed, because God, Who tests the hearts, knows
that if this man were alive, he, too, would have given charity. The living
can pray to make the judgment of the dead less severe, just as David did
when he prayed for [his son] Absalom (Maseches Sotah 10b); and the
righteous dead appeal to God on behalf of their offspring. Also on the
last day of Pesach, on the second day of Shavuos, and on Shemini





Atzeres, Yizkor is said, because on these days we read Kol habechor
[Every male first-born], (Deuteronomy 15:19 ), where it is written, ""Each
person according to the gift of his hand"" (16:17). Because of that,
people pledge money for charity. Since pledges are made to charity, it
became the accepted custom to make these pledges on behalf of the
departed souls, that God may remember them for good, and that He
may also remember us along with them for good, through their merits.
It is customary for those whose father and mother are living to leave the
synagogue during the Yizkor service. It is also the custom, during the
first year after the death of one's father or mother to leave the
synagogue [during Yizkor].
22

If there is to be a bris, it should be performed before Ashrei. The
berachah over the circumcision should be said without a cup of wine.
In our regions it is customary to say the berachah over the cup of wine,
and give a taste of it to the circumcised infant, in addition to what is
given to him when saying Bedama'yich cha'yi [In your blood, live]
(Ezekiel 16:6 ). But another child should not be given any of the wine,
(for [the laws of Yom Kippur] are more stringent than those of Tishah
beAv.) [A mohel] who is accustomed to use wine when doing the
metzitzah [sucking blood from the wound] should not spray the wine
with his mouth but with his hand, and then suck the blood with his
mouth in the usual manner.

23

It is customary to spread grass on the floor of the synagogue. The
reason for this is, that you bow down and prostrate yourself during the
Avodah, as a reminder of the service in the Beis Hamikdash, and in a
place where the ground is covered with stone it is forbidden to bow
down. Even in a place that is not tiled [with stone], it involves some





prohibition. Therefore, grass is spread to form a separation between
[you and] the ground. But if there is no grass, you should make the
separation with your tallis or use something else.
24

The time for beginning the Ne'ilah service is when the sun is over the
tree-tops, so that you will conclude it when the stars begin to appear.
Sometimes, the Ne'ilah service is drawn out into the night, but even so,
you may say Chosmeinu [seal us], because the heavenly judgment is not
concluded until Yisrael concludes the order of prayers below. If the stars
have already come out the verse Hayom yifneh [The day is drawing to a
close] etc. should not be said, because you would be speaking an
untruth. You should say, instead, Hayom panah [the day has ended],
hashemesh bo ufanah [the sun has set]. The Chazzan says Birkas
Kohanim and Sim shalom, even though it is already night.

25

We should abolish the custom of having a non-Jew light candles for the
purpose of saying the special poetic prayers in Ne'ilah, but he should
distribute the burning candles throughout the synagogue, because the
prohibition involved in this is only a derivation of a Rabbinical
injunction.

26

After the conclusion of Ne'ilah, even if it is Shabbos, and Ne'ilah ended
while it is still daytime, nevertheless, we say Avinu Malkeinu. We then
say ""Shema Yisrael"" one time, Baruch sheim kevod malchuso le'olam va'ed,
[Blessed is His name, whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever] is
said three times; Hashem hu haElokim [Hashem is God] is said seven
times, to honor the departure of the Divine Presence as it ascends to the
spiritual heights upward of above the seven heavens. The Chazzan then
sings the whole kaddish with a joyous melody. After that, one Tekiah is





sounded on the shofar, as a sign that the Shechinah has risen on high, as
was done at the Giving of the Torah. For when the Shechinah ascended,
it is said, ""When the ram's horn is blown"" etc. (Exodus 19:13 ), and it is
also said, ""God ascended amidst Teruah sounds."" It is also a reminder of
the blowing of the shofar on the Yom Kippur of the Jubilee Year. It is
permitted to blow the shofar even though the stars have not yet
appeared and it is still twilight, even on Shabbos. But when it is yet
daytime, the shofar should not be blown. After the Tekiah everyone says
three times, Leshanah haba'ah birushalayim [Next year [may we be] in
Jerusalem].
27

After the stars have come out the Maariv service is said. A respected
person should be chosen as Chazzan, and the prayers should be said
slowly and intently. Those who pray in a hurry should be scolded. In
the Shemoneh Esrei you should say Ata chonantanu [You have favored
us]. If Yom Kippur occurred on Shabbos you should say Veyiten lecha
[May God give you], but you do not say Vihi no'am [May the
pleasantness] and Ve'ata kadosh [You are the Holy One]. After the
prayers, Kiddush levanah [Sanctification of the moon] is said, and
people exchange good wishes with one another, with happiness and a
glad heart, as on a Yom Tov.

28

In the Havdalah of Yom Kippur night, you must say the berachah only
over a candle that was lit before Yom Kippur, and not over a light that is
produced now by means of a match or something similar, nor over a
light that has been lit from such a light. The best way is to light a
candle from the flame of the candle you lit in your house the day
before, and to say the berachah over both of them. If you have no
burning candle in your house you should bring a burning candle from





the synagogue, light another candle from it and say a berachah over
both of them. In extreme circumstances, you may say the berachah over
a candle that was lit from a candle of a non-Jew, or from a flame that
was produced by means of a match, or something similar. You should
not begin the Havdalah with Hinei keil yeshuasi [Behold the Almighty is
my deliverance], [rather you should begin] and say the berachah over a
cup of wine, over the candle, and then say Hamavdil. You should not
say a berachah over spices. If it is Shabbos night you should say the
berachah over spices, and then you also begin with Hinei keil yeshuasi,
as on any other Shabbos night.
29

We eat and drink and we rejoice at the conclusion of Yom Kippur, as it
is said in the Midrash, ""At the conclusion of Yom Kippur a heavenly
voice goes forth and says: 'Go, eat your bread with gladness, and drink
your wine with a cheerful heart, for God has already accepted your
deeds with favor.'""

30

People who are meticulous in observing the mitzvos begin to build the
sukkah, immediately after the end of Yom Kippur, fulfilling the verse,
""They go from strength to strength"" (Psalms 84:8 ).




31


On the day after Yom Kippur it is customary to rise early to go to the
synagogue. On the days between Yom Kippur and Sukkos, we do not
fast even the fast of a Yahrtzeit. We do not say Tachanun [on these
days], because they are days of rejoicing during which the Altar was
dedicated in the days of King Solomon, and also because we are
occupied with the mitzvah of building the sukkah, and preparing the
esrog, and the other species in honor of the Master of masters, the
sanctifier of Yisrael and the seasons.
"
"1

It is a mitzvah to build the sukkah immediately, on the day after Yom
Kippur, even if it is erev Shabbos, because when a mitzvoh presents itself
you should not put it off. You should select a clean location to build it.
It is a mitzvah for everyone to be personally involved in building the
sukkah and laying the sechach (covering). Even though he is a
distinguished person, it is considered an honor to be personally
involved in the mitzvah. It would have been appropriate to say the
berachah Shehecheyanu when building the sukkah, but we rely on the
Shehecheyanu that is said in the Kiddush. You should endeaver to
decorate the sukkah and to adorn it with beautiful things and elegant
spreads, according to your means.

2

Concerning the walls of the sukkah, there are many different halachos,
and not everyone is familiar with them. Therefore, you must make the
walls full-length (complete) and strong, so that the wind cannot shake
them or blow out the candles. If you do not have enough [lumber] for
[four] walls, it is better to make three complete walls than four





incomplete ones. If you can afford it, it is a mitzvah to build a sukkah
with a roof, that can open and close on hinges, so that you can close it
when it rains; and when the rain is over, you can open it again. This
way, the sechach is kept dry, and you can fulfill the mitzvah of sukkah
properly.
3

With regard to sechach, there are also many halachos. It is our custom to
cover the sukkah with branches of trees or with reeds. Since they grow
in the earth, and are detached from the soil, and do not absorb ritual
impurity, and are not tied together, you have no reason at all to hesitate
[using them].

4

Initially, you should be stringent, and avoid placing anything that
absorbs ritual impurity to serve as a supporting beam for the sechach,
such as ladders which have [in their side pieces] holes in which the
rungs are inserted, and certainly other utensils, such as a spade or a
rake. Even placing them on top of the sechach to reinforce it, should be
avoided. However, if they are in place already, or you have nothing else
[to serve the purpose], all these are permitted for we have an established
rule that it is permitted to support the sechach with something that
absorbs ritual impurity.

5

You must put enough sechach on the sukkah to provide more shade than
sun, for if there is more sun than shade, the sukkah is invalid, according
to Torah law. Care must be taken, therefore, to put on enough sechach;
that, even if it dries out, there will still be more shade than sun. You
must also be careful not to leave an open space of three tefachim in any
one place. Initially, it is necessary to leave a slight space between the
branches of the sukkah, so that the stars can be seen. Nevertheless, if the





sechach is so thick that the stars cannot be seen, the sukkah is still valid.
But if the sechach is so thick, that even a heavy rain cannot come
through, then it is almost like a house, and the sukkah is invalid.
6

When sukkos are solidly constructed, sometimes boards jut out along
the top of the walls, and on these boards, the beams are placed on
which the sechach rests. If this board is less than four amos wide, the
sukkah does not become invalid, because of invalid sechah, for there is a
halachic tradition from Mount Sinai, that when a board projects less
than four amos, we say that it is a curved wall, which means that the
protruding board is considered part of the wall, and we regard the wall
as if it is bent at the top. But you may not sit or sleep underneath that
board, for Halachah does not recognize that area as part of the sukkah,
even if the board is only four tefachim wide; but the rest of the sukkah is
valid. But if protruding from the sukkah wall, there are boards that are
four amos or more wide, then they are called invalid sechach which
invalidates the entire sukkah. Nevertheless, if the boards protrude into
the sukkah only on one side, as is the style in some of the built
[permanent] sukkos, where a small shelf is installed on one side (to put
the dishes there when it starts to rain), then it does not matter; since it
is only on one side, there are still three valid walls on which there is
valid sechach; and a sukkah made of three walls is also valid, provided it
has the minimum size required for a sukkah, which is no less than seven
tefachim by seven tefachim square. But you must not sit underneath the

If you build a sukkah underneath the branches of a tree it is invalid.
Even if the branches alone would have allowed more sun than shade,
and consequently, by placing the sechach on the sukkah, you, in fact,





made it into a sukkah [by providing the required shade], it is,
nevertheless, invalid. Even if you cut off the branches of the tree
afterwards, the sukkah still remains invalid, for it is written, ""Make
[ta'aseh] the festival of Sukkos for yourself"" (Deuteronomy 16:13 ), and it
is expounded, ""A sukkah must be made, and not come into being by
itself."" (see chapter 9:6 above) Therefore, after cutting the branches of
the tree, you must pick up each branch of the sechach and a new act of
placing it down must be performed, for the purpose of fulfilling the
mitzvah of sukkah. It is also forbidden to lay down the sechach before
making the walls for it is required that with the laying of the sechach the
sukkah should become valid for use.
8

Similarly when you build a sukkah with a roof that can be opened [and
closed], you must open the roof before you put down the sechach, and if
afterwards you close the roof and open it again, it does not matter, for
it is the same as if you spread a sheet over it and then remove it.
Nevertheless, you should be stringent, and have the roof open at the
onset of the Yom Tov. You must also take care with these sukkos that the
roof is wide open, straight in line with the wall of the sukkah. For if it is
not perfectly straight, but inclines slightly over the sechach, even if the
area covered is not large enough to make the sukkah invalid,
nevertheless, you should be careful not to sit under the area over which
the roof protrudes, for you would then be sitting underneath the roof.
(see paragraph 6 above) Although a sukkah is exempt from a mezuzah
during the Yom Tov, nevertheless, the permanently built sukkos, that are
used all year and are required to have a mezuzah, are not exempt during
Sukkos, and it is not necessary after Sukkos to affix the mezuzah again.

You may fulfill your obligation with a borrowed sukkah, but not with a
sukkah that was stolen. It is forbidden, therefore, to build a sukkah in a
public domain. In extreme situations when there is no other sukkah
available under any circumstance you may sit in it and say the berachah
in it.

10

You should be careful not to cut the sechach for your sukkah yourself,
but you should buy it from someone else. In exterme situations, you
may cut it yourself, but you should get permission from the owner of
the land.

11

You are permitted to build a sukkah during Chol Hamo'ed.

12

The wood of the sukkah, either of the walls or of the sechach, is
forbidden to be used [for any purpose] until after Simchas Torah,
because they were set aside for the performance of a mitzvah. Even to
take a splinter from it to use as a toothpick is forbidden. Even if [a
piece of wood] fell down you are forbidden to use it; and it is of no
avail [if you had made] a stipulation [before Yom Tov] [to use such
wood.] If Simchas Torah occurs on Friday, the wood is forbidden also on
Shabbos. The sukkah decorations are also forbidden to be used, even if
they fell down. Since it is forbidden to derive any benefit from them,
consequently, on Shabbos and Yom Tov it is forbidden to handle them
because they are muktzeh. Nevertheless, if an esrog is hanging in the
sukkah as a decoration, you are permitted to inhale its fragrance, for it
was not set aside in regard to its fragrance. With regard to decorations
hanging from the sechach, it is generally accepted that even if you made
a stipulation [to use them on Yom Tov], it is of no avail. However,





regarding decorations hanging on the walls, this stipulation is effective.
Tapestries that are hung in the sukkah as decorations, it is the accepted
practice to remove them so that they should not get ruined by an
impending rain, even if you had made no express stipulation; for we
assume that initially you had that in mind when you hung them.
Nevertheless, it is best to express prior stipulation, that is, before
twilight on the eve of Sukkos, you should stand [in the sukkah] and say,
""I hereby stipulate that I am permitted to eat, and to use the
decorations of this sukkah whenever I wish."" You must be careful about
those sukkah decorations that you intend to remove during Yom Tov,
not to tie them with a knot, but only with a loop, (see chapter 80:45,
46 above).
13

Even after Sukkos, when you dismantle the sukkah, you should not step
on the boards, and you should not use them in a degrading manner,
because they are articles that were used for a mitzvah, the same as
tzitzis. (see chapter 9:19)

14

It is forbidden to carve out the verse ""You must live in sukkos"" etc. or
any other verse on a pumpkin or similar fruit as a sukkah decoration,
because it will subsequently be degraded, and besides, it is forbidden to
write a verse needlessly.

15

On erev Sukkos, after midday you should not eat bread, so that you will
eat your meal in the sukkah with good appetite. You should give
generous amounts of charity on erev sukkos.

It is written ""For seven days teishvu in sukkos,"" (Leviticus 23:42 ), which
means ""you must dwell"" in sukkos. The Torah teaches that you should
make the sukkah your home for seven days. Just as you live in your
home all year, so now [on Sukkos] the sukkah should be your principal
residence. There you should bring your fine china and elegant
tablecloths. You should eat, drink, study, spend your leisure, and sleep
in the sukkah. Even conversation with friends should be held in the
sukkah, and if you pray alone you should also pray in the sukkah. It is
written, ""This is so that future generations will know that I caused the
Israelites to live in sukkos when I brought them out of Egypt,""
(Leviticus 23:43 ). Therefore, you should keep in mind when you live in
the sukkah, that the Holy One, blessed is He, commanded us to live in
the sukkah as a memorial of the Exodus from Egypt. Regarding the
sukkos of which the verse says ""That I caused [the Israelites] to live in
sukkos, there is disagreement among Taanaim. Rabbi Eliezer says that it
refers to the Clouds of Glory with which the Holy One, blessed is He,
surrounded our forefathers, to shield them from the heat and the sun.
Rabbi Akiva, says that it means actual sukkos that they built for
themselves when they camped [in the desert] as a protection from the
sun. Although we departed from Egypt in the month of Nisan, He did
not command us to build the sukkah during that season, because it is
the beginning of the summer, when people usually build booths for the
shade, and it would not be recognized as being built in order to fulfill
the mitzvah of the Creator, blessed is His Name. He, therefore,
commanded us to make it in the seventh month, which is the rainy
season, when people usually move out of their booths to live in their
homes; but we move out of our houses to live in the sukkah; which
makes it clear to all that we are fulfilling the King's command.




2


You should maintain the sukkah with dignity so that mitzvos should not
be treated with disrespect. Therefore, you should not bring into it
vessels that are unbecoming to a sukkah, such as pots, pitchers used for
drawing water, vessels in which you keep flour, kneading troughs,
kettles, frying pans, mortars, or similar utensils. After the meal, the
dishes should be cleared away from the sukkah, but drinking glasses
may remain in the sukkah. People usually do not bring earthen
candlesticks into the sukkah because they are repulsive. You should not
do undignified work in the sukkah like washing pots and dishes. But
you are allowed to rinse a wine cup. Of course, it is forbidden to
urinate there, even in a vessel, even if one usually does so in his house.
But marital relations are permitted in the sukkah, for the underlying
principle of the mitzvah is for husband and wife to be together. If you
bring offensive vessels into the sukkah it does not become invalid, but
while they are there you should not say the berachah Leisheiv basukkah,
until they have been removed.

3

Eating in the sukkah on the first night of Sukkos, is an obligation. It is
required that you eat in the sukkah not less than a kazayis of bread; and
even if you suffer discomfort you are obligated to eat it in the sukkah. If
it rains, (see paragraph 9 below) and it seems that it will stop in an hour
or two, you should wait and then say the Kiddush and eat in the sukkah,
in the appropriate way. But if it appears that the rain is not stopping, or
you waited and it did not stop, then you should say the Kiddush in the
sukkah and say Shehecheyanu, and have in mind when saying
Shehecheyanu that this berachah also applies to the sukkah, but you
should not say Leisheiv basukkah. You then wash your hands and say
Hamotzi and eat a kazayis of bread in the sukkah without interruption;





and then go into your house to complete the meal. You should bear in
mind when washing your hands and when saying Hamotzi that you also
intend to eat in the house. (See chapter 42:19, 21 below) If it stops
raining before you said Birkas Hamazon, you should go back to the
sukkah, say the berachah Leisheiv basukkah, eat slightly more than a
kebeitzah of bread, and say Birkas Hamazon. If it stops raining after you
said Birkas Hamazon, you should also return to the sukkah, wash your
hands again, eat more than a kebeitzah of bread, saying the berachah
Leisheiv basukkah, and then say Birkas Hamazon. If after the rain has
stopped, water is still dripping from the sechach in your own sukkah,
and there is a sukkah in your neighborhood that was closed with a roof,
and after the rain they opened it, you should go there and eat your meal
in good spirits.
4

On the second night of Sukkos it is also mandatory to eat in the sukkah,
even if you suffer discomfort. It is governed by the same halachos that
apply to the first night, as we have written, except for one difference,
that if it appears that the rain is not going to stop, or if you waited and
it did not stop, you should recite the Kiddush in the house and eat your
meal there, and before saying Birkas Hamazon, you should go to the
sukkah and eat at least a kazayis of bread without saying Leisheiv
basukkah. You then return to the house and say Birkas Hamazon.

5

In the evening, on returning from the synagogue you should enter the
sukkah and immediately say the Kiddush, but you should not say
Kiddush unless you are sure that it is night. When you say Leisheiv
basukkah you should be mindful to exempt with this berachah, the
meal you are eating now, your sleeping [in the sukkah], and other
necessities you will do in the sukkah, until you say Kiddush again the





next morning. When saying Shehecheyanu you should be mindful that
this berachah applies to the Yom Tov as well as to the sukkah. Therefore,
on the first night you should say first Leisheiv basukkah, and then
Shehecheyanu, so that the Shehecheyanu applies to the sukkah as well;
but on the second night you should first say Shehecheyanu and then
Leisheiv basukkah.
6

When several heads of families eat in one sukkah and there are also
women, and other members of the family who must listen attentively to
the Kiddush in order to fulfill their obligation; and, if all the men recite
the Kiddush at the same time since two voices cannot be heard
simultaneously, [their voices would become unintelligible,] and the
family members would not hear the Kiddush clearly. It is best, therefore,
that they should say the Kiddush one at a time. If they do recite the
Kiddush simultaneously, [for example] in a situation when there is no
one who has to fulfill his obligation by listening to the Kiddush; then if
one of them finished saying the berachah Borei peri hagafen, or one of
the other berachos, before the others, then the one who finishes early
should not respond Amein to the berachah of the other, because saying
Amein constitutes an interruption between the Borei peri hagafen [he
just now said] and the drinking of the wine. Some people are
accustomed to wait for the others to finish the Kiddush and to respond
Amein. This is not according to Halachah; but they should all say it
together.

7

On the other nights and days of Sukkos, you are not obligated to eat in
the sukkah; but if you want to eat a regular meal or to sleep, you must
do so in the sukkah. What is meant by a ""regular meal?"" If you eat more
than a kebeitzah of bread, even if you do not schedule it as a ""meal,""





and even if it is pastry, [similar to a blintz or a strudel it must be eaten
in the sukkah]. Similarly, any dish made of [one of ] the five species of
grain, if it is more than a kebeitzah and you scheduled it as a ""meal,""
you must eat it in the sukkah and say the berachah Leisheiv basukkah.
But even if you eat a large quantity of fruit and you scheduled it as a
meal, you are allowed to eat the fruit outside the sukkah. Also wine or
other beverages, or meat and cheese may be eaten and drunk outside
the sukkah, provided you do not schedule it as a meal. But if you want
to drink wine or other beverages as a scheduled ""meal,"" or you want to
eat meat or cheese as a scheduled ""meal,"" you must have it in the
sukkah, but without saying the berachah Leisheiv basukkah. It is best to
eat some bread first, so that you can say the berachah. All this is as
required by Halachah, but those who are more meticulous and do not
even drink water outside the sukkah are considered praiseworthy.
8

Sleeping, or even taking a nap, according to Halachah, must be in the
sukkah. And this is the practice of those who are scrupulous in
observing the mitzvos; they, indeed, do not even take a nap outside the
sukkah. But nowadays, many people are lenient with regard to sleeping
[in the sukkah]. The later authorities, of blessed memory, wrote a
number of reasons to justify this leniency to an extent. However, every
God-fearing person, should be stringent and build a sukkah in which he
and his wife can dwell in the same manner they live the entire year, if
possible. At minimum, [the sukkah] should be suitable for him to sleep
in, for if it does not meet these standards it is not valid, even post
factum [even after it was already built].

9

If it rains, you are exempt from [staying in] the sukkah. How heavy a
rain must it be for you to be exempt? If it rains so much, that in your





judgment, if that much rain would drip into your cooked food, it
would be spoiled, even if the food is not actually in the sukkah, or if
you estimate, that if it would rain that much into the room where you
are sitting, you would move into another room, then you may leave the
sukkah and go into the house. If you started to eat in the sukkah, and
then it began to rain, so that you went into the house and started to eat
there; or because of the rain you began initially to eat in the house, and
then it stopped raining, you may finish your meal in the house, and
you are not obligated to leave while the meal is in progress, to go from
your house into the sukkah. When it is so cold that the food in the
sukkah jells, you are exempt from sitting in the sukkah, and you may eat
in the house.
10

As for sleeping in the sukkah, even a slight rain causes discomfort when
you sleep, and you may leave [the sukkah when it rains]. If you left the
sukkah to sleep in the house, and then it stopped raining; or if you
initially went to sleep in the house because of the rain and then the rain
stopped, you do not have to bother to go to the sukkah during the
night, but you may sleep in the house until morning.

11

Anyone who is exempt from staying in the sukkah and does not leave is
called a simpleton, and will receive no reward for it. And he is not
permitted to say the berachah [Leisheiv basukkah], because it would be
a berachah said in vain. When you leave the sukkah because of rain, you
should not complain [in anger] as you leave, but go out feeling
humbled, like a servant who poured a cup [of wine] for his master, and
the master poured a pitcher [of water] into his face.




12


It is the custom to say the berachah Leisheiv basukkah only when you
eat a regular meal. And it is the custom to say the Hamotzi first, and
then Leisheiv basukkah, before you begin to eat. Everything that you eat
in the sukkah the entire day, and whatever you do while staying there,
even if you sleep there, is exempt with the berachah you said before
eating the regular meal, [and it exempts everything] until you eat your
next regular meal. If you did not leave the sukkah to go to business or
to the synagogue between meals, since you once said the berachah, you
need not repeat it at the next meal. Even if during the entire week of
Sukkos, you would dwell in the sukkah eating, studying, praying and
sleeping there, you would need to say the berachah only one time,
because your thoughts were never diverted from the sukkah. Even if you
left the sukkah temporarily, with the intention of returning
immediately, it is not considered a diversion, and you need not say the
berachah at the following meal. However, if you went out to do
business, or to go to the synagogue, or for similar reasons; even if you
went into your house to study, or to do something which is time
consuming, it also constitutes a distraction, and you must say the
berachah at the next meal.

13

If you leave the sukkah even in the middle of your meal, to go to a
friend's sukkah, and you eat a quantity of food which must be eaten in
the sukkah, you must say Leisheiv basukkah there too.

14

If you forgot to say Leisheiv basukkah, and you become aware of it in
the middle of the meal, or even after you finished the meal, you must
still say the berachah, because by staying in the sukkah after the meal
you are also fulfilling the mitzvah.




15


Women are exempt from the mitzvah of sukkah, nevertheless, they are
permitted to say the berachah. Children also, are exempt, Nevertheless,
if a boy is five years and over, his father must train him to eat in the
sukkah. Even if the father is not at home, he should not be permitted to
eat outside the sukkah.

16

A sick person and his attendants are exempt from the mitzvah of
sukkah. However, if the patient is not critically ill, the attendants are
exempt only when he needs them. If he is critically ill, they are exempt
even when he does not need them so urgently.

17

[If staying in the sukkah] causes you discomfort, that is if you are
troubled by the cold weather or the wind, or by a bad odor or similar
annoyances, you are exempt from the mitzvah of sukkah on all nights
other [than the first night], and on all the days of Sukkos. Similarly, if
the light in the sukkah went out on Shabbos, and it is a great bother for
you to go to a friend's sukkah, then you may go to your house, if the
candles are burning there. This only applies if initially you made your
sukkah properly, and it was only an accident that caused you to be
uncomfortable while sitting or sleeping there. But if initially you made
the sukkah in a place where there is an offensive odor, or similar
[irritation], or in a place where you are afraid to sleep, then you cannot
fulfill your obligation even when you eat there in the daytime. If the
wind threatens to blow out the candles [on Shabbos], as it passes
through the walls, you are permitted to spread a sheet or a garment on
the wall.




18


People traveling in the daytime are exempt from eating in the sukkah
during the day, because they have no time to look for a sukkah, since
they must move along. But if they are able to sit in a sukkah without
too much trouble, they are obligated to do so. At night, when they are
at the lodging where they intend to stay overnight, they must make an
effort to [find] a sukkah in which to dwell. Even if they are in a place
where there is no sukkah, if they can make one at a small cost, they
must endeavor to have a sukkah for sleeping. If they are also traveling at
night they are governed by the same Halachos that apply in the daytime.
People who travel to villages on Chol Hamoed to collect debts, and
cannot make a sukkah there, must assume the inconvenience of
returning home every night in order to fulfill the mitzvah of sukkah.

19

People traveling for the sake of doing a mitzvah, and would find it
bothersome to find a sukkah, or if it is not convenient for them to sleep
in the sukkah, and if they would sleep there they would be tired the
next morning, and would be hampered in the performance of the
mitzvah, are exempt from the mitzvah of sukkah; otherwise, they are
obligated to fulfill it.

20

If watchmen who guard gardens, orchards, grain and other produce,
find it possible to watch everything from one location, they should
make a sukkah there, in which to stay.

21

Men who make wine in non-Jewish areas are exempt of the mitzvah of
sukkah, whether by day or by night, because they must watch
continuously that a non-Jew should not touch the wine. But if the





situation is such that no watching is needed, then they are required to
stay in the sukkah.
22

People who stay in a store, even if they live out of town, and the store is
in town, and during the year they eat most of their daily meals there,
nevertheless, on Sukkos they are required to eat in the sukkah.
"
"1

It is a time-honored custom in Yisrael that when you buy an esrog and a
lulav, and you are not an expert in these Halachos, you should show it
to an halachic authority to determine if they are valid, because there are
many different Halachos regarding them. You should do your best to
buy a fresh lulav, because a dry lulav may be used only in extreme
circumstances. Some authorities say, that [a lulav] that is no longer
green is considered dry. The required length of a lulav is that it's main
stem besides the upper leaves should measure four tefachim. In extreme
circumstances, a length of 13⅓ egudlin is sufficient.

2

The hadas (myrtle twig) must have leaves growing in groups of three,
that is, each set of leaf buds should produce three leaves on the same
horizontal level, none should be higher or lower than the others. Also it
is essential that the leaves cover the twig, that is, that the tip of each leaf
should overlap the stem of the leaf above it. Among the hadassim that
are imported from distant places you rarely find valid ones, and you
must, therefore, examine them. A God-fearing person should do his
best to buy hadassim that are fresh, green and have leaves ""in a
threesome,"" and are beautiful. You must make sure that those grown
locally have not been grafted, and have not been grown in a pot that





has no hole [in the bottom]. Similarly, we must be concerned regarding
the lulavim that grow in our region. If hadassim with ""threesome"" leaves
are unavailable you may take those without ""threesome"" leaves, but you
should not say the berachah.
3

The required length of a hadas is three tefachim. In extreme
circumstances ten egudlin is sufficient. The entire hadas, from bottom
to top, should have leaves growing in ""threesomes."" In extreme
circumstances, however, if at the bottom there are a few leaves not in
""threesomes,"" but on top the majority are ""threesomes,"" it is also valid.
You should be careful that the leaves of the hadas should not fall off; for
even if some of the leaves fall off, there are many differing Halachos,
and you must consult an halachic authority.

4

You should make sure that the top [of the hadas] is not broken off, that
is, the top of the wooden stem. If you have only hadassim with brokenoff tops, you should consult an halachic authority. But the small sidebranches that grow between the leaf-buds must be broken off so that
they should not form a separation between the leaf-buds.

5

The aravah (willow) is well-known, it has lengthy leaves that have
smooth edges, and it has a red stem. Even when the stem is still green,
the aravah is valid, because if it stays on the tree it turns red. Most of
this species grow near a brook, therefore, they are called arvei nachal
[willows of the brook] (Leviticus 23:40 ). But even if they grow
elsewhere they are valid, but if it is possible, you should try to get those
that grow near a brook. The required size of the aravah is the same as
that of the hadas.




6


An aravah that is dried up, or if most of its leaves have fallen off, or if
its stem is broken off, is invalid. Some authorities say, that if the leaves
are partially torn from the stem and are hanging limp it is also invalid.
You should be extremely careful also with regard to the aravah, because
sometimes when you insert it in its place among the lulav [and the
hadas], or because of the waving, the leaves fall off and then it becomes
invalid.

7

Care should be taken that a Jew should not personally cut off any of the
four species from a tree for his own use, even if the owner of the land
gives him permission; but a non-Jew or another Jew should cut them
off and then he should buy it from him.

8

You should take three hadas branches and two aravah branches, (no
more than that), and bind them together with the lulav, so that they
become one bundle. You should make sure that they are all [bound
together] in the direction they grow, that is, with the cut edges
downward. For, if only one branch is upside down, it is invalid, even ex
post facto, [after it is already done]. You should bind the hadas on the
right of the stem of the lulav and the aravah on its left side, that is,
when you take the lulav, with its stem facing you, the hadas should be
opposite your right and the aravah opposite your left. On the bottom
they should all be even, so that when you take the lulav you should
hold all the species [in your hand]. Nevertheless, you should see to it
that the hadas should be slightly higher than the aravah. And you
should make sure that the stem of the lulav protrudes at least a tefach
above the hadas. You should tie all of them together with a complete
knot, that is, two knots one on top of the other. Besides binding these





[three] species together you should also fasten three more bands on the
lulav. However, at least only one tefach at the top of the lulav should
remain without a band, in order to make a rustling sound when you
shake it. If there is a string tied around the hadassim, you must remove
it before binding it with the lulav, so that nothing intervenes between
[the hadassim and the lulav]. If the lulav-bundle becomes undone on
Yom Tov, it is forbidden to tie it on Yom Tov with a knot, but you may
make a loop, or as the custom is, to wind the strip around the lulav and
insert the end of the strip into the ring you made.
9

An aravah that was cut off the tree either on the first day of Yom Tov or
on the second day is forbidden to be handled on that day, because it is
absolutely muktzeh. If it was cut on the first day, it may be used on the
second day. But if the first day occurs on Shabbos, and it was cut then,
it is also forbidden on the second day. If an esrog was brought in, from
outside the Shabbos boundary, or if any of the other species were
brought in, you may handle them and fulfill the mitzvah with them.
But if the city has no eiruv, you may not move them outside the house
where they are found; and all must go to this house to fulfill the
mitzvah with them.

10

Should you not have been able to obtain choice specimens of all four
species, you should rather fulfill the mitzvah with a set belonging to a
friend, [who has obtained choice specimen,] (see following chapter, par.
8). Nevertheless, it is a mitzvah for you to obtain for yourself the best
four species you can afford, in order to wave with them when you say
Halleil and also for the Hakafos.
"
"


1


You should take the lulav, together with the bundle, the stem [spine] of
the lulav facing you—in your right hand, and the esrog in your left
hand. As in all mitzvos, you must say the berachah on the lulav before
performing the mitzvah. You must also hold the esrog in the manner it
grows, that is, that the stem from where it was cut off the tree should
point downward and the pitam [knob on top] upward. Therefore, when
you pick up the esrog before saying the berachah, you should hold it
upside down, with the stem facing upward and the pitam downward, in
order not to fulfill the mitzvah before saying the berachah. Then, while
standing, you should say the berachah Al netilas lulav [Concerning the
taking of the lulav]. (Because the lulav is taller than any of the other
species, it is considered more important, and the entire bundle is called
by that name.) On the first day of Sukkos you should also say
Shehecheyanu. If the first day of Sukkos occurs on Shabbos, when we do
not take the lulav, then you say Shehecheyanu on the second day. After
the berachah you turn the esrog around, and holding it close to the
lulav, so that there is no separation between them, you wave [the
species] towards the four points of the earth, in this sequence: East,
South, West, North, up and down. When waving during Halleil and
during the Hoshanos, you should also be careful to hold the esrog close
to the lulav, so that there is no separation between them. If you did it
in the opposite manner, and took the esrog with the right hand and the
lulav with the left hand you should take them again, without saying the
berachah.

2

A left-handed person should take the lulav with his ""right"" hand, which
is everyone else's left hand, and the esrog with his [so-called] ""left""
hand. If he did it in the opposite manner he should take them again





without saying a berachah. A person who is ambidextrous is considered
as any [right-handed] person.
3

It is proper to take off the tefillin before taking the lulav in hand, or at
least remove the strap from your hand, so that nothing intervenes
between [your hand and the esrog.] It is also proper to remove the rings
from your fingers.

4

The order of the waving in Halleil is as follows: There are six words in
Hodu [Give thanks] besides the Name Hashem; and at each word you
should wave in a different direction; but when saying Hashem, you
should not wave. At Hodu you wave towards the East (straight ahead),
at ki towards the South (right), at tov towards the West (back), at ki
towards the North (left), at le'olam,—upward; at chasdo, —downward.
The Chazzan waves only at Hodu and at Yomar na Yisrael. The
congregation waves each time they say Hodu. At Ana, both the Chazzan
and the congregation wave only when saying Ana Hashem hoshiah na,
[Please Hashem, save now!] But since this verse has only three words
besides Hashem, you should wave at each word in two directions. In the
Hodu at the conclusion of Halleil both the Chazzan and the
congregation wave again. When waving downward you should lower
only your hands, while the lulav and the other species should remain
[in an upright position] the same way they grow. People who have the
custom to turn the lulav downwards should not change their custom. It
is not necessary to turn your face in the direction in which you are
waving; you should only point the top of the lulav, [in that direction].
You do not have to wave the lulav forcefully, just shaking it slightly to
rustle the leaves is sufficient.




5


It is forbidden to eat before fulfilling the mitzvah of lulav. If you are
traveling and anticipate to arrive at a place where there is an esrog and a
lulav; or people who live in small villages, [and must wait until] an esrog
and lulav is sent to them, must wait until midday, but no later, because
it is forbidden to fast longer than that on Yom Tov and Chol Hamoed. If
you feel faint and cannot wait until noon, you may have something to
eat before; but if you do not feel faint you should be stringent and
abstain from tasting any food.

6

You are permitted to replace the lulav in water on Yom Tov, and add
water to the vessel [in which it is placed], but you may not change the
water. However, on Chol Hamoed it is a mitzvah to change the water for
the purpose of keeping the lulav fresh and beautiful. It is customary to
buy fresh aravos on each day of Chol Hamoed, for the lulav; for thereby
you enhance the beauty of the mitzvah.

7

It is forbidden to inhale the fragrance of the hadassim during the seven
days of Sukkos, even on Shabbos. But you may inhale the aroma of the
esrog on Shabbos, and you should say the berachah Hanosein rei'ach tov
bapeiros, [Who places a good aroma into fruit]. But on the other days
of Sukkos, you should not smell it, even when you are not taking it to
fulfill the mitzvah, because it is halachically doubtful whether you
should say a berachah on it. It is forbidden to handle the lulav on
Shabbos, even if you need the lulav itself or the space it occupies,
because it is muktzeh. However, since you are permitted to smell the
esrog, it is not muktzeh, and you may handle it. And you are permitted
to put it back in the cotton where it was kept before Yom Tov, because
it already absorbed the fragrance. However you should not place it in





new cotton or in a garment, because you are creating fragrance in the
garment, [which is forbidden on Shabbos].
8

On the first day of Sukkos, you cannot fulfill the mitzvah with a lulav
and other species that were borrowed, but they must actually belong to
you, for it is written, ""And take for yourself on the first day."" (Leviticus
23:40 ) And [our Rabbis] expound ""For yourself"" means ""from that

which is yours,"" which excludes a borrowed [lulav or other species]
Those living outside Eretz Yisrael who observe Yom Tov two days,
because of a doubt [about the date], even on the second day should not
say a berachah [over a borrowed lulav]. If someone gives you his lulav as
a gift, on condition that you return it, it is considered [halachically as] a
gift and you may fulfill the mitzvah with it. Even if he gives it to you
unconditionally for the purpose of fulfilling the mitzvah, it is
considered as if he had expressly stipulated that he is giving it to you as
a gift on condition that you return it. If the husband is not at home
and the wife wants to give the lulav to someone to fulfill the mitzvah,
the validity depends on the judgment of the husband's disposition,
whether or not he would mind.
9

If people joined to buy an esrog and the other species [in partnership],
we presume that they bought it with the understanding, that when it is
time to perform the mitzvah, each partner would transfer his share to
the other. Therefore, it is customary for the congregation to buy an
esrog, and the entire congregation fulfills the mitzvah with it, and
whoever can afford it must contribute to the ""esrog fund."" Still, it is
better to fulfill the mitzvah with an esrog belonging to an individual, if
all his species are superbly beautiful, because an individual's transfer of
ownership is more effective.




10


On the first day of Sukkos minor children should not be permitted to
take the lulav and esrog before the adults have fulfilled the mitzvah, for
a minor can acquire an object but cannot transfer ownership, according
to Torah law.

11

On all the days of Sukkos, after the Musaf service, it is customary to
carry a Seifer Torah to the bimah. The Ark remains open until the
conclusion of the Hoshana service, when the Seifer Torah is returned to
the Ark. All men who possess an esrog and lulav circle the bimah, where
the Seifer Torah is held, while the Hoshanos are recited. Each day they
circle the bimah once. But on the seventh day [of Sukkos] which is
Hoshana Rabbah, all the Sifrei Torah are removed from the Ark and
brought to the bimah. The bimah is circled seven times, in
remembrance of the Beis Hamikdash, where each day [of Sukkos] they
would circle the altar once and on the seventh day, seven times. The
hakafos (circuits) should be made, [starting] to the right. Since the Seifer
Torah is on the bimah, and the entire congregation must turn towards
the Seifer Torah on the bimah before beginning the hakafah, their right
side thus faces North; therefore, the circle moves in a northerly
direction. A person who owns an esrog and lulav and does not encircle
the bimah manifests poor conduct. In some communities it is
customary on Hoshana Rabbah and Simchas Torah, after they remove all
the Sifrei Torah from the Ark, to place a burning candle in it (to
indicate that Torah is light, and when the Torah is not there, another
light is needed). This is not a proper custom and should be abolished,
for it is forbidden to use the Holy Ark for secular purposes, even
temporarily.




12


On Shabbos no circuits are made because even in the Beis Hamikdash
they did not circle the altar [on Shabbos]. Therefore, a Seifer Torah is
not brought to the bimah, but the Holy Ark is left open until after the
Hoshanos are said.

13

A person who becomes a mourner on Sukkos, or a mourner during the
twelve months after the death of his father or mother, according to
custom, should not encircle the bimah, but he should give his esrog and
lulav to someone who does not own a lulav, to circle the bimah.
"
"1

The fifth (in Eretz Yisrael, the sixth) day of Chol Hamoed is Hoshana
Rabbah. It is customary to stay awake the preceding night and to study
Torah, according to the order printed [in the Tikkun], because on
Sukkos we are judged with regard to water, upon which human life
depends, and this day is the last day of Sukkos, and all depends upon
the conclusion [of judgment.] At Shacharis additional candles are lit in
the synagogue, as on Yom Kippur, and the Chazzan wears a kittel.
Lamenatzei'ach [for the choirmaster] is said as on Yom Tov, and Mizmor
lesodah [a psalm of thanksgiving] is also said, but Nishmas [the soul] is
not said. We say Ein kamocha [There is none like you], and Shema
Yisrael, as on Yom Tov. In the Kedusha of Musaf we say Na'aritzecha
[We will revere].

2

The prophets instituted the custom, that each person should take a
special aravah, on that day besides the aravah in the lulav bundle.
Whatever disqualifies the aravah of the lulav [bundle] also disqualifies





this aravah. Therefore, a Jew should not cut it himself for his own use.
(as I have written in ch. 136:7 above); the only difference [of the special
aravah] is that even if most of the leaves fell off, it is valid. Even if there
is only one leaf left on one branch, it is valid. However, the beauty of
the mitzvah is enhanced when the aravah has many leaves and a long
branch. It is a beautiful custom to take five branches [for the special
aravah] and tie them together with a leaf of a lulav.
3

You should not take this aravah together with the lulav, but when you
begin to say Ta'aneh emunim [Answer the faithful] you put down the
lulav and the esrog and take the aravah, for then we pray for water. At
the conclusion of the Hoshanos, you wave the aravah and beat it on the
ground five times, and it is sufficient, even if no leaves fall off in the
process. After beating the aravah, you should not throw it on the floor,
because it shows contempt of the mitzvah. It is best to put save it and
cast it into the fire of [the oven] when you bake matzos (for Pesach),
since it was used for one mitzvah it should be used for another mitzvah.

4

On the night of Shemini Atzeres you should wait [and be sure] not to
say the Kiddush before nightfall. In the Kiddush you should say
Shehecheyanu, because it is a Yom Tov in itself. You should not say
Leisheiv basukkah, because in the Shemoneh Esrei and in the Kiddush, we
say Yom hashemini chag ha'atzeres hazeh [the Eighth Day, this Festival of
Assembly], and if you said Leisheiv basukkah, you would be
contradicting yourself.

5

The night of Shemini Atzeres and the whole day, you should eat in the
sukkah, but you should not say the berachah [Leisheiv basukkah], as we
have mentioned. When you take final leave of the sukkah you should





say Yehi ratzon, [May it be favorable] etc. Regarding sleeping in the
sukkah, some authorities take a lenient view, and this is the accepted
custom; but it is proper to follow the stricter view.
6

On the eighth day near dark, you may remove the vessels from the
sukkah into the house; but you should not arrange them in proper
order while it is still day, for that is considered preparing on one Yom
Tov for another.

7

The last day of Yom Tov, which is also Shemini Atzeres, is called Simchas
Torah, because on this day we conclude [the reading of ] the Torah, and
we rejoice with it. In the evening, after Maariv, we make [seven]
Hakafos [circuits] carrying the Sifrei Torah around the bimah, after
which the Sifrei Torah are replaced in the Ark. We leave one Seifer Torah
from which we read for three people from the portion Vezos haberachah
[This is the blessing], (Deuteronomy 33 ). In some communities it is
customary to read the portions dealing with vows. After the reading of
the Torah, the half-kaddish is said, the Seifer Torah is replaced in the
Ark, and Aleinu is said.

8

On the day of Simchas Torah it is the custom in many communities that
the Kohanim bless the people in the Shacharis service and not in Musaf,
since during Musaf the Kohanim may be intoxicated. We do not say
Vesei'areiv [May our entreaties be pleasing] when the Kohanim bless the
people at Shacharis prayers.

9

In the daytime, after the Hakafos, three Sifrei Torah are left out, and
many people are called up to one Seifer Torah, to read the portion Vezos
haberachah up to Me'onah (Deut. 33:27 ) repeating it many times. At the





end, all the young boys are called up. It is proper that a boy who is bar
mitzvah should say the berachah and that the others should listen. The
verse Hamalach hagoel is read for them [The angel who delivered me]
etc. (Genesis 48:16 ). After that, the Chasan Torah is called up and he
reads from Me'onah to the end [of the Torah]. In the second Seifer
Torah, the Chasan Bereishis reads. Then half-kaddish is said. In the third
Seifer Torah, Maftir is read. (see chapter 79:1 above) It is the custom in
many communities to be mindful to call up an eminent person for
Chasan Torah. Even a person who was called up already for the reading
of Vezos haberachah, may still be called up as Chasan Torah or as Chasan
Bereishis. Where there are only two Sifrei Torah, Vezos haberachah should
be read in one, and Bereishis in the other one, and the first seifer is taken
again for Maftir.
10

It is customary for the Chasan Torah and the Chasan Bereishis to make
donations to charity, and to invite all their friends to a joyous meal in
honor of the completion of the Torah and its beginning. As it is written
in the Midrash, (At the beginning of Koheles [Ecclesiastes], ""He came to
Jerusalem and he stood in front of the Ark of the Covenant of Hashem""
etc. ""… and he made a banquet for all his servants."" Rabbi Yitzchak
said, ""From this we can infer, that you should make a festive meal upon
the completion of the Torah.""
"
"1

During the era of the Second Beis Hamikdash when the Greek kingdom
was in power, they imposed evil decrees against the Jewish people,
designed to put an end to their religion. They did not permit them to
study the Torah or to perform the mitzvos; they plundered their





property, [abducted] their daughters, entered the Temple, violating its
sanctity and defiling its purity. Yisrael was in great distress because of
them, for they oppressed them bitterly, until the God of our fathers
took pity on them and delivered them from their dominion, and
rescued them. The Hasmoneans, the sons of the Kohein Gadol defeated
and killed them, and delivered Yisrael from their dominion. They
appointed as king one of the Kohanim, and the Kingdom of Yisrael
returned to power and [endured] for more than two hundred years,
until the destruction of the Second Beis Hamikdash. When Yisrael
triumphed over their enemies and destroyed them, —this happened on
the twenty-fifth of Kislev—, they entered the Beis Hamikdash, and
found of the pure oil in the Beis Hamikdash only one jar, that was
stamped with the seal of the Kohein Gadol. This oil was sufficient to
burn for only one day, but they lit the lights of the Menorah with it
[and it lasted] for eight days, until they crushed olives and extracted
pure oil. For this reason the Sages of that generation ordained that these
eight days, beginning on the twenty-fifth of Kislev, should be days of
rejoicing and praise. We kindle lights in the evening near the entrance
to the house every night, during these eight nights, in order to display
and reveal the miracle. These days are called Chanukah, which means
[it is a contraction of ] chanu chaf-hei [they rested on the twenty-fifth].
For on the twenty-fifth of Kislev they rested from their enemies
[onslaughts]. Another reason [for the name Chanukah] is that during
these days they dedicated the Beis Hamikdash [Chanukas habayis], that
had been defiled by the oppressors. Some authorities say, therefore, that
it is a mitzvah to somewhat embellish the meals on Chanukah. Another
reason for celebrating Chanukah is that the construction of the Mishkan
was completed during these days. You should tell your family the story




of the miracles that were performed for our forefathers, during these
days (see Flavius Josephus). Nevertheless, a Chanukah feast is not
considered a mitzvah, unless you sing hymns and praises to Hashem
during the meal. On Chanukah you should give charity generously, for
the days of Chanukah are auspicious to correct flaws of the soul
through the giving of charity, especially when it is given to support
poor, Torah scholars.
2

Fasting is not permitted on Chanukah. However, on the day before
Chanukah and on the day after Chanukah, it is permitted to deliver a
eulogy and to fast.

3

You are permitted to work on Chanukah. But women follow the
custom, not to do any work during the time the Chanukah lights are
burning, and you should not [cause them] to treat this matter lightly.
The reason that women are more stringent about this [than men], is
that the cruelty of the evil decree was directed mainly at Jewish women.
For [the Greeks] decreed that a virgin girl before her wedding must first
cohabit with the general. Another reason for this is that the miracle
came about through a woman. The daughter of Yochanan the Kohein
Gadol was a very beautiful girl, and the ruthless king wanted her to lie
with him. She told him that she would fulfill his request; and she
served him cheese dishes, so that he would be thirsty, and drink wine;
then become intoxicated, and fall asleep. That is precisely what
happened. Then she cut off his head and brought it to Jerusalem.
When the general saw that the king was dead, he [and his army] fled.
Therefore, some people have the custom to eat dairy dishes on
Chanukah, to commemorate the miracle achieved by means of a dairy
product.




4


All kinds of oil are valid for the Chanukah lights. Nevertheless, the
mitzvah done to perfection is to use olive oil, similar to the miracle in
the Beis Hamikdash, which was achieved with olive oil. If this cannot be
obtained you should select another kind of oil that gives a clear, bright
flame, or wax candles, for they also produce clear light. You should not
use two candles braided together, for that would be like a torch; but
each candle should [burn] by itself. You should not make the candles
from wax that comes from houses of idol worship, for that is repulsive.
All wicks are valid for Chanukah lights. The mitzvah done to perfection
is to use cotton. It is not necessary to take new wicks every night, but
you may light the old wicks until they are used up.

5

If you light a menorah made of earthenware, after you light it one night
it deteriorates and you should not light it again the following night,
because it is repulsive. Therefore, you should possess a beautiful
menorah made of metal. If you can afford it, you should buy a silver
menorah, in order to adorn the mitzvah.

6

It is the widespread custom in our regions [to follow the practice] of the
most scrupulously observant, whereby each member of the family
kindles one light on the first night, two lights on the second, and keeps
adding until on the eighth night, he kindles eight lights. You should be
careful that each person places his menorah in a separate place, so that
one can easily tell how many lights are lit [that night]. The menorah
should not be lit in a place where candles are lit all year, in order to
make it manifestly clear that these are Chanukah lights.




7


It is a mitzvah to light the menorah in the doorway that opens to the
street, [public domain], in order to publicize the miracle; and it was
done in this manner in the days of the Mishnah and the Talmud. Now,
since we live among non-Jews, we light the menorah in the house, and if
you have a window facing the street, you should light it there; if not,
you should light it near the door. It is a mitzvah to place the menorah
within a tefach of the left side of the door so that the mezuzah will be
on the right and the Chanukah lights on the left, and in so doing you
find yourself surrounded by mitzvos. It is preferable to place the
menorah within the open space of the door.

8

The mitzvah requires that [the menorah] be placed higher than three
tefachim above the floor and lower than ten tefachim. But if you placed
it higher than ten tefachim you have fulfilled your obligation. However,
if you placed it higher than twenty amos you have not fulfilled your
obligation, because when it is placed higher than twenty amos it is out
of the range of vision. If you live on an upper floor you may place [the
menorah] in the window, even though it is higher than ten tefachim
from the ground. But if the window is higher than twenty amos from
the ground of the public domain, where it is out of visual range of the
people walking in the street, then it is preferable to place the lights near
the door.

9

The lights should be placed in an even row; one should not be higher
than the other. Space should be left between the lights, so that the
flames will not merge and look like a torch. Wax candles should be
separated, so they will not become heated from each other and cause
the wax to melt, and become spoiled. If you fill a dish with oil and put





wicks around it, and you place a [perforated] cover on it, each wick
counts as a separate light. If you did not place such a cover on it, it does
not even count as one light, because it resembles a torch. A lamp that
has two or more branches should not be kindled by two persons, even
on the first night, because there is no way to tell how many candles
were lit [for that night].
10

The time to light [the menorah] is immediately after the stars appear,
and you should not delay it. It is forbidden to do anything before
lighting the menorah, even to study Torah. Except, if you have not
prayed Maariv, you should first pray and then light the menorah. Before
lighting the menorah, you should gather the entire family, in order to
proclaim the event publicly. You should pour in enough oil to burn at
least half an hour. If, inadvertently, you did not light them immediately,
you may light them and say the berachos, as long as the members of
your family are still awake. However, after the family is asleep it is no
longer considered a public event, and you should light them without
saying the berachos. If you will not have time to light the menorah at
night, you may do it before that time and light the menorah from pelag
haMinchah, which is one and one-fourth hour before the stars come
out, (these are ""time-variable"" hours, measured according to the length
of daylight, see chapter 69:2 above. And in the season of Chanukah,
when the days are short, the day is only ten hours long (measured by
the clock), then pelag haMinchah, is one hour and two and one-half
minutes before the stars appear). [You may kindle the menorah then]
provided you pour in enough oil to burn until one-half hour after the
stars become visible. If the lights do not burn that long you have not
fulfilled the mitzvah.




11


According to our custom, the order of lighting the menorah is as
follows: On the first night you kindle the light facing your right hand,
on the second night you add one light to the left [of the previous
night's light]; similarly, on each subsequent night you add one light to
the left. The light that is added is always kindled first, and you continue
lighting towards the right.

12

On the first night, you recite three berachos before lighting the menorah:
Lehadlik [To kindle the Chanukah light], She'asa nisim [Who has
performed miracles], and Shehecheyanu. On the other nights you do not
say Shehecheyanu. After you say the berachos you kindle one light, and
while kindling the others, you says, Haneiros halalu [These lights] etc.
A convert to Judaism should say, ""Who has performed miracles for
Yisrael,"" but if he said ""la'avoseinu,"" [for our forefathers], he has
fulfilled his obligation. An onein [a mourner before the burial], [should
not light the menorah], but he should let someone else light the
menorah, and say the berachos, and [the onein] should respond Amein.
But if there is no one else, then he should light the menorah himself but
without saying the berachos.

13

It is a halachic rule that the act of lighting the menorah creates the
mitzvah, which means, that the kindling is the essence of the mitzvah,
and when you light the menorah the lights must be in their proper place
and must have the proper amount [of oil]. Accordingly if you lit them
when they were lower than three tefachim [off the ground] or higher
than twenty amos, and after they were already burning you placed them
in their proper place, they are not valid. Similarly, if, when you lit
them, they did not have the required amount of oil, and afterwards you





added [oil], it is of no avail. Similarly if you set the menorah in a place
where the wind is blowing and the lights are bound to be extinguished,
you have not fulfilled the mitzvah, and you must light them again, but
you should not say a berachah. But if you put them in the proper place
and they were extinguished by accident, you have fulfilled the mitzvah.
Nevertheless, it is customary to kindle them again. It is the custom to
be strict and not rekindle an extinguished light with another Chanukah
light, but you should light it with the shamash or with some other
candle.
14

During the time [they are burning] in fulfillment of the mitzvah, that
is, one-half hour, it is forbidden to have any benefit from their light. It
is the custom therefore, to place the shamash near them so that if you
use the light, [for any personal purpose] you will be using the light of
the shamash. You must place [the shamash] a little higher than the other
lights, so that it is recognized that it is not one of the required number
of lights.

15

The menorah is lit in the synagogue in order to herald the miracle
publicly and the berachos are said over them. The menorah is placed
near the southern wall, and it is kindled between Minchah and Maariv.
But you cannot fulfill your obligation with the lighting of the menorah
in the synagogue. You must light them yourself at home. A mourner
should not light the menorah in the synagogue on the first night,
because he has to say Shehecheyanu, and a mourner should not say
Shehecheyanu publicly; but he may say Shehecheyanu in his house.

16

Women are obligated to kindle the Chanukah lights, because they were
involved in the miracle of Chanukah, (see paragraph 3 above). A





woman may light the menorah on behalf of her entire family. A child
who has reached the age to be trained [for mitzvos] must also light the
menorah. If a blind person can become someone's partner by
contributing towards buying the Chanukah lights, fulfilling his
obligation through his partner's lighting that would be best. If he has a
wife, she should light the menorah for him; but if he has no wife and
lives by himself, so that he cannot become anyone's partner, he should
light it with someone's assistance.
17

On erev Shabbos you should first kindle the Chanukah lights, then the
Shabbos candles but it should be after pelag haMinchah. Before lighting
them you should pray Minchah. You must put in enough oil to keep
them burning until one-half hour after the stars come out, otherwise
the berachos you say over them are in vain. If you light the menorah near
the door, you must be careful to place something between it and the
door, so that the wind will not blow it out when the door is opened and
closed.

18

On Shabbos night you should recite Havdalah and then kindle the
Chanukah lights. In the synagogue the lights are kindled before Veyiten
lecha is said.

19

If you are away from home,—out of town; if you know that your wife
lights the menorah at home, you should light it wherever you are
without saying the berachos. If possible, it is best to hear the berachos
from someone who is lighting the menorah there, and have in mind to
fulfill your obligation with his berachos, respond Amein, and after that,
kindle the menorah, without saying the berachos. But if your wife does
not light the menorah at home; similarly, yeshivah students boarding





with a family must light the menorah and say the berachos or else, they
should become partners with the head of the household by giving him
several coins, and thus they will also own a share of the oil and the
wick. The head of the household should add a bit more oil than is
required for the partner [or partners]. They should, however, make an
effort to light their own menorah. If you are in town but in someone
else's house, when it is time to light the menorah you must return home
and light it.
20

The oil that is left in the menorah after Chanukah, as well as the wicks,
should be burnt in a bonfire, because they were set aside for a mitzvah.
It is forbidden to derive any benefit from them, unless you had made a
provision beforehand that you do not set aside what will be left [after
Chanukah].

21

During the eight days of Chanukah we say in the Shemoneh Esreih Al
hanisim [For the miracles]. If you forgot to say it, and become aware of
it before you said the Name of God in the berachah Hatov shimecha
[""The Beneficent is Your Name,"" etc.], you should turn back and start
Al hanisim. But if you became aware of it after you pronounced the
Name of God, you should conclude the berachah and not turn back [to
Al hanisim]. (Concerning Birkas Hamazon see Chapter 44:16 above.)

22

During the eight days of Chanukah we recite the complete Halleil, and
we do not say Tachanun, nor Keil erech apayim, nor Lamenatzei'ach nor
Tzidkasecha tzedek. (For the halachah concerning the saying of Halleil in
a mourner's house, see Chapter 207:6 below).




23


Each day [of Chanukah] we call up three men [for the reading of the
Torah] from the chapter ""The Offerings of the Princes"" in the weekly
portion of Naso. On the first day we begin to read for the kohein, from
Vayehi beyom kalos Moshe, [On the day that Moses completed]
(Numbers 7:1 ) until Lachanukas hamizbei'ach, [For the dedication of the
altar]; for the Levi, Vayehi hamakriv bayom harishon, [The one to bring
his offering on the first day] etc. until melei'ah ketores [Filled with
incense]. For the Yisrael, Par echad, [One young bull] etc., until Ben
Aminadav. On the second day for the kohein and the Levi, we read,
Bayom hasheini [On the second day] etc., and for the Yisrael, Bayom
hashelishi, [On the third day] etc. Similarly, on each subsequent day for
the kohein and the Levi we read of the current day's offering, and for
the Yisrael, the offering of the next day. On the eighth day, for the
kohein and the Levi, we read, Bayom hashemini [On the eighth day]
etc., and for the Yisrael we begin with Bayom hatesh'i, [On the ninth
day], completing the entire parashah, and we continue in parashas
Beha'alosecha, until kein asa es hamenorah, [So did he make the
menorah] (Numbers 8:4 ).

24

On Shabbos Chanukah, two sifrei Torah are taken out of the Ark. In the
first one we read the weekly portion; and in the other we read the
Maftir the ""day"" that corresponds to the current day of Chanukah. We
read the Haftarah, Roni vesimchi [Sing and rejoice] (Zechariah 2:14 ). If
another Shabbos occurs on Chanukah, we read for Maftir [on the
second Shabbos Chanukah] from Melachim I (First Kings) 7:40 where
the menorohs of Solomon [are mentioned]. If Rosh Chodesh Teiveis
occurs on a weekday, two sifrei Torah are taken out of the Ark. In the
first one we read the portion of Rosh Chodesh for three men; we then





read for the fourth person in the other seifer Torah the reading of the
current day of Chanukah, because Rosh Chodesh is more frequent [than
Chanukah], and it is an halachic rule, when a regular practice [conflicts
with] an occasional practice the regular practice takes precedence.
Therefore, the the Rosh Chodesh reading takes precedence. If, by
mistake, the portion of Chanukah is read first; and even if the reading
has not yet begun, but the one called up had already said the berachah,
there is no need to interrupt, and the reading should be concluded.
After that, they should read for the other aliyos the portion of Rosh
Chodesh. If they read the portion of Rosh Chodesh in the first [seifer
Torah], as indeed they should, but by mistake, they called up the fourth
person also to the portion of Rosh Chodesh, even if they became aware
of it immediately after he said the [concluding] berachah, then, if only
one seifer Torah was taken out, no further reading is required. But if two
sifrei Torah were taken out, and there is reason to fear that the [unused]
seifer Torah will be slighted, because people will wrongly conclude that
it is defective, a fifth person must be called for whom the portion of
Chanukah is read. After this fifth aliyah, the half-kaddish is recited.
25

If Rosh Chodesh Teiveis occurs on Shabbos, three sifrei Torah are taken
out. In the first one, six men are called up for the reading of the
parashah of the week. To the second seifer Torah, a seventh person is
called for the reading of Rosh Chodesh, beginning from Uveyom
haShabbos [And on the Sabbath day] (see Chapter 78:1 and Chapter
79:1 above). Then [half-kaddish] is said. In the third seifer Torah, Maftir
is read, from the nasi of the current Chanukah day. For the Haftarah we
read Roni vesimchi. Although the more frequent takes precedence, this
rule applies only to Torah reading, where both [Rosh Chodesh and
Chanukah] are read, but in the case of the Haftarah where only one is





read, we put aside Rosh Chodesh and read the Haftarah of Chanukah, to
publicize the miracle.
26

The fifteenth day of Shevat is ""Rosh Hashanah for Trees."" We do not say
Tachanun on that day, and it is the custom to eat many different kinds
of tree-grown fruit.
"
"1

The Shabbos before Rosh Chodesh Adar that is closest to the month of
Nisan, is [called] Shabbos, Parashas Shekalim. If Rosh Chodesh occurs on
Shabbos, then that Shabbos is Parashas Shekalim. We take out three
sifrei Torah. We call six persons to the first seifer Torah, for the reading
of the weekly portion. In the second seifer Torah we call a seventh
person for the reading of Rosh Chodesh, beginning with Uve'yom
haShabbos. Then half-kaddish is said (see Chaper 78:1 and 79:1 above).
In the third seifer Torah we read the Maftir of Parashas Shekalim,
[Exodus 30:11–16 ], and the Haftarah of Parashas Shekalim is read. If by
mistake they began to read the section of Parashas Shekalim first, they
should finish reading it, and for Maftir they should read the section of
Rosh Chodesh, and the Haftarah, too, is that of Shabbos Rosh Chodesh.

2

The Shabbos before Purim is [called] Shabbos, Parashas Zachor. The
Shabbos before Rosh Chodesh Nisan is Shabbos, Parashas Hachodesh. If
Rosh Chodesh Nisan occurs on Shabbos, then that Shabbos is Parashas
Hachodesh, and it is governed by the same Halachos as apply when Rosh
Chodesh Adar occurs on Shabbos. The Shabbos before Parashas
Hachodesh is Shabbos, Parashas Parah.




3


Some authorities maintain that Parashas Zachor and Parashas Parah are
obligated to be read, according to Scriptural law, and a minor should
not be called for the maftir [reading of those parshiyos]. People living in
villages who have no minyan are required to go to a place where there is
a minyan. If that is impossible, they should at least read these [special
portions] with the proper cantillation chant.

The Month of Adar brings much joy to our people. If a Jew has a
lawsuit against a non-Jew he should bring the case to court during this
month.

2

In the days of Mordechai and Esther, the Jews joined together on the
thirteenth day of Adar to defend themselves and take revenge against
their enemies. They had to ask for compassion from God, blessed is His
Name, that He should help them. And we find that whenever the
Jewish people were at war they fasted, in order to invoke Divine
assistance. Moshe Rabeinu, peace be upon him, also fasted on the day
he went into battle against Amalek. This being the case, we may
assume, that in the days of Mordechai and Esther, they also fasted on
the thirteenth day of Adar. Therefore, all Jews have accepted this day as
a public fast day. It is called Ta'anis Esther [Fast of Esther]. It is meant
to remind us that the Creator, blessed is His Name, sees and hears the
prayers of every person in his time of trouble, when he fasts and repents
with all his heart, as He answered our forefathers in those days.
Nevertheless, this fast is not as obligatory as the four fast days
mentioned in Tanach (see Chapter 121 above). Therefore, you may be





lenient when it is necessary. Thus pregnant and nursing women, or
even a person who is slightly ill with an eye irritation should not fast, if
fasting would be greatly discomforting to them. A woman within thirty
days after giving birth, and a bridegroom during his seven days of Sheva
berachos, do not have to fast, but they should make up for it later. But
all others who are in good health should not separate themselves from
the community. Even if you are traveling and fasting is difficult,
nevertheless, you are required to fast.
3

On the fourteenth day of Adar, Purim is celebrated in unwalled cities. If
Purim occurs on a Sunday, the fast is moved up to Thursday. If there is
a bris [circumcision] on [Thursday], the bris meal should be held at
night, but the sandek and the father of the infant are permitted to eat
during the day, and they do not have to fast on Friday. But if anyone
else forgets and eats on Thursday, he must fast on Friday.

4

In honor of [reading] the Megillah you should wear Shabbos clothes in
the evening, and when returning from the synagogue, you should find
the house brightly lit, the table set, and the beds made. In the evening,
after the Shemoneh Esrei, the Full Kaddish with Tiskabbeil is said, then
the Megillah is read. After that, Ve'ata kadosh etc. is said. (This verse is
found in Psalm 22:4 , ""For the Conductor; on the ayeles hashachar,""
which refers to Esther. It is said (verse 3), ""My God, I call…"" etc.
which refers to the reading of the Megillah. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi
said, Every man must read the Megillah at night and repeat it in the
daytime, for it is said, ""My God, I call by day, but you do not answer,
and at night I am not silent."" This is followed by [the verse], ""You are
the Holy One"" etc.). After that, the Full Kaddish, is said, omitting
Tiskabbeil. If it is Shabbos night [we say], Vihi no'am, Ve'ata kadosh, the





Full Kaddish omitting Tiskabbeil, Veyiten lecha; and we say Havdalah
over a cup of wine, [and conclude with] Aleinu.
5

It is customary to donate a coin, equal to half of the standard monetary
unit currently in use in the country before Purim, as a reminder of the
half-shekel, the Jews used to give in Adar to buy the communal
offerings. It is customary to give three half-shekels, because in Parashas
Ki Sisa, the word terumah [offering] is mentioned three times. These
coins are given in the evening before the reading of the Megillah, and
then distributed to the poor. A minor is exempt [from giving the halfshekel]; but if his father once contributed for him, it remains his
obligation for life. According to some authorities, a thirteen year old
boy must give [a half-shekel], while others hold that he is exempt until
he reaches the age of twenty.

6

On Purim, in the Shemoneh Esrei of Maariv, Shacharis, and Minchah,
we recite Al hanisim [For the miracles]. If you forgot to say it, the same
Halachah applies as on Chanukah. [See Chapter 139:21]

7

It is an obligation upon everyone, both men and women, to hear the
reading of the Megillah in the evening and during the day. Therefore,
girls too, should go to the synagogue. If they do not go someone must
read for them at home. Children too, must be trained to hear the
reading of the Megillah. Nevertheless, you should not bring very young
children to the synagogue since they disturb the congregation.

8

At night it is forbidden to read the Megillah before the stars come out,
even if you suffer great discomfort because of the fast. But you may





taste something before the reading of the Megillah, such as coffee, and
similar beverages, to strengthen yourself from the exhaustion of the fast.
9

The mitzvah done to perfection is to hear the Megillah in the
synagogue, where there is a large number of people, for ""In the
multitude of people is the splendor of the King"" (Proverbs 14:28 ). You
should at least make an effort to hear it read with a minyan. If it is
impossible to have it read with a minyan, each individual should read it
from a valid Megillah, and recite the berachos before the reading. If one
of them knows how to read it and the others do not, then the one who
knows it should read and the others should listen and fulfill their
obligation in this manner, even though they are not a minyan.
However, the berachah after the Megillah reading should be said only
when there is a minyan. However, without mentioning God's name and
Kingship [i.e., Elokeinu melech ha'olam], even an individual may recite
the berachah.

10

It is a custom, accepted in all Yisrael, that the reader does not read from
a rolled up Megillah, but he spreads it out and folds it, section over
section, like a letter, because the Megillah is called Igeres haPurim [the
letter of Purim]; but those who listen, do not have to spread out their
Megillos.

11

The person who reads the Megillah, whether in the daytime or at night,
recites three berachos before the reading: Al mikra Megillah […
concerning the mitzvah of reading the Megillah], She'asa nisim, [Who
made miracles] and Shehecheyanu [Who kept us alive]. After the
reading, he rolls it up completely and places it in front of him. Then
[everyone] says the berachah Harav es riveinu, [Who fights for us] etc.





If a mourner reads the Megillah, someone else should say the berachos,
because of the Shehecheyanu [which a mourner should not say publicly].
(See 139:15)
12

When Shehecheyanu is said in the daytime you should also have in mind
[to exempt with this berachah] the mitzvos of sending Mishloach Manos
[gifts of food], Matanos La'evyonim [gifts to the poor], and Se'udas
Purim [the Purim feast]. The reader, too, [when saying Shehecheyanu],
should have the congregation in mind for these mitzvos as well.

13

The reader of the Megillah must have in mind to fulfill the mitzvah on
behalf of all the listeners. The listeners, too, must have in mind to fulfill
their obligation [with his reading] and they must listen to every word.
If you failed to hear even one word you have not fulfilled your
obligation. The reader, therefore, must be very alert, during the noise
making and the confusion, when the name of Haman is mentioned, to
remain silent until the commotion has passed completely. Nevertheless,
it is proper and fitting to have a valid [handwritten] Megillah, so that
you can say word for word quietly, in case you do not hear one word
from the reader. Also, every intelligent woman who is in the women's
section is encouraged, if possible, to obtain a valid Megillah from which
to read, for in the [women's section] it is difficult to hear [the reading];
and women are obligated [to hear the Megillah] the same as men. (If
kiddush levanah [Sanctification of the Moon] has not yet been said, and
it became visible during the reading of the Megillah, see the end of
Chapter 97 above [for instructions].)

14

The reader must recite the names of the ten sons of Haman, including
the word aseres [ten], all in one breath, to make it known that they were





all killed and hanged simultaneously. It is customary [at least] initially
to recite from chameish meios ish [Five hundred men] all in one breath.
If he has already read the names, then even if he paused while reciting
the names of the ten sons of Haman, he has fulfilled his obligation. The
custom followed in some communities, that the entire congregation
says the names of the sons of Haman, is not correct. Rather the reader
should recite them, and the congregation should listen as they do for
the entire Megillah. When the reader says the verse, ""That night the
king could not sleep well"" (6:1) he should raise his voice, for there the
actual miracle begins; and when he says ""Ha'igeres hazos,"" [this letter]
(9:26) he should [gently] shake the Megillah.
15

If you have a Megillah that is invalid, or a Chumash, you should not say
the words along with the reader, because if you say the words while
reading, you cannot concentrate on listening to the reader. And even if
you, yourself, could concentrate [on the reader's recitation], someone
else might listen to your reading and not concentrate on the reader's
recitation. For the same reason, no one should assist the reader from
memory. Therefore, the four ""verses of redemption"" [Verse 2:5, Ish
Yehudi—There was a Jewish man, v. 8:15, uMordechai yatzah—
Mordechai left, v. 8:16, LaYehudim hayesa—The Jews had light, v. 10:3,
Ki Mordechai HaYehudi—For Mordechai the Jew,] which the
congregation recites in a loud voice, must be repeated by the reader and
read from the valid Megillah.

16

Someone who has already fulfilled the Mitzvah of reading the Megillah,
may read in order to exempt someone else. If the one for whose benefit
he reads knows how to say the berachos, then he should say the berachos.
If [he reads it for] a woman, it is preferable that the reader says the





following berachah: Asher kiddeshanu bemitzvosav vetzivanu lishmo'a
megillah. [Who has sanctified us with His commandments and has
commanded us to hear the Megillah].
17

On Shabbos (on which Purim never occurs) it is permissible to handle
the Megillah. Nevertheless, if Purim occurs on Sunday, you should not
bring the Megillah to the synagogue on Shabbos even in a city which
has an eiruv, because it is preparing on Shabbos for a weekday.

18

If a congregation has no reader capable of reading the Megillah with the
proper cantillation chant, it may be read without the chant, provided
the words are properly pronounced, so that the meaning is not
changed. For, if instead of reading uMordechai yosheiv (is sitting) [it was
read] yashav (sat) or instead of [reading] veHaman nofeil [Haman is
falling], it was read nafal [fell], or the like, even post facto, the mitzvah
is not fulfilled. It is permissible to insert vowels and cantillation marks
in the Megillah, so that it should be read correctly, since it is an extreme
circumstance; and this is better than having someone prompt [the
reader] from of a chumash, whispering quietly, because the prompter,
who is reading out of a chumash, even if he reads in an undertone,
cannot concentrate on listening to the reader's recitation. The result is,
that he only reads it out of a chumash, and has not fulfilled the mitzvah.
If this happened [the prompter] must hear it again read out of a valid
Megillah.

19

If a congregation does not have a halachically valid Megillah,
nevertheless, if it is written on parchment according to Halachah,
except that some words are missing in mid text, since no complete
subject is missing, it may be read from, and the berachos may be said





over it. The reader should say the missing words from memory or
someone should prompt him quietly from a chumash. But if they have
no Megillah at all, or if an entire subject is missing, or if the first or last
[verses] are missing, then each person should read from a chumash
without saying the berachos. An individual who has only a Megillah that
is not valid should read in it, without saying the berachos.
20

A mourner during the shivah should observe all the Halachos of
mourning, and he is forbidden to attend any kind of celebration; but
wearing shoes and sitting on a chair are permitted [to him on Purim],
because these are things that everyone can see. At night, if he can gather
a minyan in his house to read the Megillah, that is preferable; if not, he
should pray at home and go to the synagogue to hear the Megillah. If
Purim occurs on Shabbos night, he should go to the synagogue after
Shalosh Seudos [the third meal] while it is still day. On Purim-day he
may go to the synagogue to pray and to hear the Megillah.

21

If someone lost a close relative on the Fast of Esther and at night he is
an onein, since the burial has not yet taken place, he should hear the
Megillah read by someone else; and he should not eat meat nor drink
wine, since at night feasting is not mandatory. In the daytime, after
leaving the synagogue, the dead should be buried. Afterwards he should
pray, and either read the Megillah himself or hear someone else read it.
If he heard the reading of the Megillah before the burial, he has fulfilled
his obligation. Nevertheless, it is proper that he read it again without
saying the berachos. He should not put on the tefillin even after the
burial, because it is the first day of mourning. An onein, on Purim
during the daytime, is permitted to eat meat and drink wine.




22


In the morning [it is proper] to get up early to go to the synagogue.
After the Shemoneh Esrei, half-kaddish is said. We call up three persons
for the Torah-reading of Parashas Vayavo Amalek [And Amelek came]
(Ex. 17:8 ), after which half-kaddish is said. After the seifer Torah is
placed in the Ark, the Megillah is read. After the last berachah [over the
Megillah], in the morning, we do not say Asher heini [Who annuls the
counsel of the nations]. After concluding the berachah with hakeil
hamoshia [the God Who brings salvation] we say Shoshanas Yaakov
[The rose of Jacob] etc. then Ashrei, Uva leTzion, Full-Kaddish
including Tiskabbeil. You should not take off the tefillin until after the
reading of the Megillah, because in the Megillah it is written, Vikar [and
honor] (8:16), and [our Rabbis] expound that this refers to the tefillin.
If there is a bris, it is performed before the reading of the Megillah,
because it is written vesason [gladness], which refers to bris milah.

23

In a city that has been surrounded by a wall since the days of Joshua the
son of Nun, the Megillah is read on the fifteenth of Adar (such cities do
not exist in our regions).
"
"1

[On Purim] everyone is required to send no less than two gifts to one
person; as it is written, ""And sending gifts of food to one another""
(9:22); which implies two gifts to one person. The more gifts you send
to your friends the more praiseworthy you are. Nevertheless, it is much
better to give generously to the poor than to have a lavish feast and to
send extravagant gifts to your friends; for there is no greater and more
glorious joy before the Holy One, blessed is He, than to gladden the





hearts of the poor, the orphans and the widows. Whoever gladdens the
hearts of these unfortunates is compared to the Divine Presence, for it
is said, (Isaiah 57:15 ) ""To revive the spirit of the humble and revive the
heart of the crushed.""
2

The term Mishlo'ach manos implies only food that is ready-to-eat
without preparation [by the recipient], such as cooked meat or fish, but
not if it is uncooked. Candy, fruits, wine, mead, or similar [delicacies
are acceptable].

3

Everybody, even the poorest in Yisrael, who is a recipient of charity, is
required to give at least two gifts to two poor persons, that is, one gift
to each person, for it is written, Matanos l'evyonim ""And gifts to the
poor,"" (9:22) [leveyonim is a plural] which implies, two gifts to two
poor people. You should not be selective when giving charity on Purim;
whoever holds out his hand to ask for charity should be given a
donation. If you are in a community where there are no poor people,
you should either keep the money until you meet needy persons, or
send it to them.

4

Women, too, are required to send mishlo'ach manos [gifts of food] and
to give gifts to the poor. Women should send mishlo'ach manos to
women and men to men. But regarding donations to the poor, women
may send to men, and conversely, [men may send to women]. Some
women rely that their husbands give on their behalf as well, but this is
not proper; rather they should be stringent about this.

5

It is an obligation to eat, drink and to rejoice on Purim. Also on the
night of the fourteenth you should rejoice and have a more elaborate





meal [than usual]. If Purim occurs on Shabbos night, although you
must have a third meal on Shabbos, you should eat a little less during
the day to leave some appetite for the meal of Purim night.
Nevertheless, by having a meal at night you have not fulfilled the
mitzvah [of se'udas Purim, the Purim feast]; for the mitzvah if to have
the main Purim feast during the daytime, for it is written, ""Days of
feasting."" You should light candles as you do on joyous occasions and
Yom Tov, even when the meal is held in the daytime. Also on the night
of the fifteenth you should celebrate a little. Giving gifts to the poor
and sending mishlo'ach manos to friends must be done during the
daytime. Since people are busy [preparing and delivering] mishlo'ach
manos, part of the Purim se'udah may extend into the night. You should
pray Minchah while it is still the middle of the day, and have the se'udah
after Minchah. At any rate, you should have the greater part of the
se'udah while it is still day. When Purim occurs on erev Shabbos, you
should have the se'udah in the morning, out of respect for Shabbos. It is
commendable to devote some time to Torah study, before beginning
the se'udah. This is based [on the verse] ""The Jews had light,"" (8:16)
and [our Rabbis] expound, ""light"" means Torah. Some authorities, say
that you should eat different kinds of seeds on Purim, to commemorate
the seeds Daniel and his friends ate in Babylon, and also to remember
the seeds that Esther ate. For the Talmud (Maseches Megillah 16b)
states, [it is written] ""He favored her and her maids with preferential
treatment…"" (2:9) [this means], that he gave her seeds for her food.
(For the laws of Al hanisim in Birkas Hamazon, see Chapter 44:16, 17.)
6

Since the entire miracle of Purim was brought about through wine:
Vashti was banished at the wine party, and Esther took her place; also
the episode of Haman's downfall came about through wine; therefore,





our Rabbis of blessed memory mandated that everyone should become
intoxicated with wine, and they said, ""It is an obligation to become
intoxicated on Purim, until you cannot tell the difference between
'Cursed be Haman' and 'Blessed be Mordechai.'"" At least you should
drink more than you usually do, to recall the great miracle, until you
fall asleep; and once you are asleep, you can no longer tell the difference
between ""Cursed is Haman"" and ""Blessed is Mordechai."" However, if a
person is physically frail, and similarly, if you know that as a result of
[drinking] you will, God forbid, ignore a mitzvah, a berachah, or a
prayer, or that it would lead to lightheaded exuberance, it is better not
to become drunk. All your deeds should be for the sake of Heaven.
7

A mourner, even during the week of shivah is required to give gifts to
the poor, and to send mishlo'ach manos to his friends. Nevertheless, he
should not send anything that generates happiness. But you should not
send mishlo'ach manos to a mourner the entire twelve months [of
mourning], [this includes] even things that do not generate joyousness.
If [the mourner] is a poor person you may send him money or anything
that will not produce joy. If in an area where the only residents are a
mourner and one other person, he must send mishlo'ach manos to [the
mourner] in order to fulfill the mitzvah of mishlo'ach manos. (For the
laws of onein see Chapter 141:21 above).

8

You should not do any work on Purim. Whoever performs work on
that day, will never see any blessing from that work. But it is permitted
to have a non-Jew work for you. You are allowed to attend to business.
You may write even a social letter, and [make an entry of ] money you
owe, or [write] anything that does not require much concentration. You
are certainly [permitted] to write for the sake of a mitzvah or to do any





work for the purpose of a mitzvah. For the needs of Purim, you are
permitted to do even full-scale labor.
9

The fifteenth day of Adar is called Shushan Purim. We do not say
Tachanun on that day, nor Keil erech apayim nor Lamenatzei'ach. On
this day it is also forbidden to deliver eulogies or to fast. It is the
custom to celebrate on that day by feasting and rejoicing in
moderation; but we do not say Al hanisim, and weddings may be
performed because the Megillah is not read [on Shushan Purim.]
However, [on Purim], when the Megillah is read which is the
paramount time of joy, weddings should not be held, because we do
not merge one joyous event with another.

10

On the fourteenth and fifteenth day of the first Adar (in a leap year),
likewise, we do not say Tachanun, nor Keil erech apayim, nor
Lamenatzei'ach, and it is forbidden to deliver eulogies or fast on these
days, and on the fourteenth our meal should be a little more elaborate.
"
"1

You must be extremely careful to honor and revere your father and
mother for Scripture compares their honor and reverence to the honor
and reverence you must have for the Almighty. It is written, ""Honor
your father and mother;"" It is also written, ""Honor Hashem with your
substance."" With regards to your father and mother it is written, ""Every
man must revere his mother and his father;"" and it is written, ""You
shall fear Adonoy your God."" Just as He commanded us to honor and
fear His great Name so He commanded us to honor and revere them.
Three partners share in the formation of man: The Holy One, Blessed





is He, his father, and his mother. (The man contributes, the woman
contributes, and the Holy One, Blessed is He, breathes a soul into him,
endows him with eye sight, hearing and speech.) When man honors his
father and mother, the Holy One, Blessed is He, says, ""I account it to
them as though I dwelt among them, and they honored Me.""
2

How are they to be revered? You must not occupy his [your father's]
designated place in the council of elders and with his friends, or the
designated place in which he prays, and you must not sit in his
designated place at his dining table. You must not contradict his words,
or even corroborate his words in his presence, even to say ""Father is
right."" To what extent must you revere them? If you were dressed in
costly clothing and presiding over the assembly and your father or
mother came and tore your clothing, struck you on the head and spat
in your face, you must not embarrass them, or show distress in their
presence or anger towards them; but you must be silent and fear the
King who is King of Kings, the Holy One, Blesed is He, Who so
commanded. But you may summon them to Beis Din for the damages
they inflicted on you.

3

How are they to be honored? You should provide them with food and
drink, with clothing and shelter, escort them to their home and escort
them from their home. You must provide these services cheerfully, for
even if you provide them daily with choice poultry but do so with ill
grace you will incur Divine punishment.

4

If your father or mother is asleep and the key to your store is under
their pillow, it is forbidden to awaken them even if it means losing a
large profit. However, if your father would profit by being awakened





and if not awakened will be distressed by the loss of profit, it is a
mitzvah to wake him since that will make him happy Likewise, it is a
mitzvah to waken him to go to the synagogue or to perform any other
mitzvah because everyone is obligated to honor the Holy One, Blessed
is He.
5

If you need a favor from the townsmen and you know they will grant
your wish for your father's sake, even though you know that they
would also do it for your sake, you should not say, ""Do it for my sake,""
but rather, ""Do it for me for my father's sake,"" in order to attribute the
honor to your father.

6

If you did something your mother told you to do and subsequently
your father asks you, ""Who told you to do this?"" and you sense that if
you said your mother told you, your father will be angry at your
mother, you must not say to him that your mother told you to do it,
even though as a result, your father will be angry with you.

7

You must stand up in the presence of your father and your mother.

8

You must honor your parents even after their death. If you mention
them within twelve months after their passing, whether you do so orally
or in writing you should say or write, ""May I be an atonement in his
stead"" (i.e., I take (accept) upon myself all the evil [punishment] that
would be inflicted upon his soul), or may I be an atonement in her
stead. After twelve months have transpired (since he would have already
received any punishment due him, for [even] the judgement in
Gehinom of the wicked of Israel does not exceed twelve months), you
should say or write, ""May his memory be a blessing in the life of the





World to Come"" or ""May her memory be a blessing in the life of the
World to Come.""
9

Even if your father is wicked and a sinner you must honor and fear
him. Even a bastard is obligated to honor and fear his father. Others say
you need not honor your father, if he is wicked, so long as he did not
repent, but you are forbidden to cause him grief. You should be
stringent and follow the first opinion.

10

If you see your father transgress a Scriptural [Torah] Law, you must not
say to him, ""You transgressed a Scriptural [Torah] Law."" Rather say to
him, ""Father, is such and such not written in the Torah,"" as though you
are asking him a question and not as though you are admonishing him.
Your father will then himself realize [his error] and thus will not be
humiliated.

11

If your father told you to transgress a Scriptural Law whether it be a
positive or negative command or even a Rabbinical injunction, you
must not obey him, for it is written, ""Every man shall revere his mother
and father and you shall preserve My Shabbos, I am Adonoy your
God."" Shabbos is positioned in the same verse [that instructs you to
fear] your father and mother to teach: ""Even though I command you to
fear your father and mother, if your parent tells you to desecrate the
Shabbos you must not listen to him. This is true for all the mitzvos.
[For] I am Adonoy your God. Both you and your father are bound to
honor Me. You must therefore not listen to him to disregard My word.""
Rabbinical injunctions are also the commands of Hashem, Blessed be
His Name, as it is written, ""You shall not turn aside,"" etc. If your father
told you not to speak to a certain person, and not to forgive him; but





you would like to be reconciled; you should not be concerned with
your father's order, as you are forbidden to hate any Jew unless you see
him commit a sin. Thus your father has ordered you to transgress a law
of the Torah.
12

If you want to go to a certain place to study Torah because there you
will accomplish more than you will here, and your father disapproves
for some reason, you do not have to listen to your father, for learning
Torah is greater than the precept of honoring father and mother.
(Similarly, we find that when our father Yaakov, peace unto him, went
away from [his father] Yitzchok, he secreted himself in the Beis Midrash
of Eiver for 14 years and immersed himself in Torah study. Afterwards,
he went to Lavan's house and stayed away twenty two years, including
journey time. He was punished for the twenty two years during which
he did not fulfill the mitzvah of honoring his father, and Joseph's
whereabouts was concealed from Him for twenty-two years, but for the
fournteen years during which he studied Torah, he was not punished.)
If the son wishes to get married and the father disapproves he need not
listen to him.

13

Both men and women are obligated to respect their father and mother.
However, a married woman owes her devotion to her husband and is
thus exempt from honoring her father and mother. But if her husband
has no objection, she is obligated to honor them as much as possible.

14

Whoever disgraces his father or mother even by words or gesture is
among those whom the Almighty has cursed. As it said, ""Cursed is one
who disgraces his father or mother.""




15


If your parent has a splinter you should not remove it for you might
thereby make a wound (which is a prohibition punishable by
strangulation). Also, if the son is a doctor, he may not bleed them and
may not perform surgery on them, even though his intent is to cure
them. This is true only when someone else can do it. But if no one else
is available to do it, and they are suffering, he may bleed them and
operate, as is required for healing.

16

If senility or insanity should effect the mind of your father or mother,
you should try to deal with them in accordance with their mental status
until Hashem will have mercy on them. But if it is impossible for you
to endure because of their severe retardation, you may leave them, and
delegate others to take proper care of them.

17

It is forbidden to place a burdensome yoke on your children, and be
exacting in demanding honor from them, so as not to cause them to
sin. You should rather forgive them, and overlook things, for if a father
waives his honor his honor is waived.

18

It is forbidden to hit your grown up son. Grown up, in this context,
does not refer to age but on the nature of your son. If there is reason to
believe he will attack you either verbally or physically, even if he is not
yet Bar Mitzvah, you are forbidden to hit him. Instead you should
admonish him with words. Anyone who hits his grown up son is to be
excommunicated for he transgresses the Divine Command, ""Do not
place a stumbling block before the blind.""

19

You must honor your father's wife even though she is not your mother,
so long as your father is alive. You are also obligated to honor your





mother's husband during your mother's lifetime, and it is proper to
honor them even after the passing of your father or mother.
20

You must honor your older brother, regardless if he is a brother from
your paternal or maternal parent. You must honor your father-in-law
and your mother-in-law (as we find that King David, peace be upon
him, honored King Saul, who was his father-in-law and called him,
""My father,"" as he said to him, ""My father, see and observe""). You must
honor your father's father but honor due your father exceeds that of
your grandfather.

21

One who truly wishes to honor his father and his mother should
involve himself in Torah study and good deeds, for the greatest honor
to parents is when people say, ""Fortunate are the father and mother
who have reared such a son."" If the son does not walk in the right path,
his parents suffer humiliation because of him, and he embarrasses them
with the utmost embarrassment. Also, the father who truly has
compassion on his children will involve himself in Torah study and
good deeds, and will please God and mankind, and his children will be
proud of him. But he who does not walk in the right path brings
disgrace on his children. Also children die because of the iniquity of
their fathers as it is written, ""Visiting the iniquity of fathers on
children."" There is no greater cruelty than causing his children to die of
his sins. Nobody has more compassion on his children than the
righteous man, for his merit endures for a thousand generations.

22

A convert must not curse his non-Jewish father and he must not
humiliate him; in order that they not say: ""We came from a holiness





[religion] that is significant to a holiness that is inferior."" He should
treat them with some degree of respect.
"
"1

You must honor and fear your Rebbe [teacher] more than your father,
because your father [only] brought you to life in this world, but your
Rebbe brings you to life in the World to Come.

2

It is written, ""In the presence of the elderly you shall rise and you shall
respect an elder."" ""An elder,"" in this context refers to a Torah scholar as
it is said, ""Gather to me seventy men from the elders of Yisrael"" (and
there certainly the situation called for wisdom as it is written, ""Whom
you know to be the elders of the people and its officers."") Therefore, it
is a positive command to rise before a Torah scholar who is
distinguished in the knowledge of Torah, even if he is not advanced in
years and is not your teacher. It is also a mitzvah to rise before an
elderly person if he is at least seventy years old, even if he is an ignorant
person, provided he is not a wicked person. Even to an elderly person
who is not Jewish, you should talk respectfully and give him a helping
hand.

3

When three people, (one of whom is a Rav,) are walking together, the
Rav should walk in the middle. The other two should fall back slightly
and walk at his side, the older one on the right and the younger one on
the left.

4

It is a grave sin to humiliate talmidei chachomim or to hate them.
Jerusalem was not destroyed until they began to humiliate talmidei





chachomim, as it is said, ""But they mocked the messengers of God and
disgraced His words, and scoffed at His prophets."" That is to say they
humiliated those who teach His words. This is also what the Torah says,
""And if you will despise My statutes,"" [that is to say] ""If you despise
those who teach My statutes."" And anyone who humiliates Torah
scholars has no portion in the World to Come, and he is included
among those of whom it is said: ""For He has denigrated the word of
Adonoy."" It is forbidden to make servile use of one who studies Torah
laws.
5

If a Torah scholar has merchandise to sell we do not permit anyone to
sell such merchandise until he sells his merchandise. This is true only
when there is no gentile selling such merchandise. But if a gentile is
selling [such merchandise] this is not so because the Torah scholar will
not profit from this, and it will needlessly cause loss to the other Jews.

6

To be accepted as a Torah scholar in his generation, one must be
competent to discuss and debate topics of [the Written and Oral]
Torah, and have proper understanding of most of the Talmud and
Codes of Law, and Torah study is his main occupation. Even if he has a
profession or a business with which to support himself, and provide the
needs of his family, but not [necessarily] to amass wealth; and whenever
he is free from his occupation he studies Torah; [if all these
requirements apply to him then] according to the Law he is exempt
from all forms of taxes and levies even if he is wealthy. And even the
personal tax that is incumbent upon each person, the townsmen are
obligated to pay for him. [However] everything is dependent on the
discretion of the elected town leaders.




7


A scholar who slights the mitzvos and is not God-fearing, is to be
treated like the insignificant men of the community.

8

When a kohein and an Israelite are equal in Torah scholarship it is a
positive Scriptural mitzvah to give precedence to the kohein, as it is said,
""You shall sanctify Him."" And our Rabbis, of blessed memory,
explained that it refers to all matters of sanctity; that in all matters of
importance he should be sanctified. He is to be called first to the Torah
reading, and to be the first speaker at all public gatherings, and to speak
first and expound on the Torah. He should also speak first in the
yeshivah. Also at a meal, he is first to say the Berachah of Hamotzi and
to lead the Birkas Hamazon. He should be given the choice portion
before the others who are dining, unless an Israelite is present who is
greater than him in Torah [learning], in which case you should give the
scholar the choice portion. But when a kohein divides a partnership
with his friend, an Israelite, the Israelite need not give him the better
share, for it is not honorable for the kohein to take the better share, for
one who covets the better share will never see a sign of blessing. When a
kohein is not present it is best to give preference to a Levi before an
Israelite in all things mentioned here, if they are equal in Torah
scholarship.

9

It is forbidden to make servile use of a kohein. This applies even in our
time, and it is like taking unwarranted benefit of a sacred object. As it is
said, ""You shall sanctify him for he offers the bread of your God."" And
even now though we have no sacrifices, he retains his sanctity. If the
kohein wants to forego the honors due him, he may do so for the
kehunah is his possession and he may forego its honors, and permit an





Israelite to use him as a servant. And certainly he may give the Israelite
the honor of preceding him in the aforementioned matters.
"
"1

Every man is obligated to get married in order to fulfill the mitzvah of
propagation. This mitzvah is incumbent on a man from the beginning
of his eighteenth year. At any rate, you should not pass your twentieth
year without getting married. Only if you are diligently studying Torah
and are afraid to marry in order not to be disrupted from learning
Torah, are you permitted to delay marrying; and this is so, provided
you are not overwhelmed with lustful desire.

2

When you have begotten a son and a daughter, you have fulfilled the
mitzvah of propagation, provided the son is not impotent or the
daughter sterile. If you had a son and a daughter who died, and they
left surviving children, you have fulfilled the mitzvah of propagation.
This is true only when the surviving grandchildren are a son and a
daughter and were begotten from your son and your daughter, so that
even if your son begot only a daughter, and your daughter begot only a
son, since they come from your son and daughter, you have fulfilled the
mitzvah of propagation. But if one of your children left no surviving
children even though your other child left many surviving sons and
daughters, you [the grandfather] have not fulfilled the mitzvah of
propagation.

3

Even though you have fulfilled the mitzvah of propagation, you are
forbidden to remain without a wife. You should marry a woman





capable of bearing children if it is possible. But if you are aware that
you are unable to have children, it is preferable that you marry a
woman that is not able to bear children. Similarly, if you have many
children, and you fear if you marry a woman capable of bearing
children there will be bickering and quarrels between your children and
your wife, you are permitted to marry a woman who is not capable of
bearing children, but it is forbidden to remain unmarried because of
this concern.
4

If a man takes a wife and she was with him ten years without bearing
children, he should divorce her. Concerning this practice, there are
many halachic details.

5

A woman is not commanded to fulfill the mitzvah of propagation.
Nevertheless, she should not remain unmarried so as not to be subject
to suspicion.

6

Every man should try to marry a worthy woman from a respectable
family. The Jewish people have three traits: they are modest,
compassionate, and benevolent. A person lacking these traits is not a
commendable partner for marriage.

7

If a woman is suitable, even if you marry her because of her wealth, it is
permitted, but only when the money is given willingly. But if you defer
marriage and wait until you find a woman with the money you desire;
or if you agreed to a marriage and was promised a great deal of money,
and the promise was retracted, and you abandon your bride because of
this, or you quarrel over this, you are referred to as ""One who marries
for money."" You will have unworthy children, and will not be





successful. Such a marriage will not be a happy one, for money that a
man takes for marrying his wife is money not properly earned. But,
rather, whatever is given to you by your father-in-law or mother-in-law
you should accept graciously, and then you will be successful.
8

A man ignorant in Torah knowledge should not marry the daughter of
a kohein for such a marriage will not be a happy one. A scrupulous
person should be particular not to marry a woman who has the same
name as his mother.

9

It is a mitzvah to marry your sister's daughter or your brother's
daughter. You should not marry any other relative, whether she is
related to you or to your deceased or divorced wife, or she is related to
the woman to whom you have given chalitzah, without consulting an
halachic authority

10

You should be ever careful to honor your wife, for blessing is not found
in a person's home but for the wife's sake. And so the Sages said to the
men of their time, ""Honor your wives so that you may be blessed with
wealth.""

11

You may not dwell with your wife even for a short time without a
kesubah. If the kesubah is lost you must be very concerned and go
immediately to the Beis Din to write another kesubah for her.

12

A kohein is forbidden to marry a divorcée, a harlot, a chalalah or one to
whom chalitzah was given. A woman is considered a harlot in this
instance even if she was forced to have illicit intercourse and is
forbidden to a kohein. A chalalah is a woman born to a kohein who
married a woman forbidden to him.




13


Any woman who was widowed or divorced must wait ninety days
excluding the day of her divorce or her husband's death and excluding
her wedding day before marrying another man. This is the halachah
even if she is a woman incapable of bearing a child. Even if her first
husband was overseas; or incarcerated in prison, it makes no difference.
Even if she miscarried in the interim, it is to no avail. She is forbidden
even to get engaged [during this waiting period,] unless her intended
husband vows not to enter her house during this waiting period. But
one who remarries his divorcee need not wait.

14

If the aforementioned woman is pregnant or is nursing an infant, she
may not marry another man until the child is twenty four months old.
Even if she gave birth after she was divorced or widowed and has not
yet begun to nurse, she must wait. If a very important matter is
involved, they should consult an halachic authority.

15

A woman whose two husbands died, should not marry a third one
without consulting an halachic authority.

16

If a woman heard that her husband died in some other place, even if
she heard this from many trustworthy men, she should not remarry
without consulting an halachic authority.

17

If a man is suspected of committing adultery with a married woman,
and her husband divorced her or died, she is forbidden to [marry] that
suspected man, for just as she became forbidden to her husband, so too
she is forbidden to the one who committed adultery with her. Even if
her husband divorced her only because of improper conduct that was





rumored about her regarding that suspected man, the suspect is
forbidden to marry her.
18

One who is suspected of having intercourse with a non-Jewess, who
subsequently converted to Judaism, is forbidden to marry her.

19

A non-Jew who had intercourse with a Jewess, and subsequently
converted to Judaism, is forbidden to marry her.

20

If one divorces his wife so that she can marry a particular man, even
though he did not expressly make this conditional but it is evident that
this is the objective of the divorce, it is forbidden for that individual to
marry her.

21

Those women whom the Sages, of blessed memory, have forbidden one
to marry, may not dwell even in the closed alley in which he dwells.

22

If a man heard that his wife committed adultery, even though he is not
certain about it, he must consult an halachic authority if he is permitted
to live with her.

23

It is not befitting for a respectable man to marry a woman who was
divorced because of immodesty.

24

If a woman has bad character traits such as a quarrelsome disposition,
or she is not modest as are respectable Jewish women, it is a mitzvah to
divorce her, even if it is the first marriage.

25

The Sages have ordained that a man should marry off his sons and
daughters when they reach maturity, for if he neglects to do so they





may be tempted into prostitution, or to have lewd thoughts.
Concerning this it says, ""And you shall visit your habitation and you
will not sin."" Also the Sages commanded the Bnei Yisrael, that whoever
sees that his wife is not conducting herself properly, and is somewhat
intimate with other men, he should admonish her and caution her,
privately, gently, and in a pure way, to prevent her from stumbling, and
to influence her to conduct herself properly. But he should not say to
her expressly, ""Do not meet in private with so and so."" (You should not
say this) even privately, (since presently we do not have Mei sotah this
can lead to serious problems). If you are not strict with your wife and
your children, and all the members of your household to caution them
and to constantly supervise their conduct until you are confident they
are perfectly free of sin and iniquity, you are considered a sinner. For it
is said, ""And you shall know that peace is in your tent and you shall
visit your habitation and not sin.""
26

It is forbidden to perform the marriage ceremonies of two brothers or
of two sisters in the same day, because you may not join one festive
event with another. Some [authorities] say that you may not perform
both ceremonies even in the same week, and they bring proof [of this
from the marriage] of our father, Yaakov. For it is written, ""Fulfill the
week of this one.""
"
"1

It is customary that the bridegroom and the bride fast on their wedding
day because on that day their sins are forgiven. They should say Aneinu
at Minchah as on other fast days. In our area it is customary that they
fast only until after the marriage ceremony. If the ceremony is delayed





till the night, then, after the stars appear, they may eat something,
provided they do not drink any intoxicating beverages.
2

On Rosh Chodesh, on the day after Shavuos, on the fifteenth day of the
month of Av, on the fifteenth day of the month of Shevat, and also on
Chanukah and on Shushan Purim, they do not fast. But in the month of
Nissan, even on Rosh Chodesh (Nissan) they do fast. And so too on the
thirty-third day of the Omer, and on the days between Rosh Chodesh
Sivan and Shavuos, and on the days between Yom Kippur and Sukkos,
they fast.

3

On the days they do not fast, they must be careful not to indulge in
excessive food and drink; and certainly they must be very careful to
abstain from intoxicating beverages. (For some authorities say the very
reason for the fast is because we are concerned they may become
intoxicated and their minds would not be lucid).

4

The bridegroom and the bride must conduct themselves with utmost
sanctity when they enter the chupah, and they should repent on that
day. They should search [review] their deeds from the day of their birth
until this day, and they should confess [their sins,] and seek forgiveness,
pardon, and atonement from Hashem, Blessed is He. They should
confess and forsake (their evil ways). Their absolute remorse should
emanate from a contrite heart. They should firmly resolve from this day
onward to serve Hashem honestly and sincerely, and to be holy and
pure. They should then enter the chupah and pray that the Holy one,
Blessed is He, rest His Divine Presence between them, as our Sages of
blessed memory said, ""A husband and wife, (if deserving), the Divine





Presence is between them."" It is customary for them to say the
confession at the Minchah prayer as is done the day before Yom Kippur.
"
"1

It is customary to have the chupah under the open sky as a good omen
(as it is written), ""So will your children be, like the stars of the
heavens."" Similarly it is customary to marry only in the phase of the full
moon as a good omen.

2

It is proper not to marry until the bride purifies herself. It is now the
custom not to be exacting about this. However, it is best to inform the
bridegroom before the chupah, that she is a niddah.

3

It is the custom in our areas that at the marriage of a virgin, the
distinguished persons of the community spread a veil over the bride's
head, and bless her, saying, ""Our sister, be the mother of thousands and
myriads."" We refer to the chupah as the next sequence when a cloth is
spread upon poles, under which the groom and bride enter in public,
and where he consecrates her to himself. This is where the berachos of
betrothal and marriage are recited. However, the most essential part of
the chupah is the intimate privacy, which will be explained, God
willing, in the following chapter.

4

The groomsmen [or the father] enrobe the bridegroom with a kittle, so
that he is reminded of the day of death, and be inspired to repent. It is
also customary to place ashes on the groom's head on the place where
the tefillin shel rosh is worn. It is also customary that the parents and





prominent relatives bless the groom and the bride and pray that their
union be successful.
5

Thereafter the groom is led under the chupah (canopy) (for we spread a
cloth upon poles which is what we refer to as chupah), and we place
him [under the chupah] facing East, while the chazan chants whatever
chant is customary in that community. Then the bridesmaids lead the
bride (to the chupah). The groomsmen and prominent men walk
toward the bride, and as they approach her, they turn around and
proceed to the chupah. Then the bridesmaids bring the bride [under the
chupah], and together with her, walk around the groom seven times.
The chazan again chants in accordance with the custom. After that,
they place the bride to the right of the groom, and the one who recites
the berachos stands to the side and faces the East.
"
"1

The most essential part of the chupah is bringing the groom and the
bride to a designated private room, where they eat together in privacy
following the kidushin. You must prevent anybody from entering that
room so that there may be absolute privacy. This is the real chupah that
consummates and completes the marriage.

2

In the case of a virgin, this yichud (privacy) consummates the marriage
even if it is not fit for cohabitation, if for example, she is a niddah, or if
people are going in and out of the room. (When she is a niddah it is
mandatory that people should be going in and out of the room for if
not, they are forbidden to have privacy prior to their first cohabitation.)




3


In the case of a widow the marriage is consummated only when their
privacy is appropriate for cohabitation, which means she must be
menstrually clean, and no one is able to enter the room.

4

An acquisition may not be made on Shabbos, and therefore if the
wedding took place on Friday, great care must be taken that the yichud
consummating the marriage be made before Shabbos sets in. And then,
when the yichud consummating the marriage was made while it was yet
day, he is permitted to have the initial marital relations on Shabbos,
regardless if she is a virgin or a widow. But if the yichud was not made
while it was yet day (before Shabbos), then he is forbidden to approach
her on Shabbos, for their initial marital relations. This is because
cohabitation completes the acquisition, and it is forbidden to make an
acquisition on Shabbos.
"
"1

Before saying Birkas Hamazon, in the company of ten adult males, the
leader says Dvai Hoser etc. (banish sorrow etc.), and Shehasimcha
bimono (In Whose abode is joy). Sheachalnu mishelo (We have eaten of
His bounty) is said without the letter vav as a conjunction, and not
vesheachalnu mishelo. After concluding the Birkas Hamazon the leader
takes a second cup (of wine) over which he recites six berachos. After
this, he says over the (first cup), which is the cup of Birkas Hamazon,
the berachah Borei peri Hagaffen (Creator of the fruit of the vine). It is
best not to fill the cup for the six berachos until the conclusion of Birkas
Hamazon. Care should be taken that men and women should not eat
[together] in one room, for if men and women eat [together] in one





room Shehasimcha Bimono cannot be said, because there is no joy [in
the Heavens] where the evil inclination reigns.
2

If a young man [one who was never married] married a virgin or a
widow, or if a widower married a virgin, the above mentioned berachos
are said after the first meal following the wedding, even if they did not
eat it on that day, but only at night following the day of the wedding,
or even on the following day (because the first meal is considered as if
new guests are participating). But after this first meal, and during the
entire seven days of the wedding week, only if new guests come to
participate is Birkas Hamazon recited in this manner.

3

When a new guest does not come to participate, and the men dining
with the groom are not members of his family, but come to celebrate as
friends, Dvai Hoser is not said, but nodeh leshimecha is said as well as
shehasimcha bimono. After concluding Birkas Hamazon, the leader takes
a second cup, and recites the berachah asher bara sassone vesimcha etc.
After that he again takes the cup that was used for Birkas Hamazon, and
recites over it Borei peri Haggafen. For this ten men are not necessary,
and even the presence of three is sufficient for saying Birkas Hamazon
in this manner. However, if the groom eats only with family members,
these things are not said.

4

When a widower marries a widow, if they ate the first meal on the day
of the wedding, even if the meal lasted into the night, Birkas Hamazon
is recited as stated in paragraph 1. But if they did not begin the meal
until nightfall, if there are men dining [with them] to celebrate as
friends, Birkas Hamazon should be recited as stated in paragraph 3.





(This is true even if there is a new guest participating.) This applies to
all the meals during the first three days (after the wedding).
5

The term ""new guest"" applies to a person who has come to celebrate as
a friend, and for whom they want to prepare extra food even though he
does not eat (with them). Shabbos, the first day Yom Tov and the
second day Yom Tov are considered as new guests. But this applies only
to the meal at night and the meal in the morning, but the third meal is
not considered as a new guest unless the groom expounds on a Torah
topic.

6

If one invites the groom and the bride to dine with him, and he assigns
a private room for them where they can be alone and rejice together, it
is considered as [a part of ] their wedding and the seven berachos are
recited. But if this is not the case, even the beracha asher bara is not
recited, (nor do we say) shehasimcha bimono.

7

When the wedding guests break up into many groups [to feast], even in
houses that do not face the place of the groom. Nevertheless, each
group recites these (seven) berachos, since they are eating from the feast
that was prepared for the wedding. However, the waiters, who eat after
the wedding feast is over, do not recite these berachos.

8

When one remarries his divorced wife, shehasimcha bimono is omitted.
At the first meal on the wedding day the seven berachos are recited. But
from then on none of the berachos are said.

9

It is a mitzvah to rejoice the groom and bride, and to dance before her
and say that she is beautiful and gracious, (from the expression, ""She





found grace and favour before him""); and we find that Rabbi Yehuda
Bar Illai used to dance before the bride.
10

It is forbidden to stare at the bride, but you are allowed to look at her
jewelry, and at her uncovered hair.

Some people have a custom that if the bride was menstrually unclean at
the time of the wedding, then afterwards, on the night of her ritual
immersion, they make a feast and invite guests. This is improper, and
this custom should be abolished because it is a breach of modesty. But
if they make a small feast for the household and they say shehasimcha
bimono, one need not protest. But the seven berachos must not be said,
other than in the manner described above.

12

One who marries a virgin must rejoice with her for seven days, which
are called ""The seven days of feasting."" (During this time) he should
not do work, and should not do business in the marketplace; but
should eat and drink and rejoice with her regardless if he was a bachelor
or a widower. Even if she waives this right he is still forbidden to do
work. He is forbidden to go alone in the street. If one marries a
previously married woman, if he is a widower, all authorities agree he
need not rejoice more than three days. If he was never married, some
authorities rule that he must rejoice with her seven days since because
of him they recite the seven berachas. Nevertheless, in this case the
woman may waive her right to be rejoiced. If a public fast occurs
during ""The seven days of feasting"" see chapter 121:7 and chapter
141:2.




13


One who takes a wife to himself must remain in his city a full year to
rejoice with her; as it is said, ""He shall not go out with the army; he
shall be free for his home one year, and he shall cheer his wife."" But the
woman can waive this right.
"
"1

It is fitting that man conduct himself with great holiness, pure
thoughts, and a correct attitude when having marital relationship. He
should not indulge in frivolity with his wife, nor defile his mouth with
indecent jests, even in private conversation with her, for the Scriptures
say, ""And declare to man what is his conversation."" And our Rabbis, of
blessed memory, said, ""Even the light conversation between a man and
his wife are recalled to him on the day of Judgement."" He should not
converse with her during the marital act, nor immediately before it,
except what is necessary for marital relations. When she is angry and he
is forbidden to have marital relations with her, he may speak kind
words to her to appease her. The marital act should be in the most
possible modest manner. He underneath and she above him, is
considered an impudent manner. Both at the same level, is an act of
perversion. It is said of Rabbi Eliezer, that the marital act was done with
such awe and terror, that it appeared as if a demon was forcing him to
do it.

2

While engaged in the marital act, you should think about Torah
subjects or other sacred subjects. Even though [during the act itself ] it
is forbidden to speak words of Torah, thinking about them is permitted
and meritorious, for thought is not likened to speech in this case. Even





though in filthy alleys it is forbidden to even think about sacred
subjects, this is because of the Divine command, ""And your camp shall
be holy;"" but where it is forbidden because of body nakedness,
concerning which it is written, ervas davar (unseemingly thing), our
Sages of blessed memory inferred from this that speaking davar (words
of Torah) is forbidden, but thinking about them is permitted.
3

The marital act is forbidden in a lighted room, even if the light is
dimmed with a garment. But if you make a partition ten tefachim high
in front of the light, it is permissible. Marital relations are also
forbidden by day unless the room is darkened. At night, if the moon is
shining directly on you it is forbidden. However if it is not shining
[directly] on you, even though it is shining into the room, you may
shut out its light with a garment [or window shade], and it is then
permitted. Also, if there is a light in another room and it shines into
this room, you must shut out this light with a garment.

4

Marital relations are forbidden in the presence of any person who is
awake, even with a partition of ten tefachim. In the presence of a child
who is unable to speak, it is permitted.

5

It is forbidden to look at the genitals of your wife. Anyone who does
look there, is devoid of shame. He violates [the Scriptural verse], ""And
walk humbly (or modestly) before Adonoy,"" and removes the sign of
shame from his face. A bashful person is not apt to sin, as it is written,
""So that His fear be on your face,"" which refers to bashfulness, ""So that
you do not sin."" Also, (by looking there); you stimulate evil desire
within yourself. Certainly one who kisses that place violates all these





admonitions, and in addition he violates [the Scriptural verse,] ""Do not
make yourselves repulsive.""
6

In a room in which there is a seifer Torah, marital relations are
forbidden until it is removed to another room. If there is no other room
you must make a partition in front of it that is ten tefachim high. The
partition should be totally closed up, so that the seifer Torah cannot be
seen. The curtain around the bed is not considered a partition since it is
movable; unless it is tied at the bottom. Tefillin, Chumashim, or other
sacred writings, such as the Talmud, Midrash and their commentaries,
whether they are written or printed should be placed into a vessel
within a vessel. This is valid only when the second vessel [or covering] is
not especially made for such holy works, but if they are especially made
for them, even ten such vessels are all considered as only one vessel. If
you spread a cover over the chest containing these books, it is
considered like a vessel within a vessel. Also a mezuzah, when affixed on
the inside of the room, must be covered it with two covers, so it should
be a vessel within a vessel. The Name (Shaddai, on the outer face of the
mezuzah) must also be covered. A glass covering is of no avail for the
covering must not be transparent.

7

You must not be excessive in marital relations with your wife, except at
the time you are required to fulfil her conjugal rights, as it is written,
""And he shall not diminish her conjugal rights."" Men who are healthy,
who enjoy the pleasures of life, who have profitable businesses in their
home town, and are not burdened with taxes, should perform their
marital duty nightly. Laborers who work in the city in which they
reside, should perform their marital duty twice a week. If they are
employed in another city, their marital duty is once a week. Also the





merchants who travel to the villages with their mules to buy grain to be
sold in town, and those who have similar pursuits, their marital duty is
once a week. Men who carry freight on camels to distant places, their
marital duty is once in thirty days. The marital duty of Torah scholars is
from Shabbos eve to Shabbos eve. You must perform your marital duty
even when your wife is pregnant or nursing. You may not deprive her of
her conjugal rights unless she consents to it willingly, and only after you
have already fulfilled the Divine commandment of propogation. If you
deprive her conjugal rights in order to afflict her, you violate a negative
command, as it is said, ""And he shall not diminish her conjugal rights.""
8

Every husband is required to be with his wife on the night of her ritual
immersion, and on the night before he sets out on a journey, unless he
is going to perform a mitzvah. When a husband sees that his wife is
enticing him, trying to please him, and beautifying herself in front of
him, in order to attract his intention, he is obligated to be with her
even if it is not the appointed time; and from such a union will come
worthy children. However, if she demands it openly, she is a brazen
woman, and she is considered like a harlot; and he is forbidden to keep
her for a wife.

9

When engaging in marital relations, your intention should not be to
satisfy your personal pleasure but as one fulfilling his obligation to
satisfy her conjugal rights; and also to fulfill the command of your
Creator, (and) to have children who engage in Torah study, and fulfill
the mitzvos of the Jewish people. It is also proper if your intent is to
improve the fetus; as our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said, ""During the
first trimester of pregnancy cohabitation is difficult for the woman and
the child. During the middle trimester, it is difficult for the woman but





good for the child. During the last trimester, it is good both for the
woman and the child, for it will cause the child at his birth to be strong
and healthy."" This too is a proper intention. If your purpose of being
with her is to restrain yourself against sinful lust, when you are
overwhelmed by desire, and have a craving for it—if this is your
intention, you will also be rewarded. However, it is better that you push
off your desire and overcome it; for (as the Sages said), ""A man has a
small organ, if he starves it, it is contented, and if he pampers it, it is
hungry."" But one who has no need for it, but deliberately arouses his
desire in order to satisfy that desire, is following the counsel of the evil
impulse.
10

If possible you should be careful not to have marital relations in the
beginning or at the end of the night, but rather in the middle of the
night. [If you were asleep before this] you may not touch the penile
orifice even for the sake of cohabitation, before washing your hands
properly, that is, three times alternately, as stated in Chapter 2.

11

Marital relations are forbidden in the market places, in streets, in
gardens, or in orchards. It is permitted only in dwellings so that it does
not resemble prostitution.

12

If, God forbid, there is [such] famine in the land that the price of grain
[food] doubled, even though you have sufficient grain [food] in your
house, or if, God forbid, there is some other calamity [in the country],
marital relations are forbidden except on the night of her ritual
immersion. Those who are childless are permitted to have marital
relations on each appointed time of marital duty.




13


You should not have marital relations with your wife unless she is
willing. But if she is not willing you should not have marital relations
with her, and it is certainly forbidden to force her. Also, you should not
have marital relations with her if you hate her, or if she hates you and
tells you she does not want you, although she consents to marital
relations. Also, if you have decided to divorce her, and she is unaware of
it; even though you do not hate her, you are forbidden to have marital
relations with her. You should also not have marital relations with your
wife when she is actually asleep. You also may not have marital relations
when either of you are intoxicated.

14

House guests are forbidden to have marital relations. But if you and
your wife were given private quarters, it is permitted, provided you do
not sleep on sheets that belong to the host.

15

According to the rules of good health, you should not have marital
relations when you are satiated, and not when you are hungry, but only
when your food has been digested. You should not have marital
relations while standing, and not in a sitting position, not on a day you
had a bath, and not on a day you let blood; not on the day you set out
on a journey, or return from a journey by foot; and not on the day
before nor on the day following any of the above.

16

You should not have marital relations on a bed where an infant lies at
your feet if the baby is less than one year old. After leaving the
bathroom, you should wait an hour before having marital relations. A
nursing woman should not indulge in marital relations unless the baby





is asleep. After marital relations she should not nurse him before two
thirds of an hour transpires, unless the baby is crying.
17

Semen is the vitality of man's body and the light of his eyes, and when
issued in excess, the body weakens and life is shortened. Anyone who
overindulges in marital relations, ages prematurely, his strength ebbs,
his eyes dim, his breath becomes foul; the hair on his head, his
eyebrows, and his eye lashes fall out. The hair of his beard and armpits,
the hair on his legs, increase, his teeth fall out and many other aches
besides these befall him. Great physicians said one out of a thousand
dies from other diseases, the rest of the thousand (999) die from sexual
indulgence. Therefore, man should avoid such indulgence.
"
"1

It is forbidden to discharge semen in vain. This is a graver sin than any
other in the Torah. Those who masturbate and thus discharge semen in
vain, not only do they commit a grave sin, but also one who does this is
placed under a ban. Concerning such people it is said, ""Your hands are
full of blood,"" and it is likened to killing a person. See what Rashi wrote
in the Sidrah of Vayeishev concerning Er and Onan, who died because
of committing this sin. Occasionally, as a punishment for this sin, God
forbid, one's children die when young, or grow up to be wicked, while
the sinner is reduced to poverty.

2

It is forbidden to bring on an erection (in vain), or to cause yourself to
think about women. If a [lewd] thought comes spontaneously, you
should divert your attention from nonsense to words of Torah, which is
likened to, ""A lovely hind and a graceful doe."" Lewd thoughts prevail





only in a heart devoid of (Torah) wisdom. You should be extremely
careful to avoid an erection. Therefore, it is forbidden to sleep on your
back facing upward, or to sleep (on your stomach) facing downward,
but you should sleep on your side to avoid an erection. Two bachelors
should not sleep in one bed. You should not watch animals, beasts, or
fowl when the male and female copulate. It is forbidden to ride on an
animal without a saddle.
3

When urinating, it is forbidden to hold the penis even to facilitate
urination. If you are married and your wife is also with you in town,
and she is clean (menstrually), from the halachic standpoint it is
permitted; for when a person has the possibility, he will usually not
succumb to lustful thoughts and stimulation. But it is a matter of piety
to be stringent even in this situation. When not for the purpose of
urinating, even halachically the above mentioned things are forbidden.

4

At supper you should not eat or drink excessively nor eat any foods that
tend to heat the body, such as fat meats, all milk products, cheese, eggs,
and garlic. Neither should you drink a beverage that tends to heat the
body, for these things cause the committing of this sin.

5

If, God forbid, you had a seminal emission at night, upon waking up
from your sleep you should wash your hands and say with a contrite
heart, ""Master of the Universe I have done this unwittingly but it was
due to sinful thoughts and sinful reflections; therefore, may it be Your
will Adonoy, my God, and the God of my fathers, to erase this iniquity
through your great mercy, and save me from sinful thoughts, and from
similar occurrences forever and ever. Amein, so may it be Your will.""




6


If you wish to avoid this sin, guard your mouth against obscene
language, lies, talebearing, slander, and mockery. You should also guard
your ears from hearing such talk. You must also be careful to fulfill your
vows, not to worry too much about things, and be careful to guard
yourself against lewd thoughts. Before going to sleep you should study
Torah or say the first four Chapters of the Psalms, and be careful not to
sleep alone in a room.

7

Means of amendment for a person who has succumbed to this sin, are
recorded in the book, Yesod Yosef, which the author culled and gathered
from holy and ancient books. Here I will cite some of them briefly: He
should try to be sandeik, that is, to have babies circumcised on his knees
(lap), and in particular to be a sandeik for poor families. He should
increase his charity to the poor, observe Shabbos properly and honor it
delightfully, and light many Shabbos candles. He should honor and
love those who learn Torah. He should pray with fervor and tears. He
should adopt the character of humility, and if he hears people insult
him, he should be quiet and forgiving. When performing a mitzvah, he
should do it energetically and with quickness until it warms him,
particularly when preparing the matzos for Pesach. He should raise his
children to study Torah, and train them to be God-fearing. He should
raise an orphan in his home, and should treat him as he treats his own
son. He should engage in the mitzvah of dowering poor brides. He
should be called up to the reading of the Torah at least once a month,
and recite the berachos aloud. He should look in the Torah, and read
quietly along with the reader. He should try to be among the first ten to
come to the Synagogue. He should arise in the middle of the night to
recite tikun chatzos with tears. And if it is impossible for him to get up





in the middle of the night, he should recite tikun chatzos later in the
night. He should love peace and should pursue peace.
"
"1

It is forbidden to be secluded with any woman whether young or old, a
Jewess or a non-Jewess, whether she is a relative or not a relative, with
the exception of a father who may be alone with his daughter; and a
mother with her son, and a husband with his wife, even though she is
menstrually unclean. (Concerning a bride who is menstrually unclean
see Chapter 157, below).

2

If your wife is [also] present, you are permitted to be alone even with
another woman because your wife is a chaperon. But a Jewess may not
be alone with a non-Jew, even in the presence of his wife. Even if there
are many non-Jews accompanied by their wives, she may not be alone
with them.

3

One woman may be alone with two virtuous men, but only in town,
and in the daytime. But in a field, or at night even in the city, there
must be [at least] three virtuous men present. With immoral men, she
should never be alone, even if they are many, unless their wives are with
them. One man is forbidden to be secluded with two women. Some
authorities permit seclusion with three or more women, provided his
vocation or trade is not specifically for women. Other authorities forbid
it in any event.

4

If a woman's husband is in town, you need not be concerned about
being secluded with her, because she is in fear of her husband.




5


In a room where the door is open to a public thoroughfare, there is no
prohibition of yichud during the daytime and in the early evening, so
long as people are passing by on the street. But if he is an intimate
friend of hers, like one with whom she grew up, or if she is related to
him, or if her husband warned her not to be alone with him, she may
not be alone with him, even if her husband is in town, and not even in
a room whose door is opened to a public thoroughfare.

6

If a girl is less than three years old, it is permitted to be secluded with
her. Likewise, if a boy is less than nine years old a woman is permitted
to be alone with him.

7

A man who does not have a wife should not teach children, because
their mothers come to the school and at times he will be alone with a
woman. [If he is married], it is not necessary that his wife be with him
at the school, so long as she is in town; even if she is at home, and he
teaches at the school. But a woman should not teach children even if
her husband is in town, unless her husband lives with her in the house
(where she teaches), because the fathers bring their children to school.

8

A man must diligently avoid women. It is forbidden to make gestures
with your hands or with your feet, nor wink your eyes at a woman. It is
forbidden to jest with her, to act with levity in her presence, or to gaze
at her beauty. It is forbidden to smell perfumes designed specifically for
a woman; especially when she is holding them in her hands, or when
they are on her. It is forbidden to look at the colored garments of a
woman with whom you are acquainted, although the garments are not
upon her lest you come to think about her. If you encounter a woman





on the street, it is forbidden to walk behind her, but you should hasten
your steps so that she is alongside you or behind you. You should not
pass by the door of a harlot, even at a distance of four cubits. He who
gazes, even at the small finger of a woman in order to enjoy its sight,
commits a very grave sin. It is forbidden to listen to the voice [of a
woman] singing or to gaze at a woman's hair.
9

You must refrain from showing interest in women. It is forbidden to
send her regards even through her husband. Therefore, when writing a
letter to your friend, it is forbidden to write, ""Send regards to your
wife."" But it is permitted to inquire of her husband or of someone else
about her welfare. It is also permitted to write to your friend, ""Let me
know how your wife is doing.""

10

If you hug or kiss even one of your female relatives, even though you
derive no pleasure from it, you are violating a prohibition, for you may
not have any physical closeness with a near relative, with the exception
of a father with his daughter, and a mother with her son, who are
permitted to hug and kiss.

11

You must not engage in any intimate activities, even with your wife in
the presence of others, so that on-lookers will not be led to sinful
thoughts.

12

A man must not dwell in his father-in-law's house, unless he has a
private bedroom.

13

The great men of Yisrael, of blessed memory, in their holy works,
admonished against the evil custom prevailing in some communities,
where there are no Torah scholars or God-fearing men, that the groom





and bride become intimate with hugs and kisses; and they also allow
dances, in which boys and girls dance together. All virgins are assumed
to be menstrually unclean, and since the prohibition of niddah applies
to married and single woman alike, whoever touches a woman in an
intimate manner deserves punishment by lashing. Besides the grave sin
of touching a niddah, he also stirs the evil impulse within himself, and
causes himself to have an erection, and to discharge semen in vain, God
forbid. Certainly anyone who is able to effectively protest [against this
custom] must make every endeavor to protest. At least, it is the duty of
every man who has the fear of God in his heart, to control his
household, and to supervise the members of his family, so that they will
keep themselves distant from this extremely abominable behavior.
Anyone who is able to effectively protest and does not protest, God
forbid, he too will be accountable for this very iniquity. Anyone who
saves others from sin has saved himself (too), and it shall be well with
him.
14

With regard to the woman whom you wish to marry, it is permissible
and even desirable for you to look at her to see if she pleases you, but
you may not gaze upon her in a lustful manner. Concerning this it is
said, ""I made a covenant with my eyes, how then can I ever gaze at a
maiden.""

15

If you divorced the wife you married, she may not reside in the same
courtyard as you do. If you are a kohein, or even a Yisroeil, but she has
since married another man, and was divorced from him too; or if you
divorced her because she was forbidden to you; all of these require a
greater measure of separation. And subsequently, she may not reside
with you in the same alley if it comes to a dead-end. But if it is an open





alley, through which there is traffic, they are permitted to live there. A
divorced woman who remarried and lives with her second husband,
they [she and her first husband] require an even greater measure of
separation, and she may not dwell with her first husband in the same
neighborhood. In all these cases of separation, the woman must move
away from him. But if the courtyard belongs to her, he must move away
from her.
16

A man is permitted to support his divorcee, and it is [even] a mitzvah
to do so more than to another poor person, for it is said, ""Do not hide
from your own flesh."" But he may have no personal contact with her,
and should send her support through an agent.

17

Said Rav Beruna in the name of Rav, ""He who sleeps in a room in
which a husband and wife reside, the Scripture says concerning him,
""The women of My people you cast out of their pleasant houses"", (for
they are ashamed to be intimate because of him). Rav Yosef said this
applies even if his wife is menstrually unclean.
"
"1

A woman from whose womb there issued a drop of blood, be it ever so
small, regardless of the circumstances, whether it is in her nature, as
some women, to have a regular period or an irregular period; even if she
experienced some sort of accident which caused blood to issue from her
womb, she is a niddah (menstrually unclean), until she counts seven
clean days, and properly performs the ritual immersion. Anyone who
cohabitates with her when she is menstrually unclean, receives the





punishment of koras. She too receives the punishment, koras. For
touching in an intimate manner, their punishment is flagellation.
2

Even if she did not feel the issue of blood from her womb, but found a
stain of blood on her body, or garment, or sheet, or any other place,
and she is unable to attribute its presence to any source other than from
her womb, she is unclean. A woman who finds a stain that is not
actually red, but is not actually white either, must consult a competent
Rav, for concerning this there are many divergent laws regarding the
size of the stain. There are also many laws regarding to what it can be
attributed and to what it cannot be attributed. There is also a
distinction as to the time she found it, whether it was on her
menstrually clean days or on the first days of her seven clean days.

3

If a woman senses that her womb has opened [i.e. she senses the
beginning of mensruation], even if she examined herself immediately
and found nothing, she is menstrually unclean. (It is necessary to let
women know this, for many women do not know it.) But if she found
a white secretion from her body without any reddish admixture, she is
clean.

4

It is written, ""And to a woman who is menstrually unclean, you shall
not approach."" Since it is written ""You shall not approach,"" it is
explained, that any kind of approach is forbidden. You should not jest
(with her), and should not indulge in levity with her, or even speak
words that may lead to sin. However, you may be secluded with her, for
since you have had marital relations with her, and she will be permitted
to you after immersion, your impulse will not be that strong, and we





are not concerned that you might cohabit with her when it is
forbidden.
5

You may not touch your wife (during that period) even on the small
finger, and you may not hand her anything, not even a long object, nor
may you receive anything from her hand. Also, throwing anything from
your hand into her hand or from her hand to yours is forbidden.

6

You may not eat with her at the table unless you make a noticeable
change; for example, separating your plate from her plate, with
something you do not usually place there at other times, or she should
change her place. If you are accustomed, when she is menstrually clean,
to eat together from one plate, and now when she is unclean you eat
from separate plates, this change is sufficient.

7

You are not allowed to drink what she leaves over in her cup. But if
someone else drank from the cup after her, or it has been poured into
another cup you are permitted to drink it. If she drank from it and you
are unaware of it, and you want to drink from that cup, she need not
tell you that she drank from it. (But if you know she drank from it but
do not know that she is a niddah, it would seem that she has to inform
you). She is permitted to drink the leftovers from your cup. Some
authorities maintain that just as you are forbidden to drink the leftovers
from her cup so too you are forbidden to eat from her leftover food.

8

You may not sleep together in the same bed, even if the bed is not
exclusively hers, and even if you are both fully clothed and do not
touch one another, and even if each of you have a separate mattress.
And even to lie on two separate beds, if the beds touch one another it is





forbidden. If you both lie on the ground, you should not lie facing one
another unless there is a sizable distance between you and her. The
same applies if you sleep in two separate beds placed parallel to one
another, whereby sometimes you face one another. Even though there is
space between the beds, it is forbidden unless there is a sizable space
between the beds. The husband is forbidden even to sit on the bed
reserved for her, even when she is not present. She is forbidden to sleep
on the bed reserved for her husband. But so far as her sitting on it, you
need not be stringent.
9

It is forbidden to sit together on a long bench, if it sways. If someone
else sits between you, it is permitted. You may not ride together in the
same wagon or on the same boat, if it is just a pleasure trip, like riding
through parks, orchards or similar excursions. But if you are travelling
from city to city on business, it is permitted, even though you are by
yourselves; provided you are seated in a way that you will not touch one
another.

10

You must not look at any part of her body that she usually keeps
covered. But on those parts that are usually not covered, you are
permitted to look even if you derive pleasure from it. You are forbidden
to scent her personal perfume, and you are forbidden to hear her sing.

11

It is proper that she wear special clothes on the days of her impurity, so
that they will both always remember that she is menstrually unclean.
With great halachic difficulty, the Sages permitted her to use cosmetics
(rouge, lipstick etc.), and to dress in colorful (attractive) clothing
during her days of impurity, so that she will not become repulsive to
her husband.




12


She may not pour a cup of wine for you in your presence, nor may she
bring it and place it in front of you at the table; nor may she make your
bed in your presence. But when not in your presence, all these things
are permitted, even though you know that she did them. She is
forbidden to pour water to wash your face and hands and feet, even if
the water is cold.

13

Just as she is forbidden to pour a cup of wine for you, so are you
forbidden to pour wine for her. Furthermore, even to send her a cup of
wine specially for her, even if it is a cup over which a berachah has been
pronounced, is forbidden.

14

If you are sick and there is no one but her to attend you, she is
permitted to attend you but without direct contact with your body, but
rather by means of some object. She may even raise you up, lay you
down, and support you. But she must be very careful not to wash your
face, hands, and feet, or make your bed in your presence. If the woman
is sick (when she is a niddah), her husband is forbidden to attend her,
even without touching her, except in a case of extreme emergency,
when it is impossible to find someone else to attend her. If the husband
is a physician, and there is no other physician as competent as himself,
he may feel her pulse, since he is not doing it out of desire or love.

15

All the foregoing precautionary measures must also be observed during
the ""white days,"" that is, the seven days after the flow has ceased, and
even thereafter if she delays her immersion. They are forbidden in all
that was mentioned previously, until after she immerses herself.




16


During the time a woman is a niddah, during her menstruation period
before the white days, it is customary for her not to enter a synagogue
and not to pray. But on the Days of Awe, that is from the first day of
Selichot when multitudes assemble at the synagogue, and she will be
greatly distressed if she does not go, she is permitted to go and pray.
Similarly at the marriage of her son, or daughter, or she has given birth
and it is time for her to go to the synagogue, or for similar things, she is
permitted to do so.

The date of the menses is established by three consecutive times. That
is, if menstruation began three consecutive times, at a similar time, then
this date is her established date of the menses. There are women who
establish their periodic menses at certain days of the month. For
instance, if she perceived the flow three consecutive times, each time on
Rosh Chodesh (New Moon), then her established menses is on Rosh
Chodesh. Also if she perceived it three consecutive times on the fifth of
the Jewish-Hebrew month, then the fifth day of the Jewish-Hebrew
month is the established day of her menses. This way of reckoning is
referred to as ""Menses determined by days,"" for it is consistently the
same day in the month. And even though the number of days between
one perception and the other is not always alike, for some months
consist of only twenty-nine days, while others consist of thirty days,
nevertheless, since she is accustomed to perceive on a certain day of the
month, this day is her established day of the menses.




2


Most women, however, are accustomed to establish a mensal pattern of
""equal intervals"", which is a separation from one perception to another
of an equal number of intervening days. For instance, if she perceives a
flow and twenty-five days elapse, or thirty days or thirty-two days or
the like, and following she again perceives a flow. If she had these
perceptions on three consecutive equal intervals, this is her established
date of the menses, and is referred to as the menses of ""equal intervals.""
And after another interruption of that number of days, the following
day is her established date of the menses. Since the menses cannot be
established by less than three times, and an interval cannot be
recognized by less than two perceptions; therefore, establishment of the
menses of equal intervals requires four perceptions. For instance, if she
perceived a flow today, followed by an interval of twenty-five days, and
she perceived, followed again by an interval of twenty-five days, and she
perceived, followed again by an interval of twenty-five days, and she
perceived, she has had four perceptions, between which there were three
equal intervals, and has thereby established her menses.

3

There are some women who do not have an established date of
perception, neither of the days of the month, nor of equal intervals, but
do experience various physical symptoms. For instance, it is
charactaristic of her to yawn before menstruation, in the manner of one
who stretches his arms from weariness, or like a person who opens his
mouth (yawns) from drowsiness, or like a person who burps because of
the food he has eaten—all of these are included in ""yawning."" Similarly,
if she flatuates or sneezes, or feels some pain in the region of the navel
or the womb, or she has an attack of chills and fever, or the hair of her
body bristles, or her head and (her) limbs grow heavy. If she





experienced any of these symptoms, on three consecutive periods, and
immediately began menstruation, this symptom serves as her
established date of menses. And this is referred to as ""Menses regulated
by physical symptoms."" Yawning and sneezing only when repeated
many times consecutively are regarded as symptoms by which to
establish a date of menses, but if she yawns or sneezes one time, the
date of menses is not established for it is a natural and normal thing.
The date of menses is established by symptoms only if she perceived
each of the three times through one particular symptom. But if once it
occurs through one symptom and once through another symptom, it is
not considered established.
4

Some women establish their menstrual periods by monthly, or by equal
intervals, combined with yawning, sneezing, or similar physical
symptoms. For instance, every fifth day of the month she yawns or
sneezes, and then perceives the flow, or when twenty-five days from
perception elapse, she yawns or sneezes, and then perceives the flow.
This is referred to as ""menses regulated by combining factors."" That is,
it is a combination of a regular date and a physical symptom. If this
pattern occurs three (consecutive) times, then, when that regular day
arrives, and she yawns or sneezes, she must be concerned about her
perception. But with the arrival of that day alone, or with yawning and
sneezing alone, she need not be concerned, since she has regulated her
term only with the two factors combined.

5

A woman whose periods are regular, is at all other times presumed to be
menstrually clean, and her husband may have marital relations with
her, and does not have to inquire about her status. Even if she is partly
asleep he may have marital relations with her, and she does not need to





examine herself, either before marital relations or afterwards. On the
contrary, she should not examine herself in the presence of her
husband, so that he will not be apprehensive, thinking she probably felt
something, for if she did not feel something she would not have
examined herself. Therefore if she examines herself in his presence,
before having marital relations, there is cause for concern, that perhaps
because of his apprehension he might keep away from her. And if she
examines herself in his presence after having marital relations, there is
cause for concern that perhaps he will be apprehensive, thinking that
she probably felt something while having marital relations, and will
keep away from her the next time. Therefore, she should not examine
herself in her husband's presence. But if not in her husband's presence,
the more a woman examines herself, the more praiseworthy she is.
6

A woman whose periods are totally irregular should examine herself
before and after having marital relations. The husband, too, should
wipe himself after marital relation's to ascertain whether there is a drop
of blood. However, if her flow of blood is assumed to have ceased, for
instance, a pregnant woman after the first three months of pregnancy,
or one who nurses, or a woman who is old, these need not examine
themselves.

7

There are women who do not have a regular cycle, but have,
nevertheless, a certain number of days during which they do not
perceive any flow. For instance, a woman who has ascertained that
during the twenty-five days after her perception of a flow, she does not
perceive another flow, but only after that, and then she has no definite
date, because sometimes she delays one day, or two or three days. Since
it has been established three times, that during these days she does not





perceive, a woman until twenty-five days elapse, is regarded during
these days like a woman who has a regular menstrual cycle. But on the
days that follow when she is uncertain, and cannot be presumed to be
menstrually clean, she is forbidden to her husband.
"
"1

The Rabbis expounded (on the verse) ""You shall separate the Children
of Yisrael from their impurities."" Rabbi Josiah said: ""This verse is an
admonition to the Children of Yisrael, that they must separate from
their wives prior to their expected periods."" How long before? Rava
said, ""An onah."" An onah is either a day or a night. If she is accustomed
to perceive the flow during the day, even though she is accustomed to
perceive this flow at the end of the day, she is nevertheless forbidden to
her husband from the beginning of the day. Likewise, if she is
accustomed to perceive in the morning and has not yet perceived,
nevertheless, she is forbidden the entire day until the night. Likewise, if
her periods occur at night, even if she is accustomed to perceive the
flow in the beginning of the night, or if she is accustomed to perceive
the flow at the end of the night, nevertheless she is forbidden to her
husband the entire night. According to many authorities, not only
marital relations are forbidden at this time, but also every other type of
intimacy is forbidden, and it is proper to heed this opinion.

2

Some authorities say that this onah during which you must separate
(from her), is the onah prior to the onah during which she expects her
period. For instance, if she expects her period at night, she is also
forbidden the entire day before. If she expects her period by day, she is





also forbidden the entire night before. And this is the proper course to
follow. However, if you are setting out on a journey, or you have just
returned from one, or if she has performed the ritual immersion on the
night preceding her expected period, you should not heed the stricter
opinion.
3

If a woman does not have regular menstrual periods, then the thirtieth
day after her (last) perception is always considered her fixed period, and
is termed ""an average onah."" For instance, if she perceived the flow on
Monday, of the week when the sidrah of Noah is read, then the
Wednesday of the week when the sidrah of Toldos is read, is considered
her fixed period. In addition, she must also pay attention to the other
occasional times of perception, whether based on equal intervening
days, or on certain days of the month, as will be explained hereafter,
God-willing. Whenever she has reason to expect her period, her
husband must separate from her on the onah before, as has been
explained.

4

Whenever a woman perceives blood, she must suspect perhaps she may
perceive it again on the same date and at the same time. It goes without
saying, if she presently does not have a regular menstrual period, she
definitely must suspect that it might occur again at a similar time, and
thus establish her date of menses. But even a woman who has a regular
menstrual period, and experienced a change in regularity and perceived
the flow not at her fixed period, must also be concerned with this
perception, lest this indicate a change of her regular period to a
different time. But if her regular period has not changed, and she has
an additional perception, not at her regular period, then she does not
have to be concerned (in the future) about this (extra) perception, for





since she (also) has her regular period, she does not need to be
concerned about an irregular period.
5

Let us give an illustration of a woman who has no regular periods. If
she perceived blood on the second day of Rosh Chodesh, of the month
of Iyar, and again on the twenty-fifth of the same month, she must be
mindful of Rosh Chodesh of the month of Sivan, for she should suspect
she might establish her menses on Rosh Chodesh. (Also on the second
day of the month of Sivan, she must be mindful, because it is the
""average onah (period)."") If Rosh Chodesh of Sivan came, (and the
second day of Sivan too), and she has not yet perceived blood, she must
suspect that she may establish her menses by equal intervening days.
And since there was an interval of twenty-three days between
perceptions, (exclusive of the day of the first perception and the second
perception), she must now also count twenty-three days, and then
expect another flow. That is, she has four remaining days of the month
of Iyar, onto which she should add nineteen days from the month of
Sivan, and expect a flow on the twentieth of the month. If the
twentieth day of Sivan came, and she did not perceive blood, she must
be mindful of the twenty-fifth day, as she may establish her menses on
the twenty-fifth day of the month. (She must also be mindful on the
twenty-sixth day, because it is the ""average onah (period)."") However,
for the Rosh Chodesh of Tammuz she need not be concerned, for her
perception on Rosh Chodesh Iyar, has already been eliminated as a
period by her failure to perceive blood on Rosh Chodesh of Sivan. (For
whatever is not established by three (consecutive) occurrences, is
nullified by a one-time failure to occur, as explained hereafter.)




6


An example of a woman who has a regular menses: she has an
established menses of twenty-five day intervals, and one time a change
occured, whereby she did not perceive until the twenty-eighth day. She
must be mindful of the twenty-fifth day from this last perception,
because this is her regular period. If the twenty-fifth day came and she
has not perceived blood, she must take heed of the twenty-eighth day,
because of her last perception. If she has perceived again on the twentyeighth day, she is still forbidden (to her husband) on the twenty-fifth
day after this last perception, because of her regular period. If now, too,
she did not perceive blood on the twenty-fifth day, but rather on the
twenty-eighth day, the twenty-eighth day is set as her fixed period while
the twenty-fifth is eliminated, (for she has replaced it with another,
three times,) and she is permitted [on the twenty fifth day]. If the last
perceptions were not had at equal intervals, if she saw on the twenty
eighth day, on the twenty ninth day, and on the thirty first day, her
previous fixed period is eliminated, and now she has no established
fixed period. She must, therefore, always be mindful of the equal
interval from her last perception (31 days), and for the ""day of the
month,"" and for the ""average period,"" until she establishes a new fixed
period

7

This rule should guide every God-fearing person: If the woman has no
regular period you should always write the date on which she perceived
blood, the day of the month, and how many days elapsed between
perceptions. You must always be mindful in the future of the
intervening number of days between the last two periods. You must also
be mindful of the day of the month, based on her last perception. You
must also be mindful of the ""average onah (period)."" This is how you





should conduct yourself until she establishes a regular period. After she
establishes a regular period, if a change occurs in her period, you must
also be careful to take notice of the new perception, with regard to both
the number of intervening days, and the day of the month. You must
also be careful to remember the day of her regular period because the
regular period is eliminated only after three times, as stated hereafter.
8

A woman who has a fixed period, even if once or twice the date of her
period (arrived), or her characteristic symptoms (arrived), and she did
not perceive blood, even though she is certain beyond any doubt, that
she did not perceive, for instance if during the entire period she had a
cloth [or tampon] packed tightly in place, still her regular period is not
eliminated, and she must still be mindful of it even the third time. But
if the third time also arrived and she did not perceive anything, if she is
absolutely certain that she did not perceive anything on any of these
three times; for instance, if at each time she had a cloth packed tightly
into place throughout the date of her expected period, from then on
her regular period has been eliminated, and she need not be concerned
about it anymore. For every regular fixed period is eliminated after
failing to happen three times, even if it was regular for many years. But
a period which is not established, such as a perception that occured
only once or twice, then if this day arrived, or this particular sign
arrived one time, and she did not perceive her menstrual flow, even if
she did not examine herself, as long as she did not feel anything, she no
longer needs to observe this period. Whatever has not been established
by three consecutive occurrences is eliminated by one time, even
without examination.




9


If a woman has a regular fixed period, then before the time arrives when
she regularly perceives, she should insert a cloth so she will be sure (her
menstrual flow has not begun), for otherwise, she must suspect that
perhaps a drop of blood issued and disappeared without her being
aware of it. If she failed to do so, and the time of her fixed period
passed, she is forbidden to her husband until she examines herself
thoroughly. If during the time of her expected period, she bathed
herself, the examination will be of no avail. She must be stringent and
consider herself to be in an unclean state, because it is presumed that
the flux has come at its regular time. But if she does not have a regular
period, but she is being mindful of an irregular period, if the time has
passed and she has felt nothing even though she failed to examine
herself, she is thereafter presumed to be menstrually clean. However,
with regard to the average period, which is the thirtieth day, her status
is like that of a regular (fixed) period, as has been stated above.

10

If a woman's flow continues two or three days, coming either in a flow
or in drops, the day on which she begins to perceive is considered the
principal day. Some authorities say that, nevertheless, she must always
be mindful of all these days until they are eliminated.

11

Just as a woman must be mindful of the menstrual period as indicated
by the monthly date of menstruation, and by the amount of
intervening days, even after a single occurrence, so, too, must she be
mindful of the menses indicated by physical symptoms alone, or in
combination with (equal interval perceptions) after a single occurrence.
And just as the menses based on monthly perceptions, and by the
number of intervening days, if they are not established (three





consecutive times), are eliminated by a one-time failure to occur, so,
too, the menses based on bodily symptoms alone, or in combination
with one of the above, are eliminated by a one-time failure to occur.
And just as the menses of monthly perceptions, and of equal interval
perceptions that have been established by three occurrences, are
eliminated only by three successive occurrences (to the contrary), so,
too, the menses based on bodily symptoms alone, or in combination
with one of the above, after being established by three occurrences, are
eliminated only by three successive occurrences to the contrary. For
instance, if she has established a period based only on physical
symptoms, for example, if thereafter she yawned three times, and did
not perceive a flow, she no longer has to be mindful when she yawns
again. If it is a period based on a combination when the fixed day
arrives three times, and she yawned and did not perceive any flow, then
the term is eliminated. But a change of days without yawning, or a
change in yawning without a change in days, do not eliminate the term
established by a combination of factors, because we require that this
process of its elimination be similar to the process through which it was
established.
12

A pregnant woman, after three months from the beginning of her
pregnancy, and a woman while nursing a child, are presumed to have
ceased their flow, and need not be concerned about their periods, even
if they have an established periods. Nevertheless she must take heed of
every perception just as a woman is required to be mindful of an
irregular period. When the period of nursing is over, she must continue
to observe her former periods. For instance, if she had an established
period on the day of Rosh Chodesh, she must immediately continue to
expect its occurrence on the first Rosh Chodesh. But if she had a period





of equal interval perceptions, she need not be concerned until she once
again has a perception, and then she must be mindful of her customary
interval between periods.
"
"1

If a woman has an issue of blood as a result of marital intercourse, even
if it did not occur during marital intercourse, but later that night, she is
permitted to have marital relations again after she purifies herself, but
they should be apprehensive of a repetition even after only one such
occurrence. Thus if it occurred on the night of her immersion, then the
next time she immerses, he must be separated from her on the night of
her immersion, for we suspect that perhaps the immersion in
conjuction with the intercourse, causes her to issue blood, and perhaps
she will perceive blood on the night of the following immersion, during
the very act of marital intercourse. But on the night of the third
immersion, they are not bound to separate themselves, because the
main cause for concern was due to the immersion, and since on the
night of her second immersion she did not perceive any blood there is
no cause for further concern. Likewise, if a perception occurred on the
night following her immersion, they must separate themselves on the
night following her second immersion but not after the third
immersion.

2

However, since an unfavorable tendency has developed in this woman,
therefore, even if she has regular periods, nevertheless, the next time she
has marital intercourse, she must examine herself both before and after
intercourse in order to ascertain whether she had a flow again as a result





of marital intercourse. She should also be careful to immediately seek
medical attention; and most certainly if it happened that she perceived
blood during marital intercourse, or shortly thereafter, for if this occurs
three successive times she will be in a very perplexing position, and only
with utmost difficulty can she be permitted to continue living with her
husband.
3

If during marital intercourse, the woman feels that she has become
menstrually unclean, she must immediately say to her husband, ""I have
become unclean."" He should not separate himself from her
immediately while his organ is rigid, for this act in itself affords
pleasure, but he must support himself on his hands and feet, and not
upon her. He should be filled with fear and trembling because of this
sinful occurrence, and when his organ relaxes, he should separate from
her. He should consult a Rav to instruct him regarding a proper
penance for this sin.
"
"1

A woman who is preparing herself for her wedding, must first count
seven (menstrually) clean days, whether she is a minor who has never
perceived blood, or whether she is an aged woman whose flow has long
ceased. Nevertheless, we suspect that perhaps because of her
anticipation, some drops of blood issued from her and disappeared.
Therefore, we regard her as an actual niddah. After having counted the
seven clean days, she must examine herself daily until she performs the
ritual immersion and also after the immersion, until the ordained
consummation of the marital act.




2


If the wedding was cancelled for some reason, and afterward they
agreed to hold the wedding, even though she had already counted seven
clean days the first time, nevertheless she must count them anew,
because a new desire has been created in her. Even if she has examined
herself daily during the interval, it is of no avail. If it was not a definite
cancellation, but they were unable to agree about the amount of the
dowry, or the like, and because of this the wedding was delayed until
they came to terms, or if they postponed the wedding by mutual
consent, from the original day to a different day, they should consult a
poseik to determine if the first clean days are of avail. If they quarreled
at the wedding, and another groom took the place of the first, it is self
evident that there is no validity to the seven clean days that she counted
for the first bridegroom. But even if after consenting to marry the
second groom, she became reconciled with the first one, there is no
validity to the first seven clean days, because her thoughts were diverted
from him. She must count anew, seven clean days.

3

A woman should be careful not to marry before she purifies herself
from her unclean menstrual status. If it is urgent and the wedding must
be held when she is still unclean, or if it occurred that she became
menstrually unclean after the wedding ceremony, but before the
consummation of the marital act; they are forbidden to be alone
together without supervision, until she has performed the rite of
immersion. It is customary to place a male child with the groom, and a
female child with the bride. They may not be alone even during the
daytime, without the children. The children must be old enough to
understand something about marital relations. The girl should not be
fully mature already having desire, lest she permit herself to be seduced,





but of average maturity. Regarding this law there is no distinction
between a groom who has never been married and a widower, or
between a virgin and a widow; for so long as he has never had marital
relations with that woman, we fear he may succumb to his passions,
and therefore, they are prohibited to be alone, without supervision.
4

When one remarries the woman he divorced, she must count seven
clean days. [This rule applies] even if he divorced her while she was
pregnant, and remarried her while she is still pregnant, or he divorced
her while she was nursing a child, and remarried her while she is still
nursing. If he violated this rule and remarried her before [her seven
clean days and immersion], they are permitted to be alone together.
Since he already had marital relations with her, his impulse will not be
so overpowering.

5

Extreme care should be taken that the groom should not lie next to the
bride until the night he wishes to consummate their marriage.

6

One who marries a virgin should perform the ordained marital act, and
even if there is an issue of hymenal blood, he should conclude the act
and need have no scruples about it. However, after concluding the act,
he must separate himself from her, and she is regarded as unclean. And
even if no blood is perceived, we suspect perhaps a drop of blood issued
from her, and was covered up by the semen. Therefore we regard her as
menstrually unclean.

7

A virgin, who performed the rite of immersion after the first marital
act, and perceived blood after the second marital act, and also after the





third and fourth times; it is questionable (halachically) if she is
permitted to remain with her husband.
8

It is permitted to perform the marital act with a virgin on Shabbos even
though the act causes a bruise.
"
"1

A woman who has given birth whether she bore a living child or a dead
one, or even if it was a miscarriage, even if she perceived no blood, she
is regarded as unclean with the uncleanliness ascribed to birthgiving.
The law prescribes that if the child was a male, the mother is unclean
for seven days, (because of her) birthgiving, after which she may count
seven clean days and perform the rite of immersion. If the baby is
female, the mother is unclean for fourteen days (because of her)
birthgiving, after which she counts seven clean days and performs the
rite of immersion. There are places where the accepted custom is that
woman do not perform the immersion within forty days of giving birth
to a male, and within eighty days of giving birth to a female. In a
community where this custom is uniformly accepted, it should not be
treated lightly, for there is some reason for this. Concerning such
instances it is said, ""Hear my son, the instruction of your father, and do
not forsake the teaching of your mother."" But in our regions, there is
no established custom concerning this. The custom prevailing in some
communities that she should not immerse herself until six weeks after
giving birth to a male, and nine weeks for a female, or similar customs,
have no valid reason whatsoever, and have already been abolished in the
holy communities by the Geonim, of blessed memory.




2


Some authorities maintain that you must separate from your wife the
night of the forty-first day after having given birth to a male, and the
night of the eighty-first day after having given birth to a female; for
then there is the likelihood she may perceive the flow the same as
during her menses. Other authorities differ, but a scrupulous person
should be strict about it. If she miscarried, and there is doubt if the
fetus is male or female, you should separate from her the night of the
forty-first day and the night of the eighty-first day.

3

If a woman suffered a miscarriage and expelled something even if it had
no shape of a child, but looked like a piece of flesh or skin, or the like,
she must be stringent and consider herself unclean as after the birth of a
female, or she should consult a poseik, for sometimes it is possible to be
lenient. Also, if she first miscarried a child, and thereafter dropped the
afterbirth, although the child was a male, she must be observant of the
uncleanliness due to birth of a female, because of the afterbirth or seek
the opinion of a poseik.

4

If a woman is certain she has not conceived, and performed the rite of
immersion, and within forty days had a miscarriage, she need not deem
it a birth, for the embryo is not formed in less than forty days. But she
is menstrually unclean, even if no blood was perceived, for presumably
there was some blood which may have disappeared, as it is impossible
for the womb to have opened without issuing blood.
"
"



1


A woman who perceived blood during the days when she is menstrually
clean, must count five days including the day on which she perceived,
plus another four days. Even if she perceived it at the end of the day,
after the congregation, and she herself have prayed the maariv service or
ushered in the Shabbos; if it is still daytime, this day is counted as one
of the five. On the fifth day, towards evening before twilight, she
should carefully examine herself, wash at least her pubic area and put
on clean white undergarments. Her other garments should also be
clean. This procedure is called hefsek tarahah. At night, she should
spread a clean white sheet on her bed. The pillows and cushions should
also be clean. The next day she should begin to count the seven clean
days. It makes no difference whether she noticed much blood or little,
for even if she saw only one drop, or she found only a stain during her
period of purity, she must always wait another five days. Also, if she
continues to bleed the entire five days, but the flow ceased before
twilight (of the fifth day), immediately after the flow ceases, she may
proceed with the hefsek taharah.

2

In case of emergency, as for instance, when she is traveling and cannot
obtain water even to wash the pubic area, this does not delay (the hefsek
taharah), but she must clean the area very well with whatever she can. If
she is able to wash the area with urine, it is sufficient. If she does not
have a fresh undergarment, she may put on an old one, provided it is
first examined to ascertain that it is free from bloodstains.

3

Some authorities are of the opinion that if the congregation had recited
the Maariv prayer, although it is still daytime, she cannot perform the
hefsek taharah (on that day), in order to start counting from the next





day; since the congregation has already accepted it as night. Other
authorities hold she is permitted to do this, even if the congregation
already ushered in the Shabbos. It is best to be stringent about this, but
if she had already done so, you need not be stringent, and she may
perform the hefsek taharah so long as it is not yet twilight. However, if
she too had prayed Maariv, and certainly if she had already lit candles
for Shabbos or Yom Tov, although it is still daytime, she can no longer
perform the hefsek taharah (on that day.) During the summer, when
many congregations pray Maariv when it is still daytime, she should
make her hefsek taharah before that time, as I have already stated. Then,
when twilight draws near, she should examine herself again, for the
principal time for hefsek taharah is as close to twilight as possible. In the
event she did not examine herself that second time, you need not be
concerned about it. Even if she only examined herself in the morning,
when she (checked and) found herself clean, post factum, this is
sufficient.
4

You should always instruct your household to be scrupulous that the
examination of hefsek taharah be performed by inserting cotton cloth;
which should remain there during the entire twilight. Such an
examination will remove her from all possible doubt.

5

There is a custom in some communities, that if the time for putting on
white linen is on Shabbos or Yom Tov, it is postponed until later;
because not every woman knows how to observe the laws prohibiting
washing and wringing. In communities where the custom is to be
lenient and she washes with cold water, she may even wash her entire
body. But when using warm water, she must be careful to wash only the
pubic area and between her thighs; and such water must have been





warmed before Shabbos and before Yom Tov. She must also be careful
not to transgress the prohibition of wringing. She should, therefore, not
wash herself with a cloth, but only with her bare hands. On Yom
Kippur, she must not wash herself at all, but merely wipe herself
thoroughly, (as this is considered an emergency, like the one stated in
paragraph two, since she is forbidden to wash herself ) and put on a
freshly cleaned garment. On Tisha B'Av, and in the seven days of
mourning, she should also not wash herself, but merely wipe herself
(thoroughly). She should also not put on a fresh garment, but an old
one that was examined and found to be free of bloodstains. But after
the seven days of mourning, although washing is forbidden the entire
first thirty days (of mourning), nevertheless, she is permitted to wash
herself lightly, for the purpose of wearing white (for the clean days),
and she is allowed to put on a fresh gown.
6

Every day of the seven clean days, it is preferable that she examine
herself twice daily; once in the morning and once near twilight. Post
factum, even if she did not examine herself but once on the first day
and once on the seventh day, you may be lenient about it. This is true
only (if she examined herself ) on the first and seventh days, but if she
examined herself on the first and eighth days, then only the eighth day
is counted and she is required to add another six days.

7

All these examinations, whether of the hefsek taharah, or during the
seven clean days, must be made with an old white linen cloth, or with a
clean, soft, white cotton cloth. She must insert it deeply, and into the
crevices, to a depth that the male organ penetrates, and then see if there
is any reddish spot on it. If it is impossible for her to insert it to such a
depth, she should at least examine herself to the best of her ability. It is





important that at least one examination be made to the depth the male
organ penetrates. (It is the duty of every husband to instruct his wife
about the laws of examination, for many women are not familiar with
them). Virgins who examine themselves before the wedding, should
also examine themselves to the best of their ability.
8

The examinations must be made by the light of day and not by candle
(artificial) light. Some stringent authorities void the purification if she
had not made at least one examination on the first day and one
examination on the seventh day by the light of day.

9

If she found a stain during the seven clean days, or even if she perceived
a flow of blood, she may perform a hefsek taharah and put on the white
garments on that very day, so long as it ceased before twilight; and on
the following day she may start to count seven days anew.

10

Also a bride who perceived blood before her wedding, and if she must
wait five days, the day of the wedding will be before the time of her
ritual immersion, and it is difficult to postpone the wedding, she is
allowed to make her hefsek taharah immediately, on the day the flow
ceases, before twilight, and count seven clean days from the following
day, in order to be able to immerse herself before the wedding. This is
preferable to having the marriage ceremony take place when she is still
menstrually unclean.
"
"1

On the seventh day [of purification,] during the daytime, before sunset,
she should wash herself thoroughly with warm water, especially in





places where there are wrinkles, and her hidden parts. She should wash
thoroughly and examine her whole body in a room where she can see
and feel efficiently with her hands. There should not remain any
interposing particle or any dirt on her body. She must also thoroughly
cleanse and comb all of her hair with a comb, and disentangle them so
that they will not be matted together or knotted. This whole process is
called chafifah. She must engage in chafifah until nightfall, in order to
perform immersion immediately after chafifah; for preferably the
chafifah should take place close to the [time of ] immersion, and the
chafifah should also take place in the daytime. Therefore, the proper
procedure is to start the chafifah while it is yet day, and prolong it till
nightfall.
2

The chafifah on places where there is hair, should not be done with
anything that tends to entangle the hair. With regard to using soap, our
custom is to be lenient because it cleanses well, and does not entangle
the hair.

3

When there is no bath in the mikvah, and she must make chafifa at
home and afterwards go to perform the immersion, she should take a
comb with her, and comb her hair again at the mikvah.

4

In an emergency, when it is impossible for her to make the chafifah
during the daytime, she can make it at night, but she must do it
properly and not hurriedly. Also, if it is impossible for her to prolong
the chafifah into the night, she may perform the entire chafifah in the
daytime.




5


If her time for immersion is on Friday night, she should make the
chafifah during the day. She must be very careful to complete the entire
chafifah before twilight, and not, God forbid, violate the Shabbos. With
regard to Shabbos candle lighting, it is best, if possible, for her to return
home after the chafifah, or to make the chafifah at home, and after the
chafifah, before twilight, she should light the candles and after that
perform the immersion. If this is not possible, then her husband should
light the candles instead. If this too is impossible, she should light the
candles, and say the berachah over the candles while there is still plenty
of time remaing in the day. Before lighting them she should declare that
she is not assuming the [holiness of ] Shabbos with the lighting; for
when necessary such a stipulation is valid. But the practice of some
women to say the berachah over the burning candles after their
immersion, should be voided, for they are saying a berachah in vain.

6

In communities where it is customary to perform the ritual immersion
after the close of Shabbos or Yom Tov, a Rav should be consulted as to
how they should perform the chafifah.
"
"1

She must immerse her entire body, and all her hair at one time. She
must, therefore, be extremely careful while immersing, that there be
nothing on her that would interpose [between the water and her body.]
For even the slightest particle, at times is considered a chatsitsah (an
interposition), and renders her immersion invalid. Not only must the
water reach the external part of her body, but even the internal parts of
the body, which the water does not penetrate, must nevertheless be fit





for the penetration of water. For example, although it is not necessary
that the water enter her mouth, nevertheless, if there is an intervening
particle between her teeth, her immersion is invalid, as will be
explained, God willing. Every woman must know this rule: All parts of
her body must be clean, and fit for the water to reach them during
immersion.
2

When mucous is outside the eye, it is a chatsitsah (interposition) even if
it is moist. Mucous inside the eye, it is not a chatsitsah, if it is moist but
if it is dry, and has begun to turn green, it is considered a chatsitsah.

3

The dried blood on a wound is considered a chatsitsah, but the matter
(pus etc.) that is inside the wound, is not considered a chatsitsah.
Discharged matter is not a chatsitsah when wet, but when dry, it is a
chatsitsah. Therefore, a woman who has scabs, must rub them in water
until they soften. Even if it is painful to remove the crust of a wound,
or if she has blisters, she must either remove them, or soften them well
in water.

4

The plaster on a wound is considered a chatsitsah. Sometimes plasters
are applied to last for three or four months, and then fall off. During
this time they cannot be removed without tearing the skin, and even if
the woman says she is used to them and does not mind them,
nevertheless, they are considered a chatsitsah. A woman had a wound
which opened, and gauze made of worn linen clothing was inserted
into the hole (of the wound) underneath the bandage. Even if the
bandage is removed and the gauze is not visible because it is deep
inside, it is, nevertheless considered a chatsitsah. (Teshuva Ma'ahava)




5


Filth on the body that resulted from perspiration, is considered a
(chatsitsah) when dry. When a persons hands are soiled with mud,
dough or perspiration, and he rubs them together, crumb-like particles
are formed, and they are considered a chatsitsah.

6

Ink, milk, honey, fig juice, berry juice, carob resin, juice of the fruit of
the sycamore (which is a type of fig), are considered a chatsitsah when
dry, but are not a chatsitsah when moist. All other juices, even when
moist are a chatsitsah. Also blood, even when moist, is a chatsitsah.

7

The coloring used by women to color their faces, hands, and hair on
their heads, is not considered a chatsitsah. Also, a woman whose
occupation is dyeing clothes, or similar work, and as a result her hands
are colored, and all other women engaged in this occupation, usually do
not mind this, it is not considered a chatsitsah.

8

Concerning dirt under the nails, there are a number of factors involved.
It is already the established custom to cut the nails of the hands and the
feet before the ritual immersion. She must be careful to burn them
afterward, for if her husband should step on them, or if another man
should step on them it is dangerous. (When she immerses) on Shabbos
or Yom Tov, and has forgotten to cut them beforehand, some
authorities permit her to have them cut (on Shabbos) by a non-Jewess.
If she has a swelling over the nail, and is thus unable to cut it or to
clean underneath it, and the swelling is so large that the dirt
underneath it is not visible, it is not a chatsitsah. If a woman forgot to
cut her nails and performed the ritual immersion, and became aware of
it before having marital relations with her husband, she must have





another immersion. If she did not become aware of it until after having
marital relations with her husband, she should consult a Rav.
9

She should be careful to remove her earrings and rings before the ritual
immersion.

10

She must clean her teeth before immersing because it is common that
remnants of food are found between the teeth. If she immersed herself
and then found something between them or adhering to them, her
immersion is invalid. Some women are accustomed not to eat meat the
day they are to go to the mikvah, because meat gets between the teeth
more so than other foods, and it is to be feared that even after cleaning
some of it may remain; this is an excellent custom. On Shabbos and
Yom Tov when we do eat meat, she must be careful to clean them very
well. Every woman must be careful not to eat any food between the
chafifah and the immersion. During the entire day of her immersion,
she should not knead dough, or make wax candles, so that nothing will
cling to her. But on Friday if it is her custom to knead the dough
herself, in honor of Shabbos, she should not refrain from doing so;
however, she must be careful to wash her hands thoroughly afterward.

11

A woman who has an artificial tooth, should consult a competent poseik
concerning how to perform the immersion. A woman who has a lead
filling in her dental cavities, and also a woman who is ruptured and
wears a ring in her womb, should consult a competent poseik.

12

Another woman should not hold her during the immersion, because
the water will not penetrate to the place within her grasp. In case of
emergency, the woman who must hold her should first dip her own





hands into the mikvah, and afterward hold her. She should not hold her
tightly with a strong grip, but with a moderate grip that people usually
use.
13

Whenever possible she should not immerse in a place where there is
mud on the bottom because it might be a chatsitsah. In case of
emergency, it is the custom to be lenient as the mud generally found in
water is not very thick. But the mud found at the edge of a river which
clings to the feet is considered a chatsitsah. Therefore, she must be
careful when going to immerse herself in the river to wash her feet well
from the mud that stuck to her, from the edge of the river. If she wants
to set something in the river under her feet upon which to stand during
the immersion, she must consult a competent poseik, for there are many
things upon which it is forbidden to stand during immersion.

14

She should not stand erect during immersion, because certain parts of
her body are concealed by this posture; nor should she bend over so
much that her hidden parts will be pressed together. But she must bend
slightly, until the hidden places of her lower limbs are exposed as they
are when she kneads dough, when she spreads her legs slightly in order
to stand firm and knead briskly. Also, the space under her breasts
should appear as it appears when she nurses a baby. She does not have
to separate her thighs to any great extent, nor to extend her arms from
her body too much, but they should be like they are when she walks. If
she bends over too much, or stands up too erect, her immersion is
invalid, because folds will have been formed in her body, and the water
will not penetrate there. Therefore, it is necessary to watch that the
water level be higher than three tefachim above her navel, for in such a
manner, she will be able to immerse properly. In case of emergency,





when the water level is not so high, she should slowly sit herself down
in the water until it reaches her neck, and then immerse herself in a way
that initially the part of her body still out of the water will not form any
folds. The folds that form afterwards on her body while in the water do
not matter, because the water has already penetrated there. If the water
level is very low, then in an emergency, she may immerse herself in a
prostrate position like a fish provided that her entire body and hair are
submerged in the water at the same time.
15

She does not need to open her mouth to let the water in, nor should
she close it too tightly. If she closed it tightly her immersion is invalid.
Rather she should close her lips together in a natural way. If she put
strands of her hair into her mouth when immersing, her immersion is
invalid, because the water did not reach her hair.

16

She should not close her eyes tightly because folds will be formed under
them, nor should she open them too much because folds will be
formed above them, but she should keep them lightly closed.

17

She must remove the mucus from around the nose as well as from
inside, but whatever is higher up in the nose, is not considered a
chatsitsah. Similarly, she must remove the wax from the ears. Some
authorities say that she should pass water before immersing, if she needs
to. She must also check if she needs to ease herself from stool or water,
so she will not need to restrain herself and render that area
impenetrable to water. If she did not do so, it does not invalidate the
immersion.




18


She should not immerse herself with dust on her feet. If she did
immerse herself and the dust was that thin that the water washed it
away, the immersion is valid.

19

Ordinary lice and fleas do not cling to the body. Therefore the water
penetrates and they are not considered a chatsitsah. But the kind of lice
that cling to the skin, and bite the skin where there is hair, and cling
tightly to the skin, must be removed by means of hot water, or scraped
off with the fingernail. If she is unable to remove them they do not
constitute a chatsitsah. The small lice that cling to the hair, must be
removed because they do constitute a chatsitsah.

20

If a woman has elf-locks, called in Ashkenaz ""moertzep,"" or ""moer
locken,"" and in Polish-Russian, ""kaaltanis,"" and it is dangerous to cut
them, they do not constitute a (chatsitsah.) Even if there are some
threads entangled in them, which cannot be removed, if they are not
visible from the outside, they do not constitute a chatsitsah.
"
"1

If her husband is in town, it is the duty of a woman to immerse herself
at the proper time, in order not to delay the mitzvah of propogation
even for one night; for Joshua was punished for causing Yisrael to delay
the mitzvah of propogation for one night. A woman who delays her
immersion in order to torment her husband, will be severely punished,
God forbid.

2

She is forbidden to immerse herself on the seventh (clean) day before
the stars appear (nightfall). Even if she immerses close to nightfall, and





will be unable to return home before dark, it is also forbidden. Even if
she was delayed and did not immerse herself on the night following the
seventh day, but is immersing herself afterwards, she is also forbidden
to immerse in the daytime. In such a case, too, she should be strict and
not immerse even shortly before dark, and not return home until dark.
She should immerse herself only at night. Brides who immerse before
the chupah, may immerse themselves on the eighth day or thereafter,
during the daytime. In case of emergency, even if the bride must
immerse on the seventh day, she may also immerse during the daytime,
even in the morning after sunrise. But they should not make the chupah
until the stars appear. If the bride immerses after the chupah, even
though it is the first immersion of her married life, she is subject to the
same laws as apply to any other woman.
3

In case of emergency, as when she is afraid to immerse at night on
account of the cold or some other fear, or if the mikvah is outside the
city, and the gates of the city are locked at night, she is allowed to
immerse on the eighth day during the daytime. But on the seventh day,
she is not allowed to immerse in the daytime even in the event of an
emergency. She is permitted to immerse in the daytime on the eighth
day in case of an emergency, only if she makes the chafifah then,
immediately before the immersion. But if the eighth day is Shabbos or
Yom Tov, in which case she would have to make the chafifa a day before
her immersion, and then do the immersion in the daytime, such
practice is forbidden, for two concessions may not be made in one case.
(The concessions being, immersion in the daytime and a long interval
between chafifa and immersion).




4


She should not stand on anything during the immersion. If the water of
the mikvah is deep, and she must stand on a step, she must consult a
poseik.

5

She must not immerse in a place where people might see her, for this
might cause her to immerse hastily, and thus she may not immerse
properly. If she has already performed the immersion, and she is
positive she immersed properly, her immersion is valid.

6

When she immerses herself, she must have in attendance a Jewish
woman, older than twelve years and one day, to see that none of her
hair remains floating on the water. If there is no woman available, her
husband may stand by her to see to it that she immerses properly.

7

She is permitted to immerse on Friday night if it is the proper time for
her immersion, and she was unable to immerse before this, and
provided her husband is in town. But if her husband is out of town, or
if she was able to immerse before, she is forbidden to immerse on
Friday night. If it is after she had given birth, there are many intricate
laws regarding if she is permitted to immerse on Friday night or not, so
she should consult a poseik. A woman whose date of immersion was
before Friday night, but she failed to immerse because her husband was
out of town, and he arrived on Friday, in some communities they are
strict and do not allow such an immersion on Friday night. In a
community without an established custom one should not be strict
about this. In communities where the custom is to be strict about
Friday night immersions, she may not immerse even at the conclusion
of Shabbos. A widow who got married (while menstrually unclean), is





forbidden to immerse for her first time on Friday night since he is
forbidden to have initial marital relations with her on Shabbos.
(However) on the conclusion of Shabbos, some authorities are lenient
and permit her to immerse.
8

After immersing properly, while she is still standing in the water, she
should recite the berachah: Asher kideshanu bemitzvosav vetzivanu al
hatevillah. (""Who has sanctified us with His commandments, and has
commanded us concerning immersion."") She should be strict, and
before reciting the berachah, she should cover her lower limbs with a
cloth, or at least hold her arms together on her body, to serve as a
separation from her lower limbs. She should not look into the water
while reciting the berachah. If she immerses in a place where she is able
to make the water opaque by stirring it with her feet, it is best to do so
before reciting the berachah. Some women are accustomed after reciting
the berachah to immerse one more time, and this is a proper custom. If
she does so, she must take care that the second immersion also be done
properly.

9

After she has properly immersed in the mikvah she is permitted to enter
the bath-house to warm herself, even if it is a steam bath. But according
to some Poskim it is forbidden to wash again in a tub, and this is the
prevailing custom. As far as pouring hot water on herself to warm her
body, she may be lenient. But in a community where custom forbids
this too, she may not be lenient.

10

A woman should be modest about her immersion, and conceal the date
of her immersion. She should not go to the (mikvah) when people are
about. [She should arrange it] so that people will not notice her.





Concerning a woman who does not act modestly, it is said, ""Cursed be
he who lies with any kind of animal."" She should also take care when
leaving the (mikvah) that her friend should meet her and touch her, so
that she not be met first by an unclean thing such as a dog, a donkey, a
pig, a horse, a metzorah, or similar things, or by a person, ignorant in
Torah, and not God-fearing or a non-Jew. If any of these meet her
(first), if she is God-fearing, she will return and immerse again. If one
meets a woman leaving the (mikvah) after her immersion, he may
expect some mishap, God forbid. To prevent this he should recite these
two verses: ""He pours contempt upon nobles and causes them to
wander, in the wasteland, where there is no path"" and, ""He pours
contempt upon nobles and he loosens the belt of the mighty.""
11

With regard to heating the water of the mikvah, some authorities forbid
it and some authorities permit it. The prevailing custom in many
communities is to permit it, but where no such custom prevails, one
should not be lax about it. In a place where it is customary to permit
immersion on Friday night, care must be taken that the water should
not be hot, but lukewarm.

12

With regard to immersion in rivers, according to many great halachic
authorities, of blessed memory, the immersion in a river is valid only
when it is so small that it is certain that the river did not increase due to
rainwater or melted snow, because rainwater and melted snow purify
only when they are gathered together and standing as a mikvah. But
when they are flowing on the ground they do not purify. Only spring
waters purify [even] when flowing on the ground. However, in an
emergency, as when there is no mikvah, it is customary to be lenient,
and to rely on the poskim who rule according to the poseik who says





even when we see that the river was increased from the rain water,
nevertheless, the major increase is from its source under the ground.
For in time of rain, the air is full of moisture, and the sources of the
springs increase and becomes stronger. Consequently, the water in the
river is always mostly from underground springs, and the rainwater is
nullified within it, and therefore it purifies even though it contains
water that flowed on the ground. However, in a place where there is a
mikvah, far be it from anyone to be lenient about it. Even where there
is no mikvah, if possible, it is best to be strict and if the river increased
from rain water, she should postpone her immersion two or three days,
until it resumes its normal level. It is best, if possible, not to immerse in
the place where the river was widened, but rather in the place where it
flows continuously; for in that case there is somewhat more ground for
leniency.
13

With regard to a river which is formed entirely by rain and at times
completely dries up, although during the rainfall some other streams
empty into it, nevertheless, since occasionally it dries up completely,
there are no grounds to permit immersion in it while the water is
flowing on the ground, until the water gathers and remains standing.

14

The laws regarding mikvah are very numerous. Wherever a mikvah is
being made, it should be constructed only under the supervision of a
very renowned poseik, great in Torah and in fear of God. When any
change occurs (in the mikvah), whether a minor or major (change), a
competent poseik should be consulted immediately. Also, when it
becomes necessary to draw the water in order to clean it, a poseik should
be consulted about the proper way to do it.




"
"1

It is a positive mitzvah for the father to circumcise his son, or to grant
the honor and appoint another Jew as his agent to circumcise him. The
father should place the infant on the knees of the sandek, hand over the
knife to the mohel, and stand by him during the circumcision, to
indicate that the mohel is his agent. In the interval between the cutting
of the foreskin and its laceration, the father recites the berachah, Asher
kideshanu bemitzvosav vetzivanu lehachniso etc. ""Who has sanctified us
with His commandments and has commanded us to induct him into
the covenant of our father Avrohom."" You should make an effort to find
the best and most righteous mohel and sandek. It is customary not to
select as sandek, a man who had already been sandek at the circumcision
of another one of his sons. If you have invited a mohel, it is forbidden
to retract and invite another one, for it is said, ""The remnant of Yisrael
will do no injustice and will speak no falsehood."" If you appointed a
mohel, and in the meantime the mohel left the city, and the father,
thinking that he would not return in time for the circumcision,
appointed another (in his stead), but in the meantime the original
mohel returned, he should perform the circumcision.

2

It is customary that all those attending a circumcision, stand
throughout the ceremony, for it is said, ""And all the people stood in the
covenant,"" excepting the sandek, who holds the baby while seated. After
the father recites the berachah, Lehachniso, and those assembled answer
amein, they all say, ""Just as he was initiated into the covenant, so may
he be initiated into the study of Torah, to the Chupah, and to the
performance of good deeds.""




3


It is essential that the mohel be versed in the laws of circumcision, and
he must examine the child to see if he is healthy. The midwife (nurses
etc.) should be alerted that in case she observes some weakness or illness
in the child, she should notify the mohel.

4

Extreme care must be taken not to circumcise a child who is possibly
ill, for danger to human life overrides all other consideration. Moreover,
the circumcision can be performed at a later date, but it is impossible to
ever restore one Jewish life. See Yoreh Deiah, Chapters 262,263 as to
when to circumcise an infant who had been ill and recovered. As soon
as the infant is fit for circumcision, it is forbidden to defer the mitzvah
for any reason, such as to elaborate the festivities or the like. You must
circumcise him immediately when he is fit, but you may not do so on
Shabbos or on Yom Tov, as is stated in Yoreh Deiah Chapter 266.

5

If a woman has lost two sons from the effect of circumcision, as it
appears that the circumcision had weakened their strength, you may
not circumcise the third son until he gets older and stronger. Also a
woman who lost a child from the effect of circumcision, and the same
thing happened to her sister's son, then the other sisters, too, should
not have their sons circumcised until they get older and stronger.

6

If a baby is born during twilight, or close to it, you must consult a
competent poseik as to when he should be circumcised.

7

An infant who dies before circumcision (whether within the eight days
or thereafter,) is circumcised at the grave in order to remove (the
foreskin) which is a disgrace to him, so he should not be buried with
his foreskin which is considered a disgrace to him. No berachah is





recited on this circumcision, but a name is given to him as a
remembrance that mercy will be shown him from Heaven and he will
be included in the resurrection of the dead, and that he may then have
sufficient understanding to recognize his father and his mother. If they
forgot to circumcise him, and they had already buried him with his
foreskin, if they became aware of it immediately, when there is as yet no
reason to suspect that the body has begun to decompose in the grave,
they should open the grave and circumcise him. But if they had not
become aware of it until several days after his death, his grave should
not be opened (Nodah Beyehudah Tinyana No. 164).
8

It is customary to make a feast on the day of the circumcision; for every
mitzvah which Jews accepted with joy, (like the precept of
circumcision), they still perform with joy. It is written, ""I am happy
with your word"" etc. and the Sages explain that this refers to
circumcision. He who can afford to make a proper feast, but
economizes, and makes it only with coffee and sweets, or the like, does
not act properly. If you are invited to a circumcision feast, and you
know that worthy men will be present, you are obligated to attend. It is
also customary to make a feast of various fruits and drinks on the
Friday night before the circumcision. This feast is also considered a
mitzvah. It is also customary that the night prior to the circumcision,
people assemble in the house where the baby is, and study Torah. Some
refreshments are served, but this feast is not considered a mitzvah, for it
is merely a custom.

1


It is a positive mitzvah incumbent on every Jewish man to redeem his
son from a kohein, if his son is the mother's firstborn child. This is done
by giving the kohein five selaim. Our coinage must be of sufficient
value, so that their sum equals five and one-third loit of refined silver.
You may give the kohein even other articles of that value, but not real
property or notes. Therefore you may not redeem your son with paper
money. It is customary to make a feast when performing this mitzvah.

2

If you told a particular kohein that you will redeem your son from him,
you are forbidden to retract your word, but if you did retract and
redeemed him from another kohein, the redemption is valid.

3

You cannot redeem the firstborn before he is fully thirty days old, and
on the thirty-first day you should redeem him immediately, and not
postpone the performance of the mitzvah. You may not redeem him on
Shabbos or Yom Tov, but you may redeem him on Chol Hamoed. It is
customary to do the redemption during the daytime. However, if the
thirty-first day has passed, and you have not yet redeemed the infant, or
if that day is on Shabbos or Yom Tov or on a fast day, you should
redeem him immediately on the following night, and not wait until the
next day, thus, further postponing the mitzvah.

4

The father brings the firstborn before the kohein and informs him that
the infant is the firstborn to his mother, who is an Israelite (i.e. she is
not the daughter of a kohein or Levi). He brings the money, or goods
worth five selaim, and places it before the kohein, and says to the kohein,
""This is my firstborn son,"" etc. and then places the infant before the
kohein. The kohein asks him, ""What would you rather,"" etc., and the





father responds, ""I want to redeem my son,"" etc. While the father still
holds the coins in his hand, before giving them to the kohein, he recites
the berachah: Asher kideshanu bemitzvosav vetzivanu al pidyon habben
""Who has sanctified us with His commandments, and has commanded
us concerning redemption of the firstborn son."" He also recites the
berachah, Shecheyanu, and then immediately gives the coins to the
kohein. The kohein takes the money, and revolves it over the child's
head, and says, Zeh tachas zeh etc. ""This (money) instead of this
(child)."" Afterwards he places his hand on the boy's head and blesses
him, saying, Yesimcha Elokim etc. ""May God make you etc;""
Yevarechechah Hashem Veyishmerechah, May God bless you and keep
you; Ki orech yomim ushnos chaim etc. ""For length of days and years of
life,"" etc. Adonoy Yisumarchah mikol rah etc. ""God shall guard you from
all evil"" etc.). Thereafter the kohein recites a berachah over a cup of
wine. If no wine is available, he may recite a berachah over some other
beverage which is commonly used in the region. But if so, the
redemption should take place before the hands are washed for the meal,
for during the meal, it is not permitted to recite a berachah over any
beverage (other than wine). This is not the case when there is wine, for
then the redemption takes place after the Hamotzi has been recited over
the bread.
5

If the father is not with his son, he may redeem his son from a kohein
wherever he is. In such an event he says to the kohein, ""I have a
firstborn son to redeem,"" whereupon the kohein inquires: ""What would
you rather,"" etc.

6

The Turei Zahav gives a reason for the custom of having the kohein
return all the redemption money or part of it to the father, (and [even]





this requires further deliberation). He who desires to perform the
mitzvah properly, should choose a kohein who is poor, who is learned in
Torah and is God-fearing, and both the father and the kohein should
agree that the money is not to be returned, or else the father should
give it explicitly as a gift on condition that the kohein return it to him.
7

The mother is not obligated to redeem her son; and if the father has
died, the Beis Din (Jewish court) redeems him.

8

If the father violated the law, and did not redeem his son, or if the
father died and the Beis Din failed to redeem him, he himself is
obligated to redeem himself when he becomes Bar Mitzvah, at which
time he recites the berachah, Asher kideshanu bemitzvosav vetzivanu al
pidyon bechor ""Who has sanctified us with His commandments and
commanded us concerning the redemption of the firstborn."" He also
recites the berachah, Shehecheyanu.

9

Kohanim and Levites are exempt from redeeming their firstborn sons.
Even if the daughter of a kohein or a Levite is married to an Israelite,
the son is exempt from redemption. If the daughter of a kohein had
sexual relations with a non-Jew and has become pregnant from him, or
even if she had thereafter become pregnant from a legal marriage, the
son must be redeemed, for his mother was disqualified from the
kehunah (priesthood) by having cohabitation with a non-Jew. (This also
applies to any illicit cohabitation through which his mother's
priesthood is profaned.)

10

If a woman had a miscarriage and thereafter has given birth to a viable
child, a Rav should be consulted (regarding his redemption).




"
"1

Every father is obligated to train his young children in the practice of
all the mitzvos, both Biblical mitzvos, and mitzvos that are Rabbinically
ordained. They should be trained to do each mitzvah, in accordance
with his or her intelligence. It is also his obligation to prevent them
from doing any forbidden act, as is said in the Scriptures, ""Train a child
in the way he should go,"" etc. If words are of no avail, you should
chastise him with a rod, or the like. But you should not strike him
severely as some fools do; a wise person will act intelligently. It is
especially important to watch that they tell no lies, and to train them to
speak the truth, and to avoid oaths. The above things are mandatory
upon fathers as well as teachers.

2

The time for training a child in the performance of positive
commandments is set for each child according to his wisdom and
understanding. For example, when he knows the significance of
Shabbos, it is his duty to hear kiddush and havdalah, and other similar
things. Training the child to keep the prohibitive commandments,
whether Biblical or Rabbinical, applies to every child, who understands
when he is told that something is forbidden to do or forbidden to eat.
Young children should be trained to answer Amein in the synagogue,
and to participate in other aspects of synagogue prayer. From the time a
child answers Amein [to a berachah] he has a share in the World to
Come. They must be trained to behave in the synagogue with awe and
reverence. Children who run about to and fro, and disturb the prayers,
should not be brought to the synagogue.




3


Even one who is not the father of the child is forbidden to give him
forbidden food to eat, or to tell him to do something that is forbidden.
According to most poskim, it is forbidden to give him food that is
Rabbinically prohibited, or to command him to do something that is
Rabbinically prohibited. If the child is somewhat ill and must eat
forbidden food, he may be fed by a non-Jew with food which was
forbidden only by Rabbinic Law.

4

Something which is not forbidden in and of itself, but is forbidden
because of the special day, is not included in the mitzvoh of training.
Therefore, it is permitted to give a child food, to eat before kiddush
even though it is your duty, to train him to make kiddush, but it is
forbidden to give him food [to eat] outside the sukkah. Only (in cases
like) not eating before kiddush, which is similar to a negative
commandment, since it is forbidden to eat before kiddush, is the law
more lenient; but where a violation of a positive command is involved,
it is forbidden to give it to him.

5

It is forbidden to tell a child even if he is under the age of nine, to carry
anything out on Shabbos, even for the purpose of doing a mitzvah, like
taking a Siddur (prayer book) or a Chumash (Bible) to the synagogue,
or similar things.

6

If a child steals something, if it is still intact, you are obligated to return
it; but if it is no longer intact, he is legally exempt from making
restitution even after he becomes of age. But in order to fulfill his
obligation before the judgement in Heaven, he must make restitution
when he becomes of age. Similarly, if he committed other sins in his





youth [before Bar Mitzvah], it is advisable that he accept upon himself
some sort of repentance when he reaches an age of understanding.
Concerning this it is said, ""For the soul to be without knowledge is not
good.""
7

You should not threaten a child that you will hit him after a while, but
if you see him misbehave, either hit him at once or ignore it. A story is
told about a child who ran away from school, and his father threatened
to hit him. The child committed suicide. Our Rabbis, of blessed
memory, said, In dealing with your impulse, your child or your wife;
your left hand should repel [reject] and your right hand should bring
near [accept]. You should not threaten a child with an unclean object.

8

Halachically, it is permitted to allow a Jewish child to be nursed by a
gentile woman. Nevertheless, if it is possible to have him nurse from a
Jewess, you should not let him nurse from a gentile, for it dulls the
spiritual sensitivities of the heart, and causes bad temperament. Also, a
Jewish woman who is nursing and must eat forbidden foods as a
remedy for illness, if possible, she should not nurse the child on those
days.

9

Every father is obligated to teach his son Torah, as it is said, ""And you
shall teach them to your children to speak of them."" Just as it is a
mitzvah to teach your son, so too it is a mitzvah to teach your son's
son, as it is said, ""And you shall make them known to your sons and to
your son's son.

10

As soon as the child begins to talk, you should teach him (the verse),
""The Torah that Moses has commanded us is a heritage for the





community of Jacob,"" and, also the verse of Shema Yisrael etc.
(However you must be very careful that the child is clean when you are
teaching him.) Likewise you should teach him other verses little by
little, until he is strong enough to attend school, at which time you
should engage a teacher for him. You should be careful to choose a
teacher who is God-fearing, in order that he accustom the child from
his youth to be God-fearing. When the child has advanced to the study
of the Scriptures, it is customary to begin teaching him the Sidrah of
Vayikra, which is the Sidrah containing the laws of sacrificial offerings,
for our Sages of blessed memory said, Let those who are pure (the
children) come and engage in the study of purity.
11

The teacher must teach the children the entire day and part of the
evening, in order to train them to study Torah by day and by night. He
must not interrupt the childrens' learning except on erev Shabbos and
on erev Yom Tov at the end of the day. The children are not to be
interrupted from their learning even for the purpose of building the
Beis HaMikdosh

12

A teacher who leaves the children to themselves and goes out, or does
some other work with them, or who teaches carelessly, is included in,
""Cursed be he who does the work of God with a slack hand.""
Therefore, you should appoint as a teacher, only a person who is Godfearing, fluent in his reading as well as exacting. A teacher should not
stay awake at night more than necessary, so that he will not be lazy
while teaching during the day. He should also not fast or eat and drink
too sparingly. Nor should he eat and drink excessively, for all these
things prevent him from teaching efficiently. Any teacher who deviates
from these rules, forfeits his rights and should be dismissed.




13


A teacher should not strike his pupils as one strikes an enemy, [or with]
malice and cruelty, nor with a whip or a stick, but with a light strap.

14

You should not teach the children anything new on Shabbos, i. e.
something they have never learned before, because it is too burdensome
to do on Shabbos. But something they once read, should be reviewed
with them on Shabbos.

15

If a minor finds something, and certainly if someone gave him
something as a gift, it is forbidden to rob him of it.

16

You may not give a Jewish child to a non-Jew to instruct him in reading
and writing or to teach him a trade, and needless to say, that it is
forbidden to give him to a Jewish heretic, which is much worse (than
giving him to a non-Jew), for there is concern the child may follow in
his footsteps.
"
"1

It is written, ""You must not practice superstition nor attribute
significance to [auspicious] times."" What constitutes superstition? He
who says, ""Since the bread fell from my mouth;"" or ""The cane fell from
my hand;"" or ""My son called me from behind;"" ""A raven croaked at
me;"" ""A deer crossed my path;"" ""A snake passed on my right;"" ""A fox
passed on my left, therefore, I will not go on this journey because I will
not be successful."" Similarly, those who on hearing the chirping of a
bird, say: ""May it mean this and not that;"" ""(Now I know) it is good to
do this, or it is bad to do this;"" Similarly, when asked to repay a loan,
he says: ""Please leave me alone for now it is morning, and I do not want





to start the day by making a payment;"" or ""It is the close of the
Shabbos;"" or ""It is the New Moon."" Similarly those who say, ""We must
slaughter this rooster because he crowed in the evening;"" or ""This hen
(should be slaughtered) because she crowed like a rooster."" Everything
similar to these things, are forbidden. Anyone who practices any of
these things, violates a negative command. Some poskim say that if you
do not state the reason why you ordered the slaughter of the hen or the
rooster, but simply say, ""Slaughter this hen"" or ""This rooster,"" it is
permissible to slaughter them, and such is the prevailing custom.
2

Although no superstition may be practiced through a house, a child,
and a woman, they may be regarded as omens. For example, if someone
built a house, or had a child born to him, or taken a wife, and
afterwards he was successful on three occasions, or was unsuccessful, he
may regard this as an omen for the future, and say: ""This house brings
me good luck"" etc. It is also permitted to inquire of a child about the
verse he studied (that day), and rely on it to do a certain thing, for it is
regarded somewhat like a prophecy. Some Poskim say it is permitted to
designate a sign for the future (and to act accordingly): as Eliezer the
servant of Abraham, or Yonason the son of Saul; while other Poskim
forbid it. However, he who walks in integrity; ""And trusts in God,
kindness surrounds him.""

3

What is meant by ""auspicious times?"" One who believes in astrology
and thus says, ""This day is good and this day is bad;"" or this day is a
good day to do this work; or this year or this month is bad for such and
such a thing. Regarding our custom to hold marriages only on the days
when the moon, progresses to its fullness, this is not considered
superstition or auspicious, for this is done only as a favorable sign, as





the coronation of Kings which were held at springs to symbolize the
permanency of his rule. Similarly, it is a good sign to make a wedding
on a day when the moon (progresses) to its fullness. Nevertheless it is
not proper to postpone a wedding on this account, and needless to say,
you should certainly not make the wedding when the bride is
menstrually unclean, on the account of this custom. It is also customary
to begin to study on the New Moon. The custom of not starting
anything on Monday or Wednesday, is permissible according to some
authorities.
4

Our Rabbis, of blessed memory, also said, ""What is meant by meonein?
It refers to one who deceives the eyes. [a magician] In other words, it is
as though he holds peoples eyes and closes them, for he deceives them.
It seems to them as though he is performing wondrous, supernatural
feats, while in reality he is doing nothing, but with slight of hand and
cunning, he deceives them. The entertainers who perform these things
at weddings, are violating a negative command. He who engages them,
is guilty of transgressing (the negative command), ""Before the blind
you shall not place a stumbling block."" Therefore whoever is able to
prevent this, is obligated to prevent it. And it is certainly forbidden to
view these things but if a non-Jew performs these things, it is permitted
to view it.

5

It is forbidden to consult sorcerers unless there is danger to human life,
or if someone fell ill due to witchcraft, or some mishap or evil spirit,
then he is permitted to be cured by a non-Jewish sorcerer.
"

1


It is forbidden to benefit from idols, from its vestments, ornaments and
sacrifices. If any of these things are mingled with even one thousand
legitimate items, it is forbidden to derive benefit from the entire lot.
What are considered its vestments? The vessels that the priest uses for
sacrificial purposes, such as pans and goblets, also the house (church)
that is used exclusively for its worship, the base upon which the idol
stands, also, the musical instruments that are used to play music before
it. What are considered its ornaments? The candles that are lit before it,
the garments that are used to clothe it, or those used to spread before it
for beauty, and the trees that they are accustomed to plant in front of
the idols to beautify them. These are its ornaments and it is forbidden
to benefit from them, and it is therefore forbidden to sit in the shade of
these trees. What are its sacrifices? The various kinds of food that are
placed before it.

2

The idols of a non-Jew, its vestments and ornaments, can be annulled.
Thus, if the heathen actually defaces them so that they can no longer be
used as idols, or as vestments or ornaments to idols, it is permitted to
benefit from them. But for idols of a Jewish heretic, the law of
annullment does not apply.

3

It is permitted to benefit from candles that were lit (in front of an idol),
and thereafter extinguished by a heathen, to be used for his own
benefit, and were subsequently sold to a Jew. Since the heathen
extinguished them to use for his own purpose, this act constitutes their
annulment. Nevertheless, such candles should not be used for the
performance of a mitzvah. Similarly, everything that was used for an
idol, although it has been annulled, and is permitted for common use,





is forbidden to be used for a mitzvah because they are abominable to
the Almighty.
4

Regarding the clothing that the priests wear when they enter the house
of idol worship, some Poskim maintain that they are ornaments of the
priests and not ornaments of the idols, and therefore do not require
annulment; while other Poskim require their annullment.

5

A cross to which they bow down, is a forbidden object unless it is
annulled, but a cross that is hung around the neck, as a momento is a
permitted object [from which profit may be derived].

6

It is forbidden to make anything that is needed for idols; even windows
for the house of idol worship. It is forbidden to sell books that are
exclusive to idol worship, [or books of Biblical Scriptures, that were
copied with alterations designed to make them heretical and to
strengthen their beliefs.] Similarly, selling them something that they
need for their worship is forbidden, if they cannot purchase them
elsewhere. Some Poskim forbid this even when they are able to purchase
the same thing elsewhere, and a righteous person, should be strict
regarding this.

7

It is forbidden to gaze at an idol or at its ornaments, as it is said, ""Do
not turn to idols."" You must keep a distance of four amohs from a house
of idolatry, and certainly from the idol itself so as not to pass by them.
It is forbidden to listen to their musical instruments, or to smell their
incense. If you hear their musical instruments, you should plug your
ears, and if the aroma of their incense comes to you, have in mind not
to derive pleasure from it.




8


If you see houses of idolatry in a settled state you should say: ""God will
uproot the house of the haughty."" (If you see them) in a state of
destruction, you should say: ""Almighty of vengeance, God, Almighty of
vengeance, reveal Yourself.""

9

If a splinter has lodged in your foot, or if your coins were scattered, in
front of an idol, you must not bend down to remove the splinter, or to
gather the coins, because it would appear as though you are bowing to
the idol. Even if there is no one to witness it, it is nevertheless
forbidden. You should rather sit down, or turn your back, or your side
to the idol and then take whatever you need.

10

There is an authority who says that it is forbidden to lend money for
the purpose of building a house of idolatry, or for their ornaments or
for their staff. And you most certainly are forbidden to sell them
ornaments. He who refrains from doing these things will prosper. You
should not bind books dealing with idolatry; except for their law books
and literature. [Even] if you fear this will incur their hatred,
nevertheless, whatever you can do to evade doing so, you must evade it.

11

In a place where Gentiles assemble, and say that there they are forgiven
their iniquities, it is forbidden to do business with them there.

12

It is forbidden to mention the name of an idol, whether for some
purpose, like saying to your friend: ""Wait for me near such and such
idol,"" or without a purpose, as it is said, ""And the name of other gods
you shall not mention."" It is forbidden to cause a Gentile to mention
the name of an idol, as it is said, ""It shall not be heard by your mouth,""
that is, it should not be heard because of you. However, if a Gentile is





obligated to you to take an oath (as in a law suit), some Poskim are
lenient and permit him to swear [by his idol.] The names of their
holidays, which are named after people, may be mentioned without
reservation; this is provided you do not refer to them in the same way
the Gentiles do, in a manner indicative of respect.
13

All kinds of mockery are forbidden, except mockery of idols which is
permitted.

14

It is forbidden to give a gift to a Gentile that is not your acquaintance,
as it is written, ""You shall not show them grace;"" and this is explained,
""You shall not give them a free gift."" But, if he is an acquaintance, it is
not considered a free gift, for in time he will return this favor, or he has
already compensated for it, and it is like a sale (and not a gift).

15

It is forbidden to praise them, even as much as to say, ""How handsome
that Gentile is,"" and certainly you are not to speak in praise of his
deeds, or to cherish any of his utterances, for this is also included [in
the negative command] ""You shall not show them grace,"" that is, do
not ascribe any grace to them. But if your intention by praising him, is
to give thanks to the Holy One, Blessed be He, for having created such
a handsome being, it is permissible.

16

It is permitted to help their poor, visit their sick, bury their dead,
eulogize them, and console their mourners, for the purpose of
maintaining peaceful relations with them.

17

A Jew should not be alone with a Gentile, because they are suspect to
commit homicide.




18


A non-Jewess must not be allowed to nurse a Jewish child in her own
house, even in the presence of others. But in the house of a Jew, she is
permitted to nurse him when others are present, [or at least if they are]
going in and out, provided that they do not leave him alone with her at
night.

19

A Jewess should not act as midwife for a non-Jewess, unless she is
known to be a [professional] midwife, for then it is permitted (so as not
to incur hated). This too is permitted only if she is compensated and
only on a weekday. A Jewess should not nurse a non-Jewish child, even
if she is compensated. If she is engorged with milk and it is causing her
discomfort; she is permitted to nurse him.

20

It is forbidden to teach a trade to a Gentile.
"
"1

It is written: ""You shall not make with Me gods of silver."" Our Rabbis,
of blessed memory, received by tradition that this verse is a command
not to draw pictures of objects of the heavens above or the spheres
below. You shall not make anything resembling My ""attendants"" that
minister before Me. Therefore, it is forbidden to draw a picture of the
""four faces"" on the Chariot, the images of the Seraphim, Ophanim, and
the ministering angels. It is also forbidden to draw pictures of the sun,
the moon, and the stars. Even if they are not in relief, it is forbidden to
make them, even when made for a non-Jew. However, it is permissible
to keep them in your house, if they are not in relief. You must not tell a
non-Jew to make them, because telling a non-Jew (to do a prohibited





act) is forbidden in regard to all prohibited acts, as it is pertaining to
acts prohibited on Shabbos.
2

It is also forbidden to sculpture the image of a person. It is prohibited
to sculpture even the face of a person, and it is even forbidden to keep
it in your house, unless you disfigure it to some extent. However, only a
full face is forbidden, that is, when it has two eyes and a complete nose,
but if it is only half a face, a profile, like some artists who form one side
of the (picture) face, it is not forbidden.

3

If a ring has a seal on it, consisting of a person's image, and the image
was made in relief, you are forbidden to keep it; but it is permissible to
seal with it because then the signature becomes depressed. If the image
on the ring is depressed, you may keep the ring, but you are forbidden
to seal with it, because it comes out in relief.

4

It is forbidden to gaze at the image of a person, for it is called a pessel
(idol), and this is in violation of the Scripture, ""Do not turn to idols.""
However, with regard to the images on coins, since everyone is
accustomed to them, it is permitted. A very pious person is even careful
about this.

5

It is forbidden to make a house modeled after the sanctuary of the Bais
HaMikdosh, having the same length, height, and width, or a vestibule
modeled after the ulam in the Bais HaMikdosh or a court modeled
after the azarah in the Bais HaMikdosh or a table modeled after the
Table that was in the Bais HaMikdosh, nor a candelabra modeled after
the menorah that was in the Bais HaMikdosh. But you may make one
with five stems, or of six or eight (stems), but not of seven stems, even





if it is made of metals other than gold, and even without cups, knobs,
and flowers, and even if it is not eighteen tefachim high, because all
these things were not essential even in the Bais HaMikdosh Menorah.
6

Some are accustomed to make a seven-branched candelabra by shaping
six in a circle and one in the middle. But many Poskim forbid this, and
the stricter opinion should be followed when there is doubt regarding a
Scriptural prohibition.

7

Anyone who prepares anointment oil with the same formula and
weight as prescribed in the Torah, is liable to the penalty of excisement.
If he did it unknowingly, he is liable for a sin-offering, providing he had
prepared it with the intention to anoint himself with it. Anyone who
prepares incense with the eleven ingredients prescribed in the Torah,
and in the same proportion, even if he prepared only one-half, or onethird of that quantity, is liable to the penalty of karess (excisement). If
he prepared it for the purpose of making a study of it, he is guiltless.
"
"1

It is written in the Torah, ""You shall not imprint marks upon yourself.""
What is meant by ""imprint marks""? A mark which is absorbed and
sunken into the skin, so that it can never be erased. He who makes an
incision in his skin and fills the incision with stirium, or ink, or other
dyes that leave a mark; likewise, if he first dyes (the skin), and then
makes an incision on the dyed area, is guilty of transgressing a negative
command. Nevertheless, it is permitted to put ashes and other things
on a wound for medical purposes, even if a mark will remain; for (in





such cases) the wound will also leave a mark, and it will be apparent
that you did not do it for the purpose of tattooing.
2

It is written; ""You shall not cut into your flesh for the dead."" It is also
written: ""You shall not cut yourselves nor make any baldness between
your eyes for the dead."" Gedidah and seritah [the Hebrew terms used in
the Scriptural text respectively] are one and the same, and are forbidden
whether in the presence of the dead, or not in the presence of the dead.
Even to strike your hand onto your flesh so that blood comes out is
forbidden. And to do this even for any other kind of grief is also
forbidden.

3

""Baldness"" refers to plucking out hair of the head in mourning for the
dead. Even the plucking out of a single hair is forbidden. Women, are
included in the prohibition of making baldness, and certainly in the
prohibition of cutting.
"
"1

There are two ""corners"" of the head, located at the base of the (sides of )
the head, at the juncture of the temple and the cheek, on both right
and left sides near the ears. Even shaving [cutting these corners] with a
scissors close to the skin as with a razor, so that nothing remains of the
hair close to the skin, is forbidden according to some Poskim.
Therefore, if it is necessary to shave them for medical reasons, you
should be careful not to shave close to the skin. The area of the corners
that are forbidden to shave includes the hair from the top of the
forehead to below the ear, at the point where the bottom jaw widens
and spreads outward.




2


The Torah forbids shaving the corners of the beard, only when done
with a razor. The beard has five ""corners"" and there are many opinions
as to what they are. Therefore, a God-fearing Jew, should not use a
razor on any part of the beard, even on his upper lip or under the chin.
There is no difference between a razor and a sharp stone which cuts the
hair, such as pigment or pumice stone, which are also forbidden. Those
who remove their beard by means of a cream prepared from lime and
avirem, should be careful not to scrape off the cream with a knife,
which might cut the hair; but they should scrape it with a strip of wood
or something similar.
"
"1

A man is forbidden to wear even one garment worn by women, even
though he can be recognized as a male by his other garments. Likewise
a woman is forbidden to wear even one garment worn by men. Not
only are feminine garments forbidden to men, but also every ornament
and all toiletries and cosmetics that are used exclusively by women, of
that region, are forbidden to a man for purposes of adornment or
enhancement. Likewise, everything used exclusively by men, is
forbidden for use by a woman.

2

A man is forbidden to remove the hair from his armpits and the genital
area, even with a pair of scissors when it is cut close to the skin, if it
appears that it was done with a razor, for this is the custom of women.
It is forbidden to rub the hairs of the armpits or of the genital area with
the hands, so that they should fall out, but it is permitted when done





with a garment. One who has scabs in his armpits, or in the genital
area, and the hair causes him discomfort, is allowed to remove them.
3

A man is forbidden to pick even one white hair from among the black
ones, for this is the way women beautify themselves, and is forbidden
because of the enjoinder that ""A man shall not wear (a woman's
garment)."" It is also forbidden to dye even one white hair to make it
black. A man is also forbidden to look into a mirror. However, if you
look into it for medical purposes, or when you are cutting your own
hair, or wish to remove stains from your face, or remove feathers from
your head, it is permitted (to use a mirror). In a region where it is
customary for men, to look into mirrors, it is permissible for any
reason.
"
"1

It is written: ""And bread, and roasted grain and fresh grain you shall
not eat until this very day"" etc. This means that it is forbidden to eat of
any of the five species [of grain] [wheat, barley, oats, spelt, rye] from the
new grain crop until after the offering of the omer, which was offered
on the sixteenth day of Nissan. In a time when there is no omer [as in
our times], it is forbidden to eat the new crop the entire day. In
countries outside Eretz Yisroel, where two days of Yom Tov are
celebrated, because of the doubt (of the actual day of Yom Tov,) it is
also forbidden the entire seventeenth day until the beginning of the
night of the eighteenth day. Grain which had been sown and taken root
before the sixteenth day of Nissan, is made valid for use by (bringing)
the omer, and it may be eaten immediately after it is harvested.





However, if it did not take root before the sixteenth of Nissan, it is
forbidden until next year's omer is brought.
2

According to most of the greatest Poskim, the above prohibition, even
outside Eretz Yisroel, is a Scriptural prohibition. Therefore we must pay
careful attention to grain crops that are sometimes sown after Pesach or
so close to Pesach that it has not taken root before the sixteenth of
Nissan, such as barley and oats, and in some places also wheat, for they
are forbidden until after the seventeenth of Nissan of the next year. (If it
had taken root on the sixteenth day of Nissan, it is permitted at the
beginning of the seventeenth night of Nissan of the next year in any
event.) Also the beer made from this grain, is forbidden until after the
next Pesach. Also the lees are forbidden. If dough was leavened with it,
even if the dough was made from the old grain crops, the entire dough
is forbidden due to the yeast. Concerning crops about which there is a
doubt whether it is old or new, you should consult a Poseik.

3

Some Poskim maintain that the prohibition of eating the new crops
applies only to grain that grew in the field of a Jew. Even if the field
belongs to a non-Jew, but it has been leased by a Jew, the law of new
crops applies to this grain. However, if the grain grew in the field of a
non-Jew, the prohibition of new crops does not apply. Many people rely
on this in difficult circumstances. Nevertheless, if the grain grew in the
field of a Jew, it is not permitted at all. Most Poskim disagree, and
maintain that even grain that grew in the field of a non-Jew is subject
to the prohibition of new crops; and a blessing will come upon one
who is strict about it.

It is forbidden to derive benefit from the fruit of a fruit tree, whether of
a Jew or of a non-Jew, even if they grow in a flower pot without a hole
on the bottom, until after three years from its planting. It is also
forbidden to derive benefit from their pits and skins. These three years
are not reckoned from day (of planting) to day. Rather if you planted a
tree before the sixteenth day of the month of Av, since there are still
forty-four days to Rosh Hashanah, they are counted as one year, because
it takes fourteen days for it to take root, and thereafter, the thirty
remaining days of the year are counted as a full year. We then count
two more years from the month of Tishrei (from Rosh Hashana). But if
the tree was planted after the sixteenth of Av, that part of the year is not
counted at all, and you must count three years from Tishrei.

2

The fruit of the fourth year's growth are called neta revai (growth of the
fourth year) and must be redeemed. How does one redeem them? You
pick them after they are fully ripe, and take a silver coin or produce that
is permitted to eat, to the value of a perutah, and say: ""With this I
redeem these fruits of the fourth year."" You then take the coin or the
produce, destroy it and throw it into a river. You do not recite a
berachah on the redemption of neta revai that grew outside of Eretz
Yisroel.

3

Whether you have planted a seed, or a branch or transplanted a tree
you must consider the fruit as orlah. However, if you graft a branch
upon a tree, or if you are mavrich, which means making a hole in the
ground, and bending one of the branches of the tree, and inserting the
middle of the branch in the ground, leaving the end protrude above the





ground; even if it was (later) cut off from the trunk of the tree; in lands
outside Eretz Yisroel, the laws of orlah do not apply.
4

If a tree was cut down, and one tefach of stump remains above the
ground, then whatever grew out of that stump is not subject to the laws
of orlah. But if the stump is less than a tefach high, whatever grows out
is subject to the law of orlah, and we count its years from the time the
tree was cut down. If a tree was uprooted and some of its roots
remained attached to the ground, even if they are as thin as a needle
used for stretching the garment after weaving, it is a fact that it can
sustain itself without additional earth, and its fruit is not subject to the
law of orlah, even if you added much more dirt.
"
"1

The prohibition against the grafting of diverse tree species is implied in
the verse: ""You shall not sow your field with diverse seeds."" Therefore it
is forbidden to graft a branch of one kind of tree upon another, such as
the branch of an apple tree upon a citron tree, or a branch of citron
upon an apple tree. Even between similar species, like a branch of a
[cultivated] apple tree upon a wild apple tree, since they are two
varieties of apples, they are forbidden to be grafted with one another. A
Jew is forbidden to allow a non-Jew to graft two diverse kinds of trees
for him.

2

It is forbidden to maintain a tree upon which another kind has been
grafted, but it is permitted to eat its fruit. It is permitted to take a
branch of a grafted tree and plant it elsewhere.




3


Sowing a vineyard with two kinds of seeds, or sowing a field with two
kinds of seeds, is not prohibited outside of Eretz Yisroel unless you have
sown two kinds of grain or two kinds of vegetables together with the
seeds of the vineyard.
"
"1

It is forbidden to breed a male and female of two diverse kinds of
animals, beasts or fowl. Even to merely cause cross-breeding is
forbidden.

2

It is forbidden to do work with two diverse kinds of animals, such as
ploughing with them or let them pull a wagon. Even to drive them
merely by sound, such as yelling at them is forbidden, if they are
harnessed together. Therefore if the cart of a non-Jew is being drawn by
diverse kinds of animals, and the cargo of a Jew is on the cart, that Jew
is forbidden to walk alongside the cart, for it is likely that he will yell at
them, to make them go faster, which is forbidden as it constitutes
driving diverse kinds of animals.

3

If a cart is being drawn by diverse kinds of animals, it is forbidden to sit
on it even if you do not drive them.

4

If a wagon is being drawn by one kind of animal, you may not tie
another kind of animal to the side of the cart or behind it.

5

It is forbidden to tie two diverse kinds of animals together even if only
to prevent them from running away. You must be careful about this





with regard to fowl, not to tie them together, as some people are in
error concerning this.
6

A mule is bred by a horse and a donkey, and it has two species. One is
bred by a stallion and a she-donkey and the other by a mare and a
donkey. These mules are considered diverse kinds of beasts. Therefore,
if you wish to hitch two mules together, first examine the features of
their ears, tails, and voices. If these are similar, it indicates that their
mothers are of the same kind and it is permitted to hitch them
together. Some Poskim maintain that even a single mule is considered a
mixture since it was bred from two species, and it is forbidden to do
work with it or to ride on it.
"
"1

[A garment made of ] wool of ewes or rams, mixed with linen is
forbidden, for it is kelayim (shaatnez). Whether a woolen garment was
sewn to a linen garment even with silk or hemp thread, or whether a
woolen garment was sewn with linen thread or vice versa, whether linen
thread was tied with woolen thread or braided together, all of these are
forbidden for they are shaatnez. Sewing one stitch and tying it, or
sewing two stitches even without tying them is enough of a connection
to make it shaatnez. Therefore, it is forbidden to join a woolen garment
with a linen garment even with a needle [pin] without thread.

2

Sheepskins from which clothing is made, may be sewn with linen
threads, and we are not concerned with the woolen hairs although they
are joined with linen thread, because these woolen hairs are not
considered threads and are of no use and are considered non-existent.




3


To join wool and linen (flax) with something between them, for
example, to take a piece of leather and sew or fasten a piece of wool on
one side and a piece of linen on the other side, is forbidden by
Scriptural law, according to the Rambam; but some Poskim permit it.
Therefore, according to the latter opinion, skins sewed together with
linen threads may be used as a lining for a woolen garment. (And
though it is possible that the hemp thread, with which the skins are
sewn to line the woolen garment, will penetrate among the flax threads
with which the skin were sewn, we are not concerned about it). And
this is the prevailing custom. Nevertheless, one who is spiritially
sensitive, should be strict and heed the opinion of the Rambam.

4

Even if ten mats [lie] one on top of the other, and the bottom one is
shaatnez, it is forbidden to sit on the top one.

5

If a large garment contains shaatnez at one end, it is forbidden to cover
yourself even with the other end, even if the shaatnez part is resting on
the ground.

6

If you sew a garment of shaatnez for a gentile, you may sew it in the
regular manner, even though the garment rests upon your knees,
provided you do not have intention to derive pleasure from its resting
on you. Also clothing dealers, who carry [coats] on their shoulders to
sell them, are permitted (to carry them) provided they do not intend to
use them for protection from the cold or the rain. Nevertheless, Godfearing people carry them on a stick.

7

Handkerchiefs, and bath towels, tablecloths and similar things, also the
cover of the lectern in the synagogue on which the Torah is read, are





subject to the law of shaatnez. It is also forbidden to have curtains
containing shaatnez, but the curtain covering the Holy Ark may be
made of shaatnez.
8

It is permitted to ride in covered wagons, (coaches) which are
upholstered on the inside, with woolen cloth containing shaatnez,
providing you are careful not to lean on the sides that contain shaatnez.
You must be especially careful not to sit on cushions containing
shaatnez. Some Poskim even permit to sit on such cushions, since they
are made in such a way that they do not bend over the sides of the
person.
"
"1

If a Jew's, clean [kosher] animal gives birth to a firstborn, it is a mitzvah
(for the owner) to sanctify it and say ""This is holy;"" for it is said, ""You
shall sanctify it to Adonoy, your God."" If he did not sanctify it, it is
holy on its own accord from the womb, and it must be given to the
kohein regardless if it is perfect, or if it received a defect after its birth,
or even if it was born with a defect. However, it should not be given to
the kohein when it is very young, because this does not do honor to the
kohein. The owner should raise it until it is somewhat grown up, that is
thirty days for a small animal (sheep or goat), and fifty days for a large
animal (cow). If a kohein cannot be found, the owner must care for it
until a kohein comes along.

2

If, within this time the kohein said to the owner: ""Give it to me and I
will raise it,"" if it does not have a defect, he is not permitted to give it to
him, because this would appear as if the kohein is doing the Yisroel





(owner) a favor (that he is tending it for him) in consideration of his
giving the animal to him. And this is forbidden, for it is tantamount to
robbing the other kohanim. However, if the animal was blemished
during this time, and the kohein said to the owner, ""Give it to me so
that I may eat it,"" it is permitted to give it to him since he may
slaughter it immediately.
3

At present if the kohein does not want to accept the animal, because it is
too bothersome to raise it until it is blemished, he is not allowed to
refuse it because it looks as though he is showing contempt for the
priestly gifts. Nevertheless, the Yisroel is forbidden to give it to the
kohein in order to vex him or to take revenge on him. If he does so with
this intention, the kohein need not accept it. Similarly, if the Yisroel was
negligent in that he was able to sell the animal to a Gentile before it
gave birth and he did not sell it, the kohein need not accept that
firstborn; rather the owner himself must raise it until it becomes
blemished, and then give it to the kohein.

4

In our times, the firstborn must be kept until it is blemished, and upon
receiving the blemish, it must be shown to three Torah scholars one of
whom must be an expert, to know if it is a permanent blemish, and, if
it is, they permit its use. Afterwards it is slaughtered and if found to be
kosher, it may be eaten even by a Yisroel ([and certainly by a kohein]).
However, it should not be sold in the meat market, or weighed out by
the pound and no part of it may be given to the dogs, and you may not
sell, or give, any part of it to a Gentile.

5

When a firstborn sustains a blemish, and there are men in the area who
are competent to rule that it is permitted, it should be shown to them





immediately. Once it has been permitted, it should not be kept a long
time. If it was permitted during its first year, it may be kept until it is a
year old. If it was permitted near the end of its first year, or after its first
year, it should not be kept for longer than thirty days. If the owner
transgressed and kept it longer, it is not disqualified because of this.
6

The kohein must raise the firstborn until it sustains a blemish. He may
sell it to a Yisroel whether it has a blemish or whether it does not have a
blemish, providing the Yisroel treats it in a manner befitting the
holiness of a firstborn, and is also not buying it for commercial
purposes.

7

It is not permitted to be margil the firstborn. This means it must not be
skinned in one piece, from its feet upward, for it would appear
disgraceful to skin the sacred [animal], with the intention of making
bellows of it (the skin).

8

If the firstborn is slaughtered and found to be a treifa, it is forbidden to
benefit from its hide and its meat, and it must be buried. Similarly, if it
dies a natural death it must be buried. It is customary to wrap it in a
sheet, and bury it deep in the ground of the cemetery.

9

It is forbidden to fleece or to do work with the first born regardless if it
is blemished or not. Even if some wool came off by itself, no benefit
may ever be derived from that wool. However, the wool that is on its
body, when slaughtered after receiving a blemish, is permitted for the
slaughtering permits the wool for use just as it permits the use of the
meat and the hide.




10


The firstborn is not permitted to be eaten unless it sustains a blemish.
It is forbidden to close it up in a vault so that it should die of its own,
for this would be destroying a sacred thing.

11

It is forbidden to make a blemish in a firstborn, or even to cause a
blemish indirectly; for example, to put dough on its ear, in order for a
dog to grab it and bite off its ear with it; or to cause a blemish in some
similar way. It is forbidden to tell a Gentile to make a blemish in a
firstborn, but it is permitted to give it to a Gentile to raise it or watch
it.

12

If an animal is purchased from a Gentile, and it is not known if it has
given birth before or not, and now it has given birth while in the
possession of the Jew, its status as a firstborn is doubtful, and even if the
Gentile innocently volunteers the information that it had previously
given birth, it is of no avail. Even the characteristic signs in the cracks
of its horns are of no avail. And even if she was being milked, it is of no
avail, unless we see her nursing a calf. If she is being milked, and the
Gentile innocently volunteers, (not for the purpose of promoting the
sale,) and states that she has previously given birth, these two things
together are proof with regards to cows, but not with regards to goats.

13

Kohanim and Levites are also subject to the laws regarding the firstborn
of clean animals, except that the kohein sets it aside, and keeps it for
himself and maintains it in the state of holiness that is due a firstborn.

14

If a Gentile and a Jew are partners in an animal, or a Jew agrees to raise
an animal of a Gentile, and share equally in the offspring, they are
exempt from the laws of the firstborn for it is said: ""Whatever opens





the womb among the Children of Yisrael,"" meaning, all of it must
belong to a Jew. If a Gentile agrees to raise an animal of a Jew, and share
equally in the offspring, according to many Poskim it is of no avail, but
the Jew must sell the mother to the Gentile.
15

It is a mitzvah to sell to a Gentile the clean animal (before it gives
birth), or to form a partnership with him before it gives birth, in order
to exempt it from the laws of the firstborn. And although (by doing
this), it circumvents the holiness of the firstborn, it is, nevertheless,
preferable so that no violations will be committed with regard to its
wool and its use for work. Transferring the title (of the calf ) to the
Gentile when the calf is yet unborn is of no avail, since it is something
that has not come into existence; but the title of the mother must be
transferred as well. The transfer of the title should be done in this
manner: the owner should come to terms with the Gentile regarding
the price of the cow, and also rent him the place that the cow now
occupies; the Gentile should give him a perutah, and the Jew should say
to him, ""With this perutah you shall acquire the place that the cow now
occupies, and this place will acquire the title of the cow for you. It can
also be done in this manner: after they come to terms about the price of
the cow, the Gentile should give him a perutah, and then lead the cow
into his own premises, or into an alleyway, whereby he acquires title
both by meshicha (actual transfer) and with money. Even if he returns
the cow afterwards to the premises of the Jew it does not matter.
"
"1

If a Jew has a female-donkey that gives birth to a firstborn male, it is a
mitzvah to redeem it. With what do you redeem it? With the young of





sheep or goats whether male or female, whether large or small, whether
perfect or blemished; provided it is not a treifa, it is not slaughtered,
and is not a ben pekuah. This lamb must then be given to the kohein.
From when are you obliged to redeem it? At anytime from the day it
was born until it dies. However, it is a mitzvah to redeem it
immediately, in order not to delay the performance of the mitzvah.
After it has been redeemed it remains in the owner's possession, and is
no longer considered sacred. Also the lamb in the possession of the
kohein is not considered sacred.
2

Immediately, upon setting aside the lamb to be exchanged for the
firstborn donkey, the firstborn donkey is considered a secular item even
before the lamb is given to the kohein. Therefore, as soon as the lamb is
set aside, this berachah is recited: Asher kidishanu bemitzvosav vetzivanu
al pidyon petter chamor ""Who has sanctified us with His
commandments, and has commanded us concerning redemption of the
firstborn donkey.""

3

Before it is redeemed, it is forbidden to have any benefit from it, even if
it was already given to the kohein. Even the kohein is forbidden to use it
until it is redeemed and has taken the lamb for himself. If it died before
it was redeemed, it must be buried

4

If the owner chooses not to redeem it, he strikes it with a hatchet on
the back of its head, until it dies, and then buries it, as it is forbidden
for use. The mitzvah of redemption takes preference over the mitzvah
of breaking its neck.




5


Kohanim and Levites are exempt from the mitzvah of redeeming the
firstborn of their donkeys. The daughter of a kohein or Levi are also
exempt, but their husbands are obligated to redeem the firstborn of
their donkeys. Partnerships with a kohein or a Levite, and also
partnership with a Gentile, are exempt from the mitzvah; but it is
forbidden to form a partnership with them, or to sell it to them in
order to nullify its sacredness, since this may be achieved through
redemption or by breaking its neck.
"
"1

It is a mitzvah to lend money to Jews who are in need, as it is said, ""If
you lend money to My people, to the poor amongst you,"" etc.
Although it is written ""if"", our Sages of blessed memory, received the
tradition that this ""if"" is not an option, but an obligation. The Mechilta
states that the verse, ""If you lend money to my people,"" denotes an
obligation. Why do you say it is an obligation? Perhaps it is really
optional (since it states ""if"")? Because we can infer from the verse, ""And
you shall surely lend him,"" that it is obligatory and not optional. The
word ""if"" written here means, when you lend money, you should lend
it to My people, and not to heathens. And to whom of My people? To
him that is with you. From this they inferred that your poor relatives
take precedence over other poor people, and the poor of your city take
precedence over the poor of other cities. The mitzvah of lending money
to a poor person is greater than giving charity to a poor beggar, for the
latter has already been reduced to begging, while the former has not yet
reached this stage. The Torah is provoked with one who refuses to lend
money to the poor, as it is said, ""And your eye be evil against your





needy brother"" etc. Concerning the one who lends to the needy in time
of his distress, the Scripture says, ""Then you shall call and God will
answer.""
2

Even if a rich man needs to borrow money, it is a mitzvah to lend it to
him, and to cheer him with kind words, and to give him proper advice.

3

It is forbidden to lend money without witnesses, not even to a Torah
scholar, unless you are lending against a security. To lend money with
legal documentation is the best course to take.

4

It is forbidden to demand payment from the borrower, when you know
that he is unable to pay. It is forbidden even to appear before him, for
he may be ashamed to see the lender, at a time when he is unable to
repay the loan. Concerning this it is said, ""You shall not be unto him
like a creditor.""

5

Just as the lender is forbidden to demand payment from the borrower,
so, too, is the borrower forbidden to withhold his friend's money, and
tell him, ""Go away and return later,"" when he actually has the money;
as it is said, ""Do not tell your friend, ""Go away and return later.""

6

A borrower is forbidden to take the loan, and spend it unnecessarily,
and possibly lose it, and thus the lender will be unable to collect it. This
applies even if the lender is very wealthy. One who does this is called a
wicked person, as it is said, ""The wicked borrow and do not repay.""
The Sages have commanded: ""Your friend's property should be as dear
to you as your own."" If the lender recognizes that the borrower has this
character, that he has no consideration for other people's property, it is
better not to lend him, than to lend him and be compelled to press him





later, thereby violating on each occasion the precept, ""You shall not be
to him like a creditor.""
7

If you lend money on a security, you must refrain from using the
security, for this is like taking interest. If you lend a poor man money
on [the security of ] a shovel, or on an axe, or a similar thing, which can
be rented out at a good fee, and is only slightly depreciated by use, you
may rent it out without obtaining the owner's permission, and deduct
the proceeds from the debt, as it may be assumed that the borrower
would agree to it. Some Poskim say you may rent out these articles only
to others, but not to yourself, lest you be suspected of using them free
of charge merely because of the loan.

8

If the lender wants to take a security from the borrower, after the loan
had been made, he should not do so by himself, but rather through Beis
Din.

9

You should avoid becoming a guarantor, or a trustee whenever possible.

10

If you hold a note of indebtedness against your friend, and the
document is worn out, and its script is fading you should go to a Beis
Din and have it certified.

11

It is forbidden to keep a paid note in your possession, for it is said, ""Do
not let unrighteousness dwell in your tents.""

12

Just as you must be careful to guard a deposited article, you must be
careful to guard the security even more so; because you are like a paid
watchman of the article. And just as a trustee is not permitted to give
the article to another person to watch, as will be explained in chapter





188, so is the lender not permitted to deposit the security with
someone else, or to give it as a security without the consent of the
owner.
13

If you lend money to your friend on a security on condition that if he
does not repay the loan at a certain date, he will forfeit the security,
then you must be sure to tell the borrower when the loan is made, ""If
you do not redeem the security by such and such a date, it shall become
mine retroactive to the present time.""

14

If you know you owe your friend money, and your friend says to you: ""I
am certain you owe me nothing,"" you need not pay him, because he
has apparently forgiven the debt.

15

When a borrower chooses to repay the lender via a messenger, as soon
as he gives the money to the messenger, the messenger acquires the
money for the lender. Thereafter, if the borrower has regrets, and wishes
to take back the money from the messenger, and repay the loan later, he
is forbidden to do so; because this is borrowing without the owner's
knowledge. The messenger is equally forbidden to return the money to
the borrower.

Most Poskim [halachic authorities] agree that the cancellation of debts
on the shemitah year, is effective even in our time, and even in lands
outside Eretz Yisroel. The general public is lenient about this, and have
been censured on this account by the great Torah scholars of Yisrael, of
blessed memory. A few of them have tried to justify this [lax] custom by





relying on a few [authorities] who are lenient about this. However, a
person who wishes to observe mitzvos meticulously is certainly
obligated to follow the opinion of the majority of poskim of blessed
memory. Particularly so, when the problem can be solved by means of
the prosbol, (see paragraph 15) without any monetary loss. The last
Sabbatical Year was in 5635, and will occur, God willing, in the year
5642.
2

The Sabbatical Year (shemitah) cancels every type of loan, whether it is
an oral loan, or on a note, or even on a property mortgage. If you gave
your friend money, as a business partnership, (described in Chapter
66), whereby half of it is a loan and the other half is a deposit, the half
that is considered a loan is cancelled, but the half that is a deposit is not
cancelled.

3

If you lend someone on the security of a pledge [collateral], it is not
cancelled (on shemitah); but if you lent him on the security of real
estate, there are various halachic opinions regarding the cancellation of
the debt.

4

If a guarantor paid the lender, and before the borrower had paid the
guarantor, the Sabbatical Year intervened, shemitah cancels this debt.

5

If someone is obliged to another, [to take] an oath concerning a
monetary claim, and if he were to admit his liability, the shemitah
would cancel his debt, then shemitah cancels the oath as well.

6

If a man owes someone money and denies it, (and as a result) the claim
was presented to Beis Din and he was charged, once the Beis Din





recorded the verdict, and gave it to the lender, the shemitah does not
cancel this debt.
7

If you lend money to someone on condition that shemitah will not
cancel the debt, even so, shemitah cancels it. However, if a condition
was made that the borrower shall not cancel this debt, even if this is
during the shemitah year, it does not cancel it. Also, if the note was
written with reference as a deposit, shemitah does not cancel this debt.

8

If you lend money to someone for a certain number of years, and the
debt is due after the shemitah year, the debt is not cancelled, because
you were unable to demand payment earlier.

9

If you present your notes of indebtedness to Beis Din and say to them:
""Collect my debts for me,"" they are not cancelled in the shemitah year.

10

If you sell something to someone on credit, the money is considered a
loan and shemitah cancels it. However, a storekeeper who sells to people
on credit, and it is not his custom to demand payment until a certain
amount accumulates, these debts are not cancelled. If, however, he
charged them as a loan, that is, he totalled all the items, and entered the
sum total in his ledger, then it is considered a loan, and shemitah
cancels it.

11

The wages of a laborer are not cancelled, but if they were converted
into a loan, they are cancelled by shemitah.

12

Claims acquired from a non-Jew are treated as claims of a non-Jew.
Therefore, if you purchase a note of indebtedness from a non-Jew,
against a Jew, shemitah does not cancel it, for the non-Jew was able to





collect with his note under all circumstances. Also, if one has become a
guarantor to a non-Jew, on behalf of a Jew, and the Jew failed to pay his
debt, so that the Jewish guarantor had to pay the non-Jew, and thus
took the note that the non-Jew held against the borrower, shemitah does
not cancel this note. However, if there is no note, but the guarantor
sues the borrower orally, because he had to pay the non-Jew for him;
then the borrower is exempt from payment.
13

Shemitah cancels monetary loans only at the end of the shemitah year.
Therefore, if you lend someone money during the shemitah year, you
may collect the debt during the entire year, but at sunset the eve of Rosh
Hashana, the debt is cancelled.

14

If a borrower comes to pay his debt to the lender after the shemitah had
passed, the lender should say to him: ""I have cancelled your debt, and
you are released from my claims."" If the borrower says: ""Even so, I want
you to accept the money,"" the lender is permitted to accept it.
However, the borrower should not say, ""I am paying this on the
account of my debt;"" rather, he should say to him: ""The money is
mine, and I am giving it to you as a gift."" The lender is [even]
permitted to make an effort to persuade the borrower to say ""I am
giving you the money as a gift."" However, if he is unable to [persuade
him] he may not accept the money from him.

15

If there is a prosbol, shemitah does not cancel the debt. What is a prosbol
and how is it obtained? The lender goes before three men, learned in
Torah, who constitute a Beis Din. He says to them: ""To you judges, I
hand over all the claims I have against so and so, etc. so that I am able
to collect these debts whenever I desire."" They then write for him a





prosbol which reads: ""We were sitting together, as three [judges], and soand-so the lender came and said in our presence, ""I hand over etc."" All
three judges sign at the bottom of the document, either as judges or as
witnesses. This can also be done at the end of the year, that is, on the
eve of Rosh Hashana before sunset. Some Poskim say it is not necessary
to write the prosbol, but it is sufficient if he declares this before the Beis
Din. Even if there is no Beis Din in your town, you can declare: ""I hand
over my notes to the Beis Din which is in such and such a place.
16

The prosbol is of no avail unless the borrower possesses some real estate,
be it ever so small; even if he has only a flower pot with a hole in the
bottom, it is sufficient. Even if the borrower has none, but the
guarantor has some real estate, or someone who is indebted to the
borrower has some, this too is sufficient. If none of these people possess
any real estate, and the lender possesses some real estate, be it ever so
small, he may transfer it to the borrower, even through a third party,
and even in the borrower's absence, and this is sufficient to validate the
prosbol.

When there is a controversy between two persons, it is best for them to
agree to an acceptable compromise, with each side yielding somewhat,
in order to avoid the humiliation of a lawsuit. They should make every
effort to do so.

2

If it is impossible for them to reach an acceptable compromise, and
they are forced to go to court, they should go before a Jewish Beis Din.
It is forbidden to bring a suit before secular judges, and in their courts;





even if their decision would be in accordance with the Torah law. Even
if both litigants are willing to bring the case before them, it is forbidden
to do so. Even if they had made a binding agreement, or they had a
written agreement to that effect, it is of no avail. Whoever brings a case
before them is a wicked person, and it is considered as if he had
insulted, blasphemed, and rebelled against the Torah of Moshe
Rabbeinu, peace be on him. Even in a case where a man is permitted to
take the law into his own hands, as will be explained, God willing, in
paragraph 9, it is forbidden to do so through non-Jews. Even if he does
not bring the case before a secular tribunal, but uses non-Jews to force
his opponent to go with him to a Jewish court, he deserves to be
flogged.
3

When the defendant is a difficult person, and you live in a society
governed by non-Jews; you should first summon him to appear in Beis
Din. If he refuses to go, you may obtain the consent of Beis Din, and
save your property in the secular courts.

4

If you are sued on a monetary claim, that you really owe, it is forbidden
to seek ways of evasion, in order to force the creditor to compromise,
and forgo the remainder of the debt. If you transgressed and did so, you
are not discharged of your obligation before the judgement of Heaven,
until you pay the claimant what is rightfully his.

5

A litigant is forbidden to present his case to the judge in the absence of
his opponent. Therefore, one litigant should not present himself to the
judge before the other, lest he be suspected of coming early in order to
present his case in the absence of his opponent.




6


Just as the judge who accepts a bribe, even to acquit the innocent,
transgresses a negative precept, so does he who offers the bribe
transgress the negative precept, ""You shall not put a stumbling block
before the blind.""

7

It is forbidden to enter a false plea. Even if you know you have a just
claim, and if you tell the truth, the judgement will be against you,
nevertheless, you may not enter a false plea. This is stated in the
Talmud: ""Our Rabbis have taught, from where do we know that one
who has lent his friend one hundred shekalim, should not say I will
claim two hundred, so that when he admits to owing one hundred, he
will be obliged to take an oath, and then I will force him to take an
oath with regard to some other matter? We learn it from the verse:
""Keep far away from anything false."" From where do we know that if
one has a claim against another for one hundred shekalim, but demands
two hundred shekalim, that the borrower should not say, I will deny the
whole claim in Beis Din, and will admit (to one hundred) out of Beis
Din, in order not to be obliged to take an oath, and to prevent him
from making me take an oath as regards some other matter? We learn it
from the verse: ""Keep far away from anything false."" From where do we
know that if three people have a claim of one hundred shekalim against
one person, that one of them must not be the plaintiff and the other
appear as witnesses, in order to obtain the one hundred shekalim, and
divide it among themselves? We learn from the verse: ""Keep far away
from anything false.""

8

Occasionally, the litigants choose men [arbitrators] to effect a
compromise between them, either jointly with the Beis Din, or without





Beis Din. This is a proper procedure, because each [arbitrator] promotes
the cause of the one who has chosen him, and thus a just settlement
will be reached. But the arbitration must be conducted in a just
manner, [and not] Heaven forbid pervert the process of compromise.
For just as we are commanded not to pervert judgement, so, too, we are
commanded not to pervert the process of compromise.
9

A man may [sometimes] take the law into his own hands. If you see an
article of yours in the possession of someone who had robbed it, you
may take it away from him. If the latter tries to stop you, you may even
strike him until he releases it, if you are unable to get it by other means.
You may do so even if it is an article that will not depreciate if you wait
until you summon him to Beis Din. If there are witnesses who [will] see
you seize the article from this other's possession, you may not seize it by
forceful means, unless you will be able to verify later that you took what
is yours. For if you are unable to prove your ownership, your seizure is
of no avail since there are witnesses that you took it by force. However,
if there are no witnesses, whereby the seizure will be effective, you may
seize it forcefully even though you will be unable to verify your
ownership.

10

When the people of a city appoint a Beis Din for the community, they
must ascertain that each one of the judges possesses the following seven
qualities: wisdom in Torah, humility, fear of God, abhorence of money
—even their own, love of truth, loved by their fellow men, and a
reputation for good deeds. Whoever appoints a judge who is unfit for
the position, transgresses a negative precept, as it is said, ""You shall not
respect persons in judgement."" This means, you shall not favor anyone
and say, ""So-and-so is wealthy, or is my relative, I will appoint him as a





judge."" It is forbidden to rise before a judge who was appointed
through the influence of money, or to show him any other honor. With
reference to such a person, our Rabbis, of blessed memory, applied the
verse: ""Gods of silver and gods of gold you shall not make for
yourselves.""
11

In communities where there are no scholars who are qualified to be
judges, they should appoint the best and wisest among themselves
according to the understanding of the townsmen, and they should
judge even though they are not qualified to be judges. We permit this
so that people will not go to the secular courts. Since they were
accepted by their townsmen, no one can disqualify them. All their
activities should be for the glory of Heaven.

12

If you are able to bear witness for your neighbor and are qualified to
testify, and your neighbor would benefit from your testimony, and asks
you to testify on his behalf in the presence of Beis Din, you are obliged
to testify, whether there is another witness besides you or you are the
only one. If you withhold such testimony, you will have to answer to
the Heavenly Court. It is forbidden to testify about anything you do
not know (firsthand), and not even if the man who told you is someone
you are certain that tells no lies. Even if the litigant says to you, ""Come
and stand next to the one witness that I have, not to testify, but just to
intimidate my debtor, so he will think that I have two witnesses, and he
will consequently admit (his obligation to me),"" you must not listen to
him, as it is said, ""Keep far away from anything false.""

13

The law that states that the testimony of one witness is valid, is only
when money matters are involved; for then, the testimony of even one





witness is sufficient to require the administration of an oath. Similarly,
with regard to a sinful act, if the prohibition was not yet violated, the
singular witness may testify in order to prevent him from sinning.
However, if the sinful act had already been committed one witness
should not testify to it; since one witness is not believed, he will only be
spreading an evil report about another person.
14

If you accept a reward for your testimony, your testimony is null and
void. This is true only after you had already witnessed the facts, for
then it is your duty to testify free of charge. However, (if you are asked)
to witness a certain transaction in order to subsequently testify, you are
permitted to take compensation. It is permitted to take compensation
only to the extent that you were inconvenienced and no more. Also, if
it is an inconvenience for you to go to Beis Din, you are entitled to
compensation for your inconvenience, but only to the extent that it is
proper for this inconvenience, and no more.

15

Any testimony from which you derive benefit, or in which you have a
personal interest, even if remote, disqualifies you as a witness.

16

It is written, ""And that which is not good, he did among his people.""
This is homiletically interpreted to refer to a person who comes with
power of attorney, and argues about a quarrel that is not his. This
applies only when both litigants are in town, but the borrower is a
strong man, and a good pleader, and the lender fears the confrontation
with him, and thus gives power of attorney to someone else. This is the
case of someone arguing about a quarrel that is not his. However, if the
defendant is in another city, and the plaintiff cannot trouble himself (to
go personally), and gives someone the power of attorney, then the latter





is doing a meritorious deed in rescuing the wronged person from the
hand of the one exploiting him. Some Poskim maintain that if you
accept a power of attorney in order to receive a fee, and not because you
are a quarrelsome person, it is permitted.
17

You should distance yourself from taking an oath, even if it is a truthful
one. You should make every effort to refrain from it.

18

If your opponent is obliged to you for an oath, and you realize that he
is prepared to swear falsely, Heaven forbid, you should reach the best
possible compromise with him, and not permit him to swear falsely, for
it is said, ""an oath to Adonoy shall be between them."" And this is
expounded to teach, that [the punishment of ] the oath rests on both of
them.

19

If a Jew knows of evidence that favors a Gentile who has a lawsuit with
a Jew in the secular courts, and his testimony will cause his fellow Jew
to be liable for a larger amount than he would have been liable to
according to Jewish law, he is forbidden to testify for him; but if not, he
is permitted to testify for him. If initially the Gentile arranged for the
Jew to testify for him, since the Name of God will be desecrated if he
does not testify (as he had agreed to), he should testify under all
circumstances.

20

So long as you remember the facts, you may testify at any time and you
need not fear that because it happened long ago, you do not remember
clearly. Even if you only remember the testimony from the record you
made. If for example when they gave you [a document etc.] you wrote
the information in your book, in order to have a record of it, and you





had forgotten the facts and only remember them from your records,
even in such an event you may testify. This is true only if upon reading
the records, your memory is refreshed. Also, if your memory is
refreshed by someone else who reminded you, you may testify; even if
the one who reminded you is the second witness. However, if the
litigant himself reminded you and refreshed your memory, you may not
testify. The litigant, however, may present the facts to someone else,
and that person may in turn remind you, for then your memory will
have been refreshed by a third party.
21

A witness who is related to one of the litigants, or to one of the judges;
or witnesses who are related to one another, even if the relationship is
on their wives side, may sometimes be disqualified to testify. Even if
they are related only to the guarantor, and not to the borrower, they are
also disqualifed from testifying on behalf of the borrower. The Torah
has disqualified the testimony of relatives, not because of the love they
have for one another, for they are disqualified to testify whether it is in
his favor or against him; but rather, it is a Divine decree. Even Moses
and Aaron were not qualified to testify for one another. Therefore, any
witness who is related to any one of the above mentioned individuals,
or was once related, but the relationship no longer exists—should the
judges be unaware of the situation, the witness must inform them, and
they will tell him if in accordance with Torah law, the relationship is
significant enough to disqualify him, or not.

22

If there are two witnesses and one of them knows that the other is a
sinful man, and is not qualified to testify according to the law of the
Torah, and the judges are unaware of his wickedness, it is forbidden to
testify with him, even though the testimony is true, for it is said: ""Do





not join your hand with a wicked man to be a corrupt witness. It is a
Divine decree that the entire testimony be invalidated even if there are
many witnesses, should one of them be disqualified to testify. Who is
considered sinful enough to be disqualified as a witness by decree of the
Torah? Whoever transgresses in a matter which has been accepted by
the Jewish people as a sin, and which is a Divine prohibition, that he
violated intentionally and has not (been known to have) repented.
However, if it is possible to assume that he did it unintentionally, or in
ignorance, not being aware of the prohibition, he is not disqualified to
bear testimony.
"
"1

It is forbidden to rob or to steal even an article of trivial value from a
Jew or from a non-Jew. It is recorded in Tanna Devei Eliyohu: It
happened that a man told me [Eliyah] that he had wronged a non-Jew
in measuring dates that he sold to him. Thereafter, he bought oil with
all that money and the jug broke and the oil spilled. I said, ""Blessed is
the Omnipotent that shows no favoritism."" The Torah says, ""Do not
cheat your fellow, nor rob him,"" and robbery of a non-Jew also
constitutes robbery.

2

Taking a thing of such trivial value, that no one would mind, like
taking a splinter from a bundle [of wood], in order to use it as a
toothpick, is permitted. However, it is an act of piousness to refrain
from this as well.




3


Even stealing with the intention of returning it, but just for the sake of
annoying someone, or to tease someone, is also forbidden.

4

It is forbidden to cheat your fellow even in the slightest degree, as it is
said, ""Do not cheat your neighbor."" What is cheating? If your
neighbor's money comes into your possession with his consent; for
example, if he lent you money, or you owe him wages (or rent), and
you do not wish to pay him, or you put him off by saying, ""Go,"" ""and
return [later]."" Since the verse states: your [Jewish] neighbor, it is not
forbidden to do so with a non-Jew. This is true only if this will not
cause the Name of God to be desecrated; for example if you borrowed
from a non-Jew and he died, it is permitted to deny the loan to his son,
because he does not know for sure that you are lying. However, if the
non-Jew knows you are lying, it is forbidden because of the desecration
of God's Name. And even if the son is not sure, it is only permitted to
deny a loan, or any other such debt you owed him. If you have in your
possession an article you received from a non-Jew which is intact, you
are forbidden to deny it, for this constitutes actual robbery. Moreover,
even if you buy something from a non-Jew, you are forbidden to fool
him in counting out the money, as it is said, ""And he shall reckon with
his buyer,"" which refers to a non-Jew. For he is only conveying the
article to you in consideration of the sum agreed upon, and if you fool
him in the payment, it is tantamount to stealing the article, and not
merely denying a debt. Even deception not involving any loss of money
is forbidden in business dealing, as was explained in Chapter 63.
Nevertheless, if the non-Jew makes a mistake, it is permitted to benefit
from it, provided there will be no desecration of God's Name, [for





example] in such a case where he remains unaware of his mistake. It is
best to say to him, ""I am relying on your estimate or your bill.""
5

If you covet the house or the vessels of your neighbor, or anything
which your neighbor has no intention of selling, and you ask his friends
to influence him, or if you, yourself, pressure him until he agrees to sell
it to you, you have violated the injunction, ""You shall not covet."" From
the moment you were tempted, and began to think, how will you
acquire this item, you have violated the command, ""You shall not
desire""; for desire is only in the heart, and desire leads one to covet. If
you ultimately buy that which you had desired, you will have
transgressed two negative commands. That is why it is said, ""You shall
not covet"" and ""You shall not desire.""

6

The robber is enjoined by a positive command, to return the stolen
article if it is in its original state, and has not been altered. As it is said,
""He shall return that which he robbed."" The same law applies to a thief.
This obligation cannot be fulfilled merely with the return of money to
the owner, even when he had already given up hope of getting it back.
However, if the stolen article was lost or altered in such a way that it
cannot be restored to its original state, or it was sunk into a building,
and will cause him a great loss to tear down the building, the obligation
may be fulfilled by paying a sum of money equivalent to its worth at
the time of the robbery. If the victim of the robbery is in another town,
the robber is not required to send the money to him, but he should
notify him to come and get it. If the victim died, the robber must pay
the restitution to his heirs.




7


He who robs the public—such as a shopkeeper who gives a short
measure, or weighs with a short weight, or the like, or a public official
who is lenient towards his relatives, and exacting towards others, or one
who took usury from the public, will find it difficult to repent
adequately. Therefore, he should establish a community service, so that
his victims, too, might benefit from them. Nevertheless, if the identity
of his victims are known to him, he is obligated to make restitution,
and he does not fulfill this obligation merely by contributing to a
public service.

8

It is forbidden to buy from a thief, or a robber, any article that was
stolen or robbed. There is no difference if he is a Jew or a non-Jew, for
the non-Jew is also commanded not to steal or rob even from another
non-Jew; and this is one of the seven precepts which they have been
commanded. It is a serious sin to buy from a thief or a robber, for in
doing so you are abetting evildoers. With reference to this it is said,
""He who is a partner with a thief, hates his own soul,"" and he causes
the thief to commit other acts of stealing; for if he will find no buyer he
will not steal. Although it is possible for the thief to take the stolen
article to a place where he is not known, this course is not always
available to him. If the buyer's intention is for the owner's benefit, in
order to restore it to him, upon payment of the money he advanced, it
is permissible; provided it is impossible for the owner himself to recover
it. It is also forbidden to accept for safekeeping, anything which appears
to be stolen.

9

It is forbidden to derive the slightest benefit from property that was
stolen or robbed while it is in the possession of the thief or robber. Even





a trivial benefit that its owner would not mind, such as exchanging the
money for an equal amount of another denomination is forbidden in
the case of money that was stolen or robbed. It is also forbidden to
enter a stolen house to [protect yourself ] from the hot sun or from the
rain, or to pass through a stolen field.
10

It is forbidden to derive benefit from the possessions of one who is a
known thief or robber, who has no other occupation, and whose entire
property is presumed to have been acquired by theft or robbery, and a
poor man is forbidden to accept charity from him.

11

Similarly, it is forbidden to buy something from someone who wishes
to sell an article that apparently had been stolen as when fruit
watchmen sell fruit in a secluded spot, or when a salesman conceals the
merchandise he is trying to sell, or when he says to the buyer, ""Hide it.""
It is forbidden to buy something from a woman when there is reason to
suspect that she is selling it without her husband's consent, or to buy
women's jewelry or clothing from a man, when there is reason to
suspect that he is selling them without his wife's consent.

12

If you inadvertently exchanged coats at a wedding hall or another
public place, you are not allowed to use these items that came into your
possession, and are not yours. When the rightful owner appears you
must return it to him, even if yours had been lost there. Also, in case a
commercial launderer gave you someone else's garment, you are
forbidden to wear it, but must return it to its rightful owner; even
though yours was lost. However, if the article was with you so long that
it is impossible the owner did not inquire after his things during this





time, then you are permitted to wear it, for you may assume that the
launderer satisfied the owner, and paid him for this garment.
13

It is forbidden to use anything belonging to your fellow without his
knowledge. Even if you are certain that when the owner finds out he
will be happy and elated that you used it, because of his good feelings
towards you; nevertheless it is forbidden. Therefore, if you enter the
orchard or garden belonging to your neighbor, it is forbidden to pluck
fruit without the owner's knowledge, even though the owner of the
orchard and the owner of the garden is truly a dear, cherished friend,
and will certainly be happy and elated when finding out that you
enjoyedhis fruit. Nevertheless, since at the present time he knows
nothing of this, you are enjoying it unlawfully. It is necessary to warn
the public regarding this; for they break this rule for lack of knowledge.

14

However, it is permitted for a member of your household to give a slice
of bread to a poor man, or to the owner's friend's son without his
knowledge, for this is customary among people, and is not considered
as something done without the owner's knowledge since this is
customary, and the owner is aware of this custom. For this reason it is
permitted to accept charity from women, if it is a small contribution,
even without her husband's knowledge, since this is the general custom,
and husbands are aware of this custom. Also, with regard to an orchard,
if you are generally acustomed to eat of its fruit with the owner's
knowledge, you are permitted to do so (even without his knowledge).
And so it is in all similar cases.

15

If you find fruit on the road underneath a tree, that overhangs the road,
if it is the type of fruit that usually falls from the tree, and becomes





spoiled after falling, or even it it does not become spoiled, but most
people who pass by are non-Jews, or if it is the type of fruit that animals
are accustomed to eat, and animals do pass by, [it may be assumed that]
the owner has already abandoned his ownership, and you are permitted
to take them. However, if it is fruit that does not become spoiled by the
fall, and if most of the people passing by are Jews, it is forbidden to take
them because it is considered robbery, If the fruit belongs to minor
orphans, it is forbidden to take it in any case, because minors cannot
waive their rights of ownership.
16

The law of existing government must be recognized as the law (in civil
matters).
"
"1

It is forbidden to damage someone's property even with the intention
of making reparation, just as it is forbidden to steal or to rob with the
intention of making restitution. It is even forbidden to cause damage to
your neighbor, either by deed or by word. For example, if Reuven sold
merchandise to a non-Jew, and Shimon came along and told the nonJew that it is not worth so much money, although it is really true, it is
forbidden to do so. He who indirectly causes damage to his neighbor,
although he is exempt in the court of Beis Din, he is liable in the
(Heavenly Court) until he placates his neighbor.

2

Even if you sustain a loss, you are forbidden to remove the cause of
your damage if by doing so you will cause damage to your neighbor, for
it is forbidden to salvage your property by causing damage to another
even indirectly. However, before the damage is done to you, it is





permitted to forestall it so that it doesn't occur, even though by doing
so, it will cause a loss to your neighbor. For example, if a stream of
water is threatening to flood your field, before the water reaches your
field, you are permitted to construct a dam in its path, even though this
will cause it to flood your neighbor's field. But if the water had already
entered your field, you are forbidden to divert it to your neighbor's
field. For since the damage has already occured, you are not permitted
to divert it from your field, and direct it to your neighbor's field.
3

Also, if an army arrived in town, and the townspeople are obliged to
provide them with room and board, it is forbidden to offer a bribe to
the commanding officer for an exemption; because this will cause a loss
to other Jews. Also, in all cases of taxes, it is forbidden to influence the
officer to exempt you, if by doing so, you make the burden heavier for
others. One who does such a thing is called an informer.

4

It is forbidden to surrender a Jew or his property into the hands of nonJews. [It is also forbidden] whether by deed or by word to inform on [a
Jew] or to divulge his hiding place. Whoever acts as an informer has no
share in the World to Come. Even if the person is an evildoer and a
sinner, it is forbidden to surrender him or his property; even if he
troubles you, and constantly provokes you with words. However, if
someone informed on you, and you cannot save yourself unless you
inform on your informer, you are permitted to do so.

5

It is forbidden to enter the ploughed field of your neighbor because you
will spoil it by trampling upon it.




6


It is forbidden to stand at your neighbor's field, to gaze at it at the time
the crops are standing (ready for harvest), so as not to harm them with
an ""evil eye."" It is certainly forbidden to gaze at someone in a way that
might damage him personally, [as a result] of an ""evil eye."" Even with
regard to his business and occupation where there is no cause to fear an
""evil eye"", if he works in his own house or property, it is forbidden to
watch him without his knowledge, for he may not want others to know
of his business and occupation. It is good manners, when seeing
someone engaged at his work, to bless him and say to him, ""May you
be successful at your task.""

7

Even on your own premises it is forbidden to engage in an activity that
may cause damage to your neighbor. Thus, you must avoid placing in
your yard, near your neighbor's wall, anything that generates heat or
releases warm gasses or vapors, and damages the wall, such as manure
and similar things, unless you keep them at a distance of three tefachim.
You must also keep a distance not to spill water near your neighbor's
wall. Therefore, the (outlet of ) the roof's drain pipe must be kept a
distance of three tefachim from your neighbor's wall. You most certainly
may not spill a pot of urine close to your neighbor's wall. With regard
to urinating close to your neighbor's wall, if the wall is of stone, or of
wood, without plaster, a distance of one tefach is sufficient. If the wall is
of bare rock, you need not distance yourself at all, and may urinate on
the wall itself. If the wall is brick, or of wood covered with plaster, you
must keep a distance of three tefachim.
"
"



1


It is forbidden to strike your fellow Jew, and if you do strike him you
are transgressing a Divine negative command, as it is said, ""If the
wicked man deserves to be beaten etc., he should be given forty stripes,
he shall not exceed, lest he exceed."" If the Torah is concerned not to
strike a wicked person more than prescribed for his evil, all the more so
does this apply to the striking of the righteous. Whoever raises his hand
against another to strike him, even if he does not actually strike him, is
called a rasha (wicked person) as it is said, ""And he said to the rasha:
'Why will you strike your neighbor?'"" It is not said, ""Why have you
struck,"" but ""Why will you strike;"" although he did not actually strike
him, he is called a rasha. Whoever strikes his fellow Jew has been
excommunicated by the early Sages. He can not be counted as one of a
quorum of ten required for the performance of sacred rituals, until Beis
Din releases him from excommunication, upon his acceptance to abide
by their decisions. However, if someone strikes you or a fellow Jew, and
you are unable to save yourself or your fellow Jew from the attacker
unless you strike him, you are permitted to strike him.

2

Even if your servant disobeys you, you are forbidden to strike him.
However, you are permitted to strike your young children, or [even] an
orphan whom you are raising in your home, in order to admonish them
and guide them on the proper way, as this is for their ultimate benefit.

3

You must be careful not to throw pieces of broken glass and the like in
any place where they may cause harm to anyone.

4

If your neighbor suffers from a headache, which may be aggravated by
the noise of hammering, you are forbidden to pound grits even in your





own house, or anything similar to them, should the sound of their
pounding carry to your neighbor's house and cause him harm.
5

There are many more things that are forbidden because they cause
harm to your neighbors, or to the public. The general principle is that
it is forbidden to do anything, even on your own premises, and
especially on a public domain, that may cause damage to your neighbor
or to passers by in a public domain, unless it is generally accepted that
whoever wishes to do this activity may do so. For in such case, it is as if
all the townspeople sanctioned this activity, so that each of them has
the privilege to do so whenever he needs to; he, or his children (etc.).

6

If you frighten someone, such as by suddenly screaming behind him, or
by appearing suddenly before him in the dark, or anything similar, you
will be answerable to the Heavenly court.

7

If you injure your neighbor, although you paid the injured person all
that you owe him for his injury; also a thief or a robber, although he
had returned the article, or made restitution for it, nevertheless, there
cannot be atonement until you seek forgiveness from the injured, or
from the victim for the pain you caused them. They, for their part,
should forgive and not be harsh in refusing.

8

If you see that your neighbor is in trouble, and you are able to save
him, or to hire others to save him, you are obliged to trouble yourself or
to hire others to save him. If he has the money to pay, you may ask him
to repay the money you spent to save him. If he does not have the
money, nevertheless, you may not shirk your duty because of this, and
you must save him at your own expense. If you refuse to do so, you are





guilty of transgressing the negative command, ""Do not stand idly by
when the blood of your neighbor [is in danger]."" Likewise, if you hear
wicked people devising a plot against your fellow Jew, or setting a trap
for him, and you did not reveal it to him, or if you were able to appease
them with money on his behalf, and thereby cause them to discard
their plot, and you did not appease them, and other matters similar to
this, you are guilty of transgressing the negative command, ""Do not
stand idly by when the blood of your neighbor"" is in danger. He who
saves one Jewish life is considered as if he had saved the whole world.
9

A person who is involved in counterfeiting (money) and it is feared he
will jeopardize others, is considered as one who is endangering the lives
of others. He must be warned to give up this activity. If he does not
heed the warning, it is permitted to denounce him to the government,
and to declare that no one else is engaged in this practice aside from
him. Also, if a person is falsely accused because of him [the
counterfeiter], he may tell them, ""I am not involved in this, but so and
so is the only one involved"".

10

It had been the custom for the seven elders of the city to set fines in
cases of injuries, insults, and the like. (However,) they must not do
anything independently of the Beis Din, since in regard to these
matters, there are many diverse laws, and they may not impose a fine
greater than what the halachah imposes. They should also not treat the
dignity of the people lightly.

11

When a woman has severe complications in childbirth, so long as the
fetus is unborn, it may be destroyed, either with medicine or with
instruments; for as long as it is unborn it is not considered a living soul;





and in order to save the [life of the] mother, it is permitted to destroy
it; for it is like someone attempting to take the life of another. However,
as soon as its head protrudes, it must not be touched, for one life is not
to be sacrificed to save another, and this is the way of nature.

If you borrow or rent an animal or other articles from your neighbor,
you are not permitted to lend them or rent them to another party
without the consent of the owner. Even in the case of sacred books, the
lending of which is a meritorious act, we do not assume that the owner
would want to have a mitzvah done with his property, for it is possible
he does not want his property in the possession of someone who may
not be trustworthy in his eyes. However, if you borrow a book, you
may allow someone else to study from it in your house, provided he
studies from it alone and not two [of you] together. If it is known that
the owner is accustomed to trust this other party in such matters, the
borrower is permitted to lend it to him, and the renter is permitted to
rent it to him.

2

It is a mitzvah to pay the wages of a hired workman on time, and if you
delay such payment, you are transgressing a negative commandment, as
it is said, ""On the same day you shall give him his wages, and the sun
shall not go down on it."" It is also a mitzvah to pay for the hire of an
animal or a utensil at the proper time, and if you delay such payment,
you are transgressing a negative command, as it is said ""You shall not
oppress a hired worker who is poor and needy etc., in the same day you
must give his wage."" What is the proper time? If he finished his work





during the day, he should be paid before the end of that day. If the day
has passed and you still did not pay him, you are transgressing the
mitzvah of ""In the same day you should give him his wage, and the sun
shall not go down on it."" If he finished his work during the evening, he
should be paid during that night. If the night passed and you had not
paid him, you are transgressing the negative command, ""The wages of
your worker shall not abide with you (all the night) until the morning.""
Similarly, a workman who is hired by the week, or month, or year, if he
has finished his work during the day, he should be paid during that day;
if he finished during the night, he should be paid during that night and
not later.
3

Also, if you gave your garment to a tailor to repair, for a set price, and
the tailor returns it to you during the day, you must pay him during
that day. And if he returned it to you at night, you must pay him
during that night. However, so long as the garment remains with the
tailor, although the garment is finished, and the work has been
completed, you are not in violation of the law, even if it is in the tailor's
possession for many days, and even if the tailor has notified you to
bring the money and take the garment nevertheless, you are not in
violation of the law.

4

You have not transgressed the law of: ""The wages of your worker shall
not abide with you"" [or the law of ] ""That the sun shall not go down on
it,"" unless the worker demands his wages, and you have the money to
pay him. But if the worker did not demand his wages, or he demanded
his wages but you do not have the money, you are not in violation of
the law. Nevertheless, a scrupulous person will borrow money to pay his
worker in the proper time, for he is poor and sets his heart upon his





wage. If your system is not to pay the workers until after a certain sum
is due, even if they demand a small sum, which they have undoubtedly
already earned, nevertheless, (if you refuse to give it to them), you are
not guilty of transgressing the law, since it is known that this is your
system of payment, and on such condition they hired themselves out to
you.
5

If a hired workman was working for you, and spoiled the article on
which he had worked, even if it was caused by his negligence, in a
manner in which he is legally bound to make reparation, it is a mitzvah
for you to waive your legal rights, and release him from liability, as it is
said: ""That you may walk in the way of good men."" If the worker is a
poor man, and has no food, it is a mitzvah to give him his wages, as it is
said, ""And keep the paths of the righteous."" and the path of the
righteous is to keep the way of Hashem, to practice charity and justice,
to an even greater degree than is required by law.

6

Just as the employer is admonished not to rob the worker of his wages,
and not to delay payment, so is the worker admonished not to cheat his
employer by wasting time at work. He must work with all his strength
[ability,] as our father, Jacob, peace unto him, said, ""That I served your
father with all my strength."" Therefore, a worker is not permitted to
work all night, and hire himself out during the day because he has been
weakened by the night work. Similarly, it is not permitted to work your
animal at night and hire it out for work during the day. A worker is not
permitted to starve or afflict himself, for this weakens his physical
strength, and he will not be able to do the work for his employer
properly. This law applies also to a teacher. (see Chapter 165:12)

Anyone who prevents an animal from eating while working is liable to
be punished by flogging as it is said, ""You shall not muzzle the ox when
it is threshing."" It is immaterial whether it is an ox, or any other animal
or beast, whether unclean or clean, whether it is threshing or any other
work concerned with produce of the ground. The Torah mentions the
ox and threshing only because it speaks of the usual circumstance. Even
if it is muzzled by voice, that is, it is shouted at, and is thus prevented
from eating, it is punishable by flogging.

2

A Jew who threshes (grain) even with an animal belonging to a nonJew, and even if the grain belongs to a non-Jew, transgresses the
commandment ""You shall not muzzle.""

3

If the animal is unable to eat because it is thirsty, you must give it to
drink.

4

If an animal is working with something which would be harmful to its
intestines, you are permitted to muzzle it; for the Torah is concerned
with the benefit of the animal, and in such case it would not be to its
benefit.
"
"1

If you see an article that was lost by a Jew, it is your duty to care for it,
and return it to its owner, as it is said, ""You shall surely return them.""
Similarly, any of your neighbor's property, that you are able to save





from destruction, you are obliged to do so, for this is included in the
mitzvah of returning a lost article.
2

Although according to halachah, in a place where the majority of the
people are non-Jewish, even if the Jew identifies it you are not obliged
to return it to him, because we assume he already had despaired of its
recovery, nevertheless, it is good and proper to do more than the
halachah requires, and return it to the Jew who identifies it; and we
force him to do this. If the finder is a poor man, and the owner of the
article is wealthy, the finder is not obligated to do more than the
halachah requires. In a place where you are required by civil law to
return a lost article, you must return it in all circumstances.

3

If you find an article regardless if it has an identification mark or not, if
upon finding it, it was apparent that it had been placed there, such as a
garment or an ax, that was left at the side of a fence; and even if it is
doubtful whether they were purposely placed there, or lost there, it is
forbidden to touch them.

4

If an old, respected man finds a lost article, that it is so shabby that
even if it were his own, he would not carry it home, because it would
be disgraceful to him, he is not obligated to bother with it. He should,
nevertheless, do more than the halachah requires, and bother with it,
even though it is beneath his dignity.

5

If you find an article and you do not know who lost it, whether it has a
mark of identification, or does not have a mark of identification, these
matters involve many divergent laws, and you should consult a Rav as
to what you should do.




"
"1

If you deposit money with your neighbor, since most of us are involved
in business, and we always need money, it is assumed that you agree
that the depositary may use that money if he needs it. Therefore, the
despositary is permitted to use the money, and the money is considered
by him as a loan, unless you indicate to him that you do not wish it to
be used. For instance, if you put the money in a sealed package, or tied
it up with a special knot, the depositary is not permitted to use it.

2

If someone deposits an article with you, you are forbidden to use that
article for your own needs even though the article will not spoil in the
least by such use. Nevertheless, you would be borrowing it without the
owner's knowledge, and he who borrows without the owner's
knowledge is considered a robber. If you know definitely that your
depositer would not object to your using it, you are permitted to use it.
Some Poskim prohibit this too, because with regard to a deposit, it is
forbidden to use even something whose use people generally do not
object to, because it is considered a fraudulent use of a deposit even in
such circumstances. You should follow the stricter opinion.

3

It is your duty to safeguard the deposit in the most effective manner, in
accordance with the accepted manner of safeguarding such articles.
Even though you are not so particular to guard your own property so
carefully, nevertheless with property entrusted to you, you must take
special care.




4


You are not permitted to entrust the deposit with other people, even
though they are more fit and trustworthy than yourself, unless the
depositor is also accustomed to entrust these kinds of things with them.

5

When you return the deposit, you should not return it to any member
of the depositor's household without his consent. This is also true when
you return any article that was lent to you, or when you pay a debt.
However, you may return it to his wife, as it may be assumed that she
manages the household, and her husband entrusts everything with her.
"
"1

If you meet your neighbor on the road and his animal is lying
underneath its load, whether its burden was a proper load for it, or it
was burdened with a load that was too heavy for it, it is a mitzvah to
assist him to unload the burden, as it is said, ""You shall surely help
him."" After you have helped unload the burden, you should not leave
your neighbor in distress, and go on your way, but you should help him
reload it, as it is said, ""You shall surely help him lift it up again."" If you
leave your neighbor, and did not help him in unloading and loading,
you have neglected to perform an affirmative command, and have
transgressed a negative command, as it is said, ""You shall not see the
donkey of your neighbor [or his ox fallen down by the way and conceal
yourself.]""

2

If after you helped to unload and reload, the animal fell down again,
you must help unload and reload again, even a hundred times, as it is
said, ""You shall surely help"" (and) ""You shall surely help him lift it up.""





Therefore, you must go with him a distance of a parsah, as he might
need your help again, unless the owner of the load tells you, ""I no
longer need your help.""
3

The unloading must be done gratis, but you are not obliged to reload
unless he is willing to compensate you and he must also compensate
you for accompanying him.

4

If the animal belongs to a non-Jew, and the non-Jew was driving the
animal, whether the load belongs to a Jew, or it belongs to a non-Jew,
you are only obliged to help unload because of the suffering of the
animal, and you may receive compensation for it. But you are not at all
obliged to help him reload, unless it would cause animosity. If the nonJew is not present, and a Jew drives the animal, you must also help him
reload, because of the distress to the Jew. If the animal belongs to a Jew
and the load belongs to a non-Jew, you are obliged to help unload and
reload because of the distress of the Jew.

5

It is written, ""If you see the donkey of your enemy lying under its
burden,"" etc. This ""enemy"" does not refer to a non-Jew. (They are not
included in the command regarding loading and unloading, unless the
animal suffers), but it refers to a Jew. And how can one Jew hate
another Jew since the Torah states, ""You shall not hate your brother in
your heart""? The Sages said: ""For instance: if you actually saw him
transgress a law, and warned him against it, and he did not desist, it is a
mitzvah to hate him until he repents, and abandons his wickedness.
Even though he has not yet repented, if you find him in distress on the
account of his load, it is a mitzvah to help him unload and reload, and
not leave him without help, for he may stay there out of concern for his





money and may endanger his life."" The Torah is concerned regarding
Jewish lives, whether they are wicked or righteous, so long as they
cleave to Hashem, and believe in the principal tenets of our religion, as
it is said, ""Say to them: as I live says Hashem Elokim, I do not desire the
death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live.""
6

If a group was traveling together, and it happened to one of them that
the legs of his donkey became lame, the other members of the group are
not permitted to depart with their donkeys and leave him alone on the
road. However, if his donkey fell down, and is unable to continue the
journey, they are permitted to leave him, and need not tarry for his sake
longer than is reasonable. Also, a group traveling in vehicles, if one of
them broke down, and requires a short time to repair, the rest of the
group are not permitted to depart from him, unless they would be
detained beyond a reasonable amount of time.
"
"1

It is an affirmative mitzvah to make a fence around the rooftop of your
house, as it is said, ""And you shall make a fence for your roof."" The
height of the fence must not be less than ten tefachim [high], and it
should be so strong that if a man leans against it, it will not fall. The
roofs of our houses, which we do not use, are exempt from this law.
Indeed, not only rooftops require a fence, but any place where there is
danger that a person could meet a fatal accident must have a fence and
or other protection. Anyone who leaves it without a fence violates an
affirmative precept and transgresses a negative precept, as it is said,
""You shall not bring blood upon your house."" For instance, if there is a
hole (well) in your property, you are obligated to make a fence around





it, [that is at least] ten tefachim high, or you must cover it so that no
one will fall in to it.
2

Similarly, it is a mitzvah to remove any obstacle that represents a
possible danger to life. You must also take care to protect yourself from
it, as it is said, ""Preserve yourself, and preserve your soul (life)
diligently."" If you neglect and do not remove potentially dangerous
objects, you will have violated the affirmative mitzvah, and transgressed
the negative command, ""You shall not bring blood upon your house.""
This is applicable if you allow a broken ladder to remain in your house
or property, or if you keep a vicious dog.

3

Just as you must guard your body, and not allow it to deteriorate, to be
damaged or to be injured, as it is said, ""Preserve (guard) yourself, and
preserve your soul (life) diligently;"" so, too, you must guard your
property against destruction, ruin, or damage. Anyone who breaks a
vessel, tears a garment, or destroys food or drink, or pollutes them, or
throws away money, or spoils anything that is fit for man's enjoyment,
violates a negative precept, as it is said, ""You shall not destroy its trees""
etc.
"
"1

The Torah forbids us to inflict suffering on any living creature. On the
contrary, it is an obligation to remove the suffering of any creature,
even if it is ownerless, and even if it belongs to a non-Jew. However, if
they are troublesome to mankind, or if they are needed for medical
purposes, or for any other purpose, it is permitted even to kill them,
and we disregard their pain; for the Torah permits us to slaughter them.





Therefore, it is permitted to pluck feathers from living geese [to use as a
quill], if you have no other feather [with which to write]. However,
people abstain from doing so because of cruelty.
2

When horses pull a wagon and come to a rough road, or to a steep hill,
and cannot draw it further without help, it is a mitzvah to help, even if
they belong to a non-Jew, because of the suffering of the animals, lest
the non-Jew strike them harshly to force them to pull more than they
are able.

3

It is forbidden to tie the legs of an animal, beast, or fowl, in a manner
that causes them pain.

4

It is forbidden to set a bird on eggs of a different species, for this is
cruelty to animals.

5

It is forbidden to castrate a person, or an animal, beast, or fowl,
whether unclean or clean, whether in Eretz Yisroel or outside of Eretz
Yisroel. Anyone who castrates is punishable by flogging. Even to cause
sterility through medical means to man or to any other male creature, is
forbidden.

6

It is forbidden to tell a non-Jew to castrate our animals. According to
some Poskim, it is forbidden even to sell an animal to a non-Jew, or to
give it to him on condition to share the profits, if it is known that he
will castrate it. Because a non-Jew is also included in the prohibition
against castrating, thus in doing so, the Jew transgresses the precept, not
to place a stumbling block before the blind. However, if the non-Jewish
buyer will not castrate it himself, but will give it to another non-Jew,





for castration, all Poskim permit the transaction, for it is an indirect
stumbling block and is permitted.

Said Rav Yitzchok the son of Rav Yehudah, ""One should always plead
for mercy that he should not get sick, for if one falls sick, he is told,
'Demonstrate your merit and you will be acquitted.'"" Said Mar Ukva,
""From which verse in the Torah is this inferred?"" From the verse, ""Lest
any man fall from (mimenu) there."" From within himself (mimenu) he
must produce evidence; which means, since he has fallen, he must
produce from within himself and from his deeds, evidence of his
merit."" It is also stated in the Talmud, ""If a person has a headache he
should view it as if he were put in chains. If he becomes ill and is
confined to bed, he should view it as if he were placed onto a scaffold,
(a place where capital cases are tried) for trial. Anyone who is placed
onto the scaffold for trial, if he has great advocates, may be saved. But if
he has none, he cannot be saved. These are the advocates of man:
repentance and good deeds. Even if nine hundred and ninety-nine
accuse him, and only one advocate defends him, he is saved, as it is
said, ""If there be for him an angel, an advocate, [even] one among a
thousand, to vouch for man's uprightness, then he is gracious unto
him, and says, 'Redeem him from going down to the pit.'""

2

Rabbi Pinchas, the son of Chama, expounded, ""Anyone who has a sick
person in his house, should go to a Sage and ask him to plead for mercy
on his behalf, as it is said, ""The wrath of a king is like messengers of
death. But a wise man will pacify it."" It is customary to give charity to





the poor on a sick person's behalf, for repentance, prayer, and charity,
avert the evil decree. It is also customary to bless the sick person in the
synagogue, and if he is critically ill, we bless him even on Shabbos and
Yom Tov. At times the name of the sick person is changed, for a change
of name may also nullify the decree.
3

The Torah permits a doctor to heal the sick, as it is said ""And he shall
[pay] to have him healed properly."" Therefore, a sick person should not
rely on a miracle, but is obliged to follow the accepted procedure and
call a physician to heal him. Many of the world's pious men have been
cured by physicians. A person who refrains from calling in a physician
(for himself ) commits two wrongs: For one, it is forbidden to rely on a
miracle in a life-threatening situation. This behavior causes one's sins to
be remembered at a time of illness. Secondly, it is arrogant and
presumptuous to rely on your righteousness that you will be healed in
some miraculous manner. You should call the most competent
physician but with all that, your heart should be turned to Heaven, and
pray for mercy from the Faithful Healer, blessed is His Name trusting
in Him alone.

4

It is a mitzvah for the competent physician to heal and is included in
the mitzvah of saving a life. If he refrains from doing so, he is guilty of
shedding blood, even if the patient has another physician, because not
through every physician does a person merit to be cured, and it is
perhaps Heavenly ordained that he shall be cured through him.
However, one should not practice medicine unless he is an expert and
there is no one more competent than him. For otherwise, he is guilty of
bloodshed.




5


A person who is not critically ill, and can possibly be cured by
permissable medication, is forbidden to take anything that is
prohibited; although he must wait until he can obtain it, we do not
permit him to take anything that is prohibited. If he specifically
requires a prohibited article, if he must eat it in the way it is usually
eaten, he is forbidden to eat it; even if it is only prohibited by
Rabbinical ordinance, since his life is not in danger. However [if it can
be eaten] in a manner by which he will not derive the usual pleasure,
for instance, if a bitter substance is mixed with it, it is permitted. It is
permitted to make a plaster of it or something similar, even if it is
something the enjoyment of which is forbidden by the Torah, with the
exception of kilayei hakerem and meat cooked with milk, which is
forbidden to use even in a manner that it is not usual. These laws apply
so long as no danger to life is involved. Regarding the laws of berachos
upon eating and drinking medication, refer to Chapter 50:5 and
Chapter 61:4. (Regarding the law when a child must eat chametz on
Pesach, see the end of Chapter 117.)

6

Some Poskim say that all things, the enjoyment of which is Rabbinically
prohibited, are permitted to be used for a cure, even for one who is not
critically ill, and even in the manner by which they are regularly
enjoyed, provided he does not eat or drink the forbidden article.

7

A person who is critically ill may use any forbidden article for his cure,
for nothing can stand in the way of saving a life except idolatry, incest,
and murder; for which one must give up his life and not transgress.
Thus man may not cure himself by transgressing these sins.




8


A physician is permitted to let blood, and feel the pulse, or other parts
of a woman even if she is married, and he may feel her vulnerable area,
as is customary with physicians, since he does not do so in a sensual
and immoral manner, but is merely practicing his profession. However,
if his own wife is menstrually unclean, he should be stringent (and
refrain from any of the above), if she is not critically ill and there is
another doctor available who is as competent as he is. (See Chapter
153:14 where it is explained, whether a woman who is menstrually
unclean is permitted to attend her husband when he is sick, or if he
may attend her if she is sick, and see Chapter 143:15 if a son is
permitted to let blood from his father, and similar laws.)

9

In case of abdominal illness, a man may not attend a woman, lest he
will be overcome by desire, since he is healthy [and capable.] But a
woman may attend a man since he is sick [and incapable.]

10

If you possess medication and your neighbor is ill and needs them, you
are forbidden to raise their price unreasonably.
"
"1

When a person is ill it is a mitzvah for everyone to visit him, for we
find that the Holy One, Blessed is He, visits the sick, as our Sages of
blessed memory, explained the verse, ""And God appeared unto him
[Abraham] in the plains of Mamre,"" teaching us that He came to visit
Abraham when he was sick. Relatives and friends who are accustomed
to visit him often, should go to visit him as soon as they hear of his
illness. But casual acquaintances, who are not accustomed to visit him





often, should not visit him immediately, so as not to deter his chances
of recovery by labeling him a a sick person. They should therefore not
visit Him until after three days. If, however, one becomes suddenly ill,
even casual acquaintances should visit at once. Even a great man should
visit a less important person, and even many times a day. The more
often one visits, the more praiseworthy it is, providing it is not
bothersome for the sick person. You should not visit your sick enemy,
nor should you comfort him in his mourning, lest he think that you are
rejoicing at his calamity. However, you may attend his funeral, for there
is no concern that people will say that you are rejoicing at his downfall,
since this is the end of every mortal. (In chapter 207:2 we learn that a
sick person need not rise even before the Nasi, but if he wishes to stand
we do not tell him to remain seated.)
2

When the patient lies on the ground, the visitor may not sit upon a
chair which is more elevated than he is, because the Divine Presence is
above the head of the sick, as it is said, ""Hashem will support him on
the bed of his illness."" But when the patient lies in bed, the visitor may
sit on a chair or a bench.

3

The essence of the mitzvah to visit the sick, is to determine the needs of
the patient to see what has to be done for him, and to make him
comfortable with his friends. You must also bear in mind to pray for
mercy on his behalf. If you visited him and did not pray for his
recovery, you have not fulfilled the mitzvah. Therefore, you should not
visit the sick during the first three hours of the day, because during this
time every sick person has some relief from his illness, and as a result,
you will not be concerned to pray for mercy on his behalf. Nor should
you visit him during the three final hours of the day, for then the illness





becomes more severe, and you might despair of his recovery and will
not pray for mercy on his behalf.
4

When you pray for mercy on his behalf, if you are praying in his
presence, you may pray in any language you wish, for you are, so to
speak, praying before the Divine Presence, Who is at the bedside of the
sick. If, however, you are not praying in his presence, for then the
ministering angels are needed to uplift your prayer, and since they are
not bound [to regard] all languages, you should pray in the Holy
Tongue, and include him among all the sick of Yisrael. For by including
him with the others, your prayer will be more readily heard because of
the collective merit of the many sick ones. You should say to the sick
man, ""May the Almighty have mercy on you, among all the sick of
Yisrael."" On Shabbos you should say, ""This is Shabbos, we are
forbidden to wail, healing is soon to come, His mercy is great, rest in
peace.""

5

The visitors must speak to him with wisdom and intelligence. They
should tell him that words do not determine life, nor do words
determine death. They should tell him to give thought to his affairs and
state whether he has loaned to others or deposited anything with
others, or others with him. You should explain to him that imparting
this information is no reason to fear death

6

He should not bequeath [all] his property to strangers, not even to
charity, and leave his natural heirs with nothing. Whoever does so
should realize that the spirit of the Sages is not content with him. This
applies even if the heirs do not conduct themselves properly. However,
if he also leaves the heirs, enough to provide sufficiently for them, he is





permitted to leave the rest to others. A pious man should not sign as a
witness, and should not give counsel in making a will in which the
natural heirs are disinherited; even when the son who is being
disinherited does not act properly, and the inheritance is left to his
brother who is a Torah scholar, who acts properly; because it is possible
that the worthless son will have good and decent children. Even to give
less to one child and more to the other, is forbidden, according to one
Poseik, and it is proper to heed his opinion. See the end of Chapter 26.
7

If the sick man has young children, or if he has both young and grownup children, or if his wife is pregnant, he should appoint a guardian to
act on behalf of the minor children, until they come of age.

8

If the sick person wants to make a Kinyan in order to confirm his will,
it may be done even on Shabbos. Also, if he wants to send for his
relatives, it is permitted to hire a non-Jew on Shabbos, and to send him
to bring them.

9

If a close relative of the patient dies, he should not be told about it, lest
he become distressed. Even if he becomes aware of it, he should not be
told to tear [his garment], lest it causes him greater anxiety. One should
not cry or lament in his presence, whether the deceased was his relative,
or even someone who was not a member of his family, lest he will fear
that he too is dying. Those who comfort mourners in his presence must
be silenced.

10

A person who has stomach problems should not be visited, because he
may be embarrassed. A person who has an eye ailment, or one who has
a headache, and also one who is critical, and to whom conversation is





difficult, should not be visited personally. Rather you should enter an
outer room and inquire there if he needs anything. You should be
concerned of his pain and pray for mercy on his behalf.
11

If you have two mitzvos to perform, to visit the sick and to comfort a
mourner, if you are able to do both, you should first visit the sick, so
that you will pray for mercy on his behalf. If you cannot do both,
comforting a mourner takes precedence, as this is an act of loving
kindness toward both the living and the dead.

12

A non-Jew may be visited during his illness, for the sake of maintaining
harmonious relationships.

13

It is taught in the Sifrei, Rabbi Nossan says, ""The verse, 'and that
person is guilty, they shall confess,' teaches that all dying persons must
confess."" It is said in the Mishnah, ""Everyone who confesses has a share
in the World to Come, for so we find with Achar, to whom Joshua said,
'My son, please give glory to Adonoy, God of Yisrael, and confess to
Him. Tell me what you have done, do not hide anything from me.'
Achar answered Joshua, and he said, 'Indeed I have sinned against
Adonoy, God of Yisrael, and this is what I have done.' How do we know
his confession atoned for him? As it is said, 'Joshua said, ""Why have
you afficted us? Adonoy will afflict you this day.""' This day you will be
afflicted, but you will not be afflicted in the World to Come.""
Therefore if the visitors notice that the patient is near death, they
should tactfully turn the conversation and say to him, ""Make
confession but don't be disturbed about it, for many have confessed
and have recovered, and are alive, and many who did not confess have
died. As a reward for your confession, you will be granted life, and all





who confess have a share in the World to Come."" If he cannot confess
by word of mouth, he should confess with his heart. If he is able to
speak only a few words, he should be told to say, ""May my death be an
atonement for all my sins."" He should also be told to ask the
forgiveness of all he had wronged, whether in money matters or with
words. None of these words should be said to him in the presence of
the unlearned, or in the presence of women or children, for it may
cause them to weep and thereby break the heart of the sick man.
14

A brief form of confession [is as follows]: I avow unto You Adonoy, my
God, and the God of my fathers, that my recovery as well as my death
are in Your hands. May it be Your will to heal me with a complete
recovery; and if I am to die, may my death be an atonement for all my
sins, iniquities and transgressions which I have sinned, perpetrated and
transgressed before you. Grant me a share in Gan Eiden, and cause me
to merit [the life of ] the World to Come, which is reserved for the
righteous. If he [the sick one] wants to make a lengthy confession, like
the confession of Yom Kippur, he may do so. The forms of confession
are found in the worthy seifer, Maavar Yaabok. The seifer, Chochmas
Adom, has copied the confession form of the Ramban (Nachmanides),
of blessed memory.
"
"1

A person who is very near death is considered as a living being in every
respect. It is, therefore, forbidden to touch him, for anyone who
touches him is considered like one who sheds blood. To what can this
be compared? To a dripping [flickering] candle, which becomes
extinguished as soon as someone touches it. Even if he is critical over a





long period, and he and his family are in great agony, it is, nevertheless,
forbidden to hasten his death in any way. [It is forbidden] for example
to remove a feathered pillow from under him, because some people say
that feathers of certain birds defer death, or for example to place the
keys to the synagogue under his head; all these things are forbidden.
However, if there is something which prevents the departure of the
soul, such as a pounding noise or something similar, it is permitted to
remove it since this is not a direct act, but merely the removal of the
deterrent [to his death], without touching the dying person.
2

Although it is forbidden to touch a dying person, nevertheless, if a fire
breaks out, he should not be left in the house, rather he should be taken
out of the house. His removal takes precedence over the rescue of sacred
books.

3

Those who are attending the dying person, should see to it that no limb
of his projects from his bed, as it is said concerning Jacob, ""And he
gathered up his feet to the bed."" Therefore, they should place chairs at
[the side of ] the bed, so that he cannot extend a hand or foot outside it.
Nevertheless, if this was not done, and his hand or foot was extended, it
is forbidden to touch him in order to put it back.

4

From the moment that his death is imminent, no one is permitted to
leave him, so that his soul does not depart when he is alone, because the
soul is shocked as it departs from the body. It is a mitzvah to stand by a
person, as the soul is departing from him, as it is said, ""Shall he then
live forever, shall he never see the grave? For he sees that wise men die,
etc."" It is proper to gather ten adult males to be present at the departure
of the soul. They must not God forbid engage in idle talk, rather they





should engage in Torah subjects, and in the recitation of Psalms and
other supplication, as arranged in the seifer, Maavar Yabbok. It is
customary to light candles in the presence of a dying person.
5

After the departure of the soul, a light feather is placed at his nostrils. If
it does not move, it is certain that he is dead. The windows should then
be opened, and the mourners should recite the prayer, Tzidduk Ha Din,
(The righteousness of Divine judgement.) When they say the berachah,
Baruch Dayan ha-emes [Blessed is the true Judge], they should include
in it, the Divine Name, (Adonoy Elokeinu) and the mention of His
kingdom, (Melech haolam). [The complete berachah is thus: Baruch
atah Adonoy, Elokeinu, Melech haolam, Dayan ha-emes.] They then tear
their garments, according to the laws stated in the next chapter.

6

All those attending the deceased when the soul departs, must tear their
garments. To what is this [death] compared? To the burning of a Seifer
Torah, for there is no one in Yisrael who is [totally] void of Torah
knowledge and the performance of mitzvos. Even at the death of a child
who studied Scriptures, or at the death of a woman, the garments must
be torn. Even if the deceased had at times committed a sin to satisfy his
lustful desire, the garments must be torn at his death. However if the
person committed a sin regularly, even though he did so only to satisfy
his lustful desire, he is considered among those who have departed from
the ways of the community, and the garments are not torn at his death.
Regarding the tearing of the garments at the death of one for whom
you are not a mourner, and you are tearing your garment only because
you are present at the time of the soul's departure, it is sufficient if you
make a slight tear, even at the side or at the hem.




7


The eyes of the deceased must be closed. If there are sons, it should be
done by his son, as it is said, ""Joseph shall place his hand upon your
eyes."" If there is a firstborn son, he should do it.

8

When lifting the deceased from his bed to lay him on the floor, care
must be taken to keep him covered, for all the customs of modesty that
apply to the living, apply also to the dead

9

It is customary to pour out all the water from the vessels in the vicinity
of the deceased, which is three houses (including the one in which the
deceased lies.) This is done even for an infant who died within thirty
days of its birth. If death occurs on Shabbos the water need not be
poured out. (Birkei Yoseif writes, that one should be stringent and pour
out the water even on Shabbos.)

10

The person who guards the deceased, even if he is not a mourner, is
exempt from Kerias Shema and Shemoneh Esrei, and from all other
mitzvos of the Torah, for he who is engaged in the performance of a
mitzvah is exempt from performing another mitzvah. If there are two
two watchmen, [they should alternate] one of them should guard, while
the other says Krias Shema and Shemoneh Esrei.

11

It is forbidden to eat [a meal] in the room where the deceased lies,
unless there is a partition. It is even forbidden to have a snack, even to
eat fruit or drink water is forbidden. It is necessary to instruct the
guards about this. It is also forbidden to recite a berachah there.

12

It is forbidden to move the deceased on Shabbos, even for the sake of
[vacating the place for] kohanim, or for the sake of performing some





mitzvah. It may be done however by a non-Jews, if the relatives consent
to it.
"
"1

When a person suffers the loss [the death] of one for whom he is
obligated to mourn, he must tear his garments because of it. He must
tear his garments while standing, as it is said, ""And the king arose and
tore his garments."" If he tore his garments while sitting, he has not
fulfilled his obligation, and he must again tear his garments while
standing. Initially he should tear them before the deceased is covered in
the grave, when his sorrow is still intense.

2

For the dead for whom one must observe laws of mourning, the tear in
the garment must be made near the front of the neck. It must be made
from the top, downward, and not in the width of the garment. The tear
must be made in the very cloth of the garment, and not at the seam.

3

There are differences between tearing garments upon the death of a
father or mother, and the tearing of garments upon the death of other
relatives. For all deceased relatives, tearing a tefach of the outer garment
is sufficient, and tearing it more than that is a transgression of, ""You
shall not destroy."" For a father or a mother, all the garments must be
torn that are over against his heart, (see above Chapter 10:3 that the
area of the heart is that which is opposite the bicep of the arm) except
the undershirt which is not torn. Similarly, a garment that is worn only
on occassions, over other garments, and at times one goes out without
it, such as an overcoat, such a garment also does not need to be torn. If





the mourner did not tear all the garments that he was required to tear,
he has not fulfilled his obligation. Because of modesty, a woman should
first tear her inner-garment in private, and turn the tear to the side, and
then tear her outer garment, so as not to expose herself. (Even though
she is covered by her undershirt, nevertheless, it would be immodest to
do otherwise.)
4

Upon the death of other relatives, it is the custom to tear the right side
of the garments, and upon the death of a father or a mother, [it is the
custom] to tear the left side of the garments, because the mourner must
expose his heart, which is on the left side of his body. [However] if it
was done otherwise, it does not invalidate the fulfillment of his duty.

5

When tearing garments for all other deceased, it may be done by hand
or with an instrument, but for a father or mother, it must be done by
hand. It is customary for a member of the Burial Society to make a
slight cut [in the garment] with a knife, and then the mourner takes
hold of the place of the cut, and tears the garment. He must take care
to tear the garment lengthwise and not in the width.

6

For all other relatives, if the mourner changes his garments during the
shivah period, he need not tear the garments, that he is now going to
wear; but for his father or mother, if he changes garments during the
weekdays of the shivah period, he must tear the garments into which he
has changed. However, in honor of Shabbos, he should change
garments, and not wear garments that are torn. If he has no other
garments in which to change, he should turn the torn part backwards
to conceal it. Changing garments for Shabbos in this instance, means





putting on other weekday clothes, but he is forbidden to wear his usual
Shabbos garments.
7

According to halachah, garments that were torn for relatives, may be
stitched together loosely after the shivah, and completely sewn after the
thirty day period. For his father or mother, the mourner may stitch
them together after thirty days, but he may never sew them completely.
Even to cut out the torn part of the garment, and replace it by sewing
in another piece of cloth, is forbidden. The prevailing custom is that
within the thirty day period, even for other relatives, it is forbidden
even to stitch them together loosely. Even to join the torn edges
together with pins is forbidden within the thirty day period. A woman
who is in mourning for her father or mother, may stitch them together
immediately for modesty. All torn garments, which are forbidden to be
sewn, are forbidden to be sewn even if the garments are sold; and
therefore, the seller must inform the buyer. It is forbidden to sell such
garments to a non-Jew.

8

For all relatives who pass away, if one did not hear of their death until
after thirty days, he need not tear his garments. [However] for a father
or mother, the mourner must always tear the garments that he is
wearing at the time he hears of their death. Nevertheless, if he changes
his garments afterwards, he need not tear them.

9

The intervention of a Yom Tov, cancels the thirty day mourning period
even in regard to tearing the garments. Therefore if Yom Tov intervenes
during the thirty days of mourning for other relatives, the mourner may
completely sew up the torn garment after the minchah prayer on the eve





of Yom Tov. If he is in mourning for a father or mother, he may stitch
together the torn garment.
10

If a person tore his garments for the loss of a relative, and another
relative died during the shiva period, he should leave a space of three
finger breadths away from the first tear, and tear another tefach; or he
should extend the originial tear by a tefach. But if the second death
occured after the shivah, so long as he is wearing the torn garment, he
need only extend the tear a bit and this is sufficient. However if the first
death was that of some relative, and the second is that of his father or
mother, then even after the [first] shivah, he must leave a space of three
fingers breadths from the tear, and make a new tear as prescribed by the
halachah, because the death of a father or mother is not considered
merely as an additional sorrow. The same law applies when his father
died first, and then his mother, or vice versa.

11

If a person hears at one time about the death of his father and his
mother, or of the death of two other relatives, he should tear his
garments one time for both of them. But if he hears of the death of his
father or mother together with the death of another relative, he should
first tear his garments for his father or mother, and leave a space of
three finger breadths, and make a new tear for the other relative.

12

When a sick person has lost a relative, if his mind is clear [and he
realizes his loss] but he is unable to tear his garments because of the
seriousness of his illness, he is exempt from tearing his garments after
[his recovery], unless he recovered within the shiva period, which is still
considered a time of intense grief. If, however, he was unable to tear his
garments because his mind was not clear, then when he regains his





clarity of mind and realizes his loss which is then ""his"" time of intense
grief, he must tear his garments if it is within the thirty days of
mourning [for relatives]; but for the death of a parent, there is no time
limit.
13

If a child [a minor] lost a relative, even if the child has not yet reached
the age of chinuch, his garments should be slightly torn for him, to
manifest sorrow and mourning. But if he has already reached the age of
chinuch, it is a mitzvah for him to tear his garments like an adult.

14

When death occurs on Chol Hamoed, it is the custom in these areas, to
tear the garments only for father or mother, whether it is the day of
burial or the day when he heard even delayed news of their death.
However, if his father or mother died on Yom Tov, since the tearing of
the garments had been postponed, he should not tear them on Chol
Hamoed, [but wait] until after Yom Tov when the period of mourning
begins. But for all other relatives, the garments are not torn on Chol
Hamoed, until after the Yom Tov. However, if he heard on Chol
Hamoed, current news of their death, which will become delayed news if
he waits till after Yom Tov, in such an instance, he should tear his
garments on Chol Hamoed.
"
"1

When a person suffers the loss [death] of a relative for whom he is
obligated to observe the ritual mourning, he is considered an onein
until after the burial. An onein must avoid [all kinds of ] levity, lest his
conduct lead people to say that the deceased was a worthless person,
and therefore he is not bothered about his burial, and his mourning,





and is not concerned about his death. This is a tremendous disgrace to
the deceased, and such a person is included among those ""Who ridicule
the poor."" Rather he should manifest to all that he is distressed and
concerned about the deceased and his burial. He should not eat in the
room where the deceased lies, but in another room. If there is no other
room, he should eat in his neighbor's house. If he has no neighbor, he
should put up a partition in front of the deceased, that is at least ten
tefachem high, and the open space below [the partition] should be less
than three tefachim. It should be strong enough to resist the wind. If he
has no material with which to make a partition, he should turn his face
aside and eat. Under all circumstances, and even if he happens to be in
another city, he should not have an elaborate meal, but only a simple
snack, and he must not eat meat or drink wine.
2

An onein is exempt from all mitzvos of the Torah, even if it is not
necessary for him to be occupied with the arrangements for the
deceased, as he has others to do so in his behalf. Even if he wants to be
stringent [and perform mitzvos] he is not permitted to do so, out of
respect to the deceased. He should not say the berachah of Hamotzei on
bread nor recite Birkas Hamazon after eating. Even if others eat and
recite berachos, he should not respond Amein [to their berachos]. He
cannot be included in a quorum of three for Birkas Hamazon, or in
quorum of ten (a minyan) for prayers. However, prohibitory mitzvos,
even those enacted by the Sages, are forbidden even to an onein.
Therefore if he wants to eat bread, he must wash his hands, but he
must not say the berachah, Al Netilas Yadayim, just as he must not say
the Hamotzi. Regarding the washing of hands upon arising in the
morning, he should wash his three times as customary but without
saying the berachah.




3


If the onein had eaten before the burial, and after the burial, the food
was not yet digested, he should say Birkas Hamazon. Similarly, if he had
gone to the toilet before the burial, he should say the berachah, Asher
Yatzar, at anytime during the whole day.

4

If the onein is in another city, and there are relatives in the city where
the dead lies, and they too are obligated to observe the rules of
mourning, then the one who is in the other city, is not considered an
onein. However if there are no relatives where the dead lies, he assumes
all the laws of an onein.

5

In a place where there is a Burial Society, after the relatives have made
arrangements for the burial with the burial society and have come to
terms with them, they have nothing further to do since the members of
the Burial Society will do everthing. Then the relatives are not subject
to the laws of onein, and they are permitted to eat meat and to drink
wine. They are certainly permitted, even obligated, to recite Kerias
Shema and Shemoneh Esrei, and to observe all the mitzvos. Nevertheless,
it is customary for the oneinin not to pray until after the burial, because
they too follow and accompany the deceased to the cemetery. If he [the
onein] wishes to be stringent and pray immediately after handing over
the deceased to the Burial Society, he may be stringent [and do so].

6

So long as the deceased is not buried, the onein does not remove his
shoes, and is permitted to leave the house to make arrangements for the
burial. However, he is forbidden to sit or sleep on a chair or bed. He is
certainly forbidden to have marital relations. He is forbidden to bathe,
to annoint himself, to participate in joyous events, to greet people, to





have his hair cut, and to study Torah. He is forbidden to work, or even
allow others to do work for him, even where a loss is involved. Where
the loss would be substantial, he should consult a Poseik.
7

If a person is an onein, when it is time to recite Krias Shema and
Shemoneh Esrei, and by the time the burial is finished, a fourth of the
day will have passed, (which is the time limit for saying Krias Shema),
he may say Kerias Shema and its berachos without Tefillin until the third
of the day. If a third of the day had passed before the burial he may still
say Kerias Shema, [but] without its berachos. [However] the prayer of
Shemoneh Esrei may be said until midday; and the Musaph service of
Rosh Chodesh may be said even later, for it may be said the entire day.
Of the morning berachos he should say only three: ""Who did not make
me a gentile,"" ""Who did not make me a slave,"" ""Who not make me a
woman."" He should also say the berachos over the Torah as they may be
said the entire day. The other berachos should not be said after their
time has passed, since at the proper time, which is the morning, he was
exempt. If the deceased was buried before a third of the day, and his
house is far away from the cemetery, so that by the time he reaches his
house, a third of the day will have passed, it is best that he should enter
a house near the cemetery, to say Kerias Shema and Shemoneh Esrei, at
the proper time, or he may do so even in the open in a clean place. As
soon as they begin to throw earth on the body, he may recite the Kerias
Shema and Shemoneh Esrei even though the period of mourning has not
yet begun.

8

If the death occured, and he became an onein after the time for the
Shacharis prayers, or after the time for the Mincha or Maariv prayers,
and he had not prayed before he became an onein, and he remained an





onein until after the time of prayer had passed, nevertheless, he need
not make up for them by reciting the Shemoneh Esrei twice in the next
prayer.
9

If death occurs on Shabbos, since it is forbidden to bury him on that
day, the mourner is not restricted by the laws of onein, and is permitted
to eat meat and to drink wine, He must fulfil all the mitzvos, except
that of having marital relations which is forbidden to him. He is also
forbidden to study Torah, because these two are private activities. If he
is the Chazzan of the synagogue, and there is someone else to lead the
prayers, he should not lead the prayers. If there is no one else, he may
lead the prayers. If the deceased is his father or his mother, he may say
the Kaddish, if there are no other mourners, but if there are other
mourners, he should not say Kaddish before the burial. If the onein had
already been in mourning for his father or his mother, or if he was
observing Yahrtseit, he may recite Kaddish, as any other mourner or
Yahrtseit observer.

10

Towards evening (Saturday night) he should say Kerias Shema without
its berachos, but he does not pray Maariv, nor does he recite the
Havdalah for Motzi Shabbos. He is permitted to eat without saying
Havdalah. After the burial, he should say Havdalah with a cup of wine.
Even if the burial is on Sunday, he may say Havdalah with a cup of
wine, but without saying the berachos over the candle and the spices;
because it is permitted to say Havdalah until Tuesday (as stated in
Chapter 96 above). If he prays Shacharis before the time has passed for
saying Havdalah, he need not say ""Attah Chonantanu"" in the Shemneh
Esrei.




11


If towards evening it is necessary for the mourner to walk from his
house to the Shabbos boundary line in order to go immediately after
Shabbos to a place to attend to matters concerning the deceased, or if
towards evening he needs to gather together the officers of the Burial
Society to negotiate the price of the grave, then as soon as begins to
walk and to engage in arrangements in behalf of the deceased, he
becomes an onein.

12

If the death occured erev Shabbos before Minchah, when it was
impossible to bury him before Shabbos, the mourner must even pray
Minchah erev Shabbos.

13

If the death occured on the first day of Yom Tov, and the mourner
wants to bury him on that day using the services of non-Jews, he
immediately becomes subject to the laws of onein. This is certainly true
when death occurs on the second day of Yom Tov, when the mourner
himself is permitted to bury him. He immediately becomes subject to
the laws of onein, even if he does not intend to bury him on that day.

14

If his dead lies before him on the night of the second day of Yom Tov,
when the custom of the community is to bury the deceased using the
services of Jews, the mourner is subject to the laws of onein even at
night. He therefore should not recite Kiddush, nor should he eat meat
or drink wine. However, on the night of the first day of Yom Tov, or
even on the night of the second day of Yom Tov, when the custom of
the community is that even on the second day of Yom Tov, burial is
made only through the services of non-Jews, the mourner is not subject
to the laws of onein at night.




15


If one is an onein at the conclusion of Yom Tov, he may recite Havdalah
on the day after [Yom Tov,] but not after that, because the proper time
for Havdalah after Yom Tov, is only until the end of the day after Yom
Tov.

16

If an onein has a son that must be circumcised, and it is possible to bury
the deceased before the men leave the synagogue after the Shacharis
prayers, those who are involved in the burial should first pray Shacharis,
then bury the deceased, and the child is then circumcised. If that is
impossible, the child should nevertheless be circumcised in the
morning at the synagogue, and the sandeik should say the berachah,
""Lehachniso,"" because circumcision has preference over burial.

17

If a person is an onein on the night of the fourteenth day of Nisan, he
should appoint an agent to search for chametz, but he himself should
recite, ""Kol Chamirah.

18

If a person is an onein on a night when the omer is counted, he should
not count at night, rather on the following day after the burial, he
should count the omer without a berachah. [However], on the following
nights, he may count the omer with a berachah. If he sees during the
day that he will retain the status of an onein until night, he may count
the omer even while he is an onein but without a berachah, so that on
the following nights he may count the omer with a berachah

19

If a man dies in prison, and the warden refuses to release the body for
burial unless he is given a large sum of money, the relatives are not
subject to the laws of onein, nor are they subject to the laws of
mourning, since they have not despaired of being able to bury him and





hope to reach an agreement with the warden. Likewise, if the relatives
of the deceased are in prison, and are unable to tend the needs of the
deceased [burial etc.] they are not subject to the laws of onein.
20

In countries where the law forbids burial of the dead until after fortyeight hours, nevertheless, the onein is still subject to the laws of onein.
Since at the end of the forty-eight hours time limit, they will definitely
bury him, they [the relatives] must in the meantime be occupied in the
honor of the deceased; to prepare shrouds, and a coffin, and to engage
men of the Burial Society. However, on the second day of Yom Tov,
there is a leniency, and they may be exempt from the laws of onein,
since it is impossible to bury the dead [anyway] because of the civil law.

21

In the above mentioned places, since the relatives are concerned that
they may not find men to cleanse the body once forty-eight hours have
passed since the death, and therefore they had the body cleansed
immediately after death, and had it placed in a coffin having holes at
the bottom; then in such a case, as soon as it is placed in the coffin,
they are exempt from the laws of onein, and they begin to observe the
laws of mourning. Nevertheless, they must count the seven days of
mourning from the time the grave is closed.

22

If a death occured, and the relative is unaware of it, if there is no one
else to arrange the burial, he should be told. If there are others to
arrange the burial, he should not be told, until after he has concluded
his prayers. If one's wife lost a relative, and she is unaware of it, the
husband should be strict, and abstain from marital relations with her.
"
"



1


It is a custom of respect to make garments of white linen for shrouds.
They should be made nicely to indicate our belief in the resurrection of
the dead, for Rav Chiya bar Yosef said, ""The righteous will arise with
their garments on them."" However they should not be too elaborate,
for that is forbidden. One should not make the shrouds with a hem, or
a knot of any sort, either when sewing the shrouds or when dressing the
deceased with them. A man should be buried in a tallis with tzitzis
[fringes], but one [of the four tzitzis] should be invalidated. The better
procedure however is to insert one of the tzitzis in a corner pocket of
the tallis when the body is in the grave. If he had a beautiful tallis in
which he prayed during his lifetime, it is not proper to exchange it after
his death with a tallis that is not as beautiful, for a person is desirous of
being buried in the tallis in which he prayed during his lifetime. When
dressing the deceased, they should think: ""Just as his body is being
clothed, so may his soul be attired in spiritial garments in Gan Eiden.""

2

The purification of the body is done in this manner: His entire body
and head is washed with warm water. He should be thoroughly
cleansed between his fingers and toes, as well as all other parts of his
body. His head should be shampooed, his hair should be combed and
trimmed, and his finger and toe nails should be cut (it is not the
custom to do so in our countries). Care should be taken not to place
the deceased with his face downwards as that is disrespectful, rather he
should be inclined on one side, and then on the other side. After he is
thoroughly cleansed, we pour nine kavvim of water over him. This is
done in the following manner: The deceased is placed in a standing
position on the ground, or on straw, and the water is poured on his
head, so that it runs down his entire body.




3


Regarding the capacity of nine kavvim, there are diverse opinions (It is
best to take about twenty four quarts, one liter according to the Polish
measurements.) It is not necessary that all the water be contained in
one vessel; but even two or three vessels can be combined to make up
nine kavvim. It is however necessary that the second vessel be poured
before the first is emptied, and the third one be poured before the
second is emptied. Even when pouring from one vessel, the flow must
not be interrupted. However, four vessels, even if they are poured
simultaneously, cannot be combined.

4

Afterwards, an egg is beaten with wine. The egg is beaten together with
its shell, to symbolize that fortune is like a revolving wheel in the world.
(Where wine is not available water may be used.) The head of the
deceased is washed with this mixture. The custom in some places that
each one takes a little of the mixture and sprinkles it upon the deceased
is improper, and the custom should be abolished because it resembles
the customs of the gentiles. Rather it should be used only to wash his
head.

5

Care should be taken that the fingers of the deceased do not remain
closed. The custom in some places to close his fingers, should be
abolished. The belief of those who say that by doing so, they symbolize
sacred names, is a mere fabrication. Similarly the custom of placing
twigs in his hand generally called forks, is a foolish custom. If they
insist on placing them, they should be put alongside the deceased.

6

After the deceased has been cleansed he should not be left in the place
where the purification took place, but should be placed opposite the





door inside the house. One should not turn over the board upon which
the deceased has been washed, for it may be dangerous to do so.
7

A parent should not kiss his dead children, as it is very dangerous. All
the more so, one should not grasp the hand of the deceased and say
that he should take him along.

8

When the deceased is being taken from the house, care must be
exercised that no one should walk out ahead of him. The pallbearers,
however, who must exit the house first, in order to carry him out, need
not be concerned about this.

9

If a person collapses and dies instantly, if his body was injured, and
blood flowed from the wound, and there is reason to fear that perhaps
his lifeblood was absorbed in his clothes and his shoes, he should not be
ritually cleansed, but he should be buried in his clothing and his shoes.
Over his clothing, he should be wrapped in a sheet. The sheet is called
soveir, (wrapping). It is customary to scoop up the earth from the spot
where he fell, if any blood is there. The earth nearby that spot should
also be dug up, and he should be buried with all the earth that contains
blood. Only the clothing he wore when he fell should be buried with
him, but if the blood splashed on other garments that he was not
wearing at that time, or if he was placed upon pillows and cushions
while still bleeding, these need not be buried but should be thoroughly
washed until no trace of blood remains. The water is then poured into
his grave. If he did not bleed, his clothing should be removed, his body
ritually cleansed, and dressed in shrouds as is done in cases of natural
death. Likewise, the clothing of a person who drowned in water should
be removed, and he should be treated as one who died a natural death.





In some places, it is customary to bury those who drowned with the
clothing in which they were found. Where this is the custom it should
be upheld.
10

Even if blood issued from his body but it stopped, and his clothes were
removed, after which he lived for a few days and died, his body must be
ritually cleansed and dressed in shrouds. Even though his body is
stained from the blood which issued from him, he still must be
cleansed, because we are not concerned [about washing off the blood]
that issued when he was alive. We are concerned only about the blood
which issued from him while he was dying because it may have been his
lifeblood, or that his lifeblood was mixed with it.

11

If a woman dies while giving birth, we apply to her the same law as that
of a slain person, and if it is known that she had lost a great deal of
blood, she is not to be cleansed. If the flow of blood had ceased and she
died later, in which case there is no doubt about lifeblood, she should
be treated as any other person who died naturally. In many
communities, it is the custom to cleanse the body of any woman who
dies at childbirth. There are many other customs pertaining to a
woman who dies at childbirth; where they prevail they should be
observed.

12

One who is murdered by a non-Jew, even if he did not bleed at all, for
example if he was strangled to death, he should be buried as he was
found, in order to arouse wrath against the killer.

13

The deceased, whether gentile or Jew, and his shrouds, are forbidden to
be used for any benefit. Also ornaments of the dead that are attached to





his body, such as a wig that is tied to, or woven into his hair, are
forbidden to be used for any benefit. Also, if he has an artificial tooth,
it should be buried with him, but ornaments that are not attached to
the body are permitted. Also ornaments that are not considered of the
body, such as jewelry and clothing, may be used in any event.
"
"1

If a death occurs in town all the inhabitants are forbidden to do work.
If there are people in the town appointed to take care of the dead, those
whose services are not required, are permitted to work.

2

If a death occurs in a small village, the inhabitants should not exchange
greetings; and certainly one should not extend greetings in a cemetery,
when the deceased is there, awaiting burial. This applies even in a large
city. But if there is no deceased awaiting burial, greetings may be
exchanged at a distance of four amos from the graves.

3

It is forbidden to allow the deceased to remain overnight, as it is said,
""You shall not let it remain etc., but you shall surely bury him the same
day."" To let him remain for his honor, to arrange for a coffin, or
shrouds, or to await the arrival of relatives, or eulogizers, is permitted.
For the Torah forbids delaying the burial only in such a case as when
one is hanged, for it leads to disgrace of the dead, but not when it is for
his honor. Likewise, if a corpse was found and his identity has not been
established, it is permitted to keep the body until witnesses come, or
until his wife comes to identify him.




4


With regard to other relatives who die, the sooner they are brought to
their rest the more praiseworthy it is, but in the case of one's father or
mother whom he is obligated to eulogize and to mourn abundantly, he
who hastens to bring them to rest is despised, unless it is the day before
Shabbos, or the day before Yom Tov, or if it is raining on the coffin.

5

If there are two persons awaiting burial, the one who died first should
be taken out for burial first, and then the second. After burial of the
first one, they should not arrange themselves in rows, nor should they
say the beracha of mourners, or console the mourners, so as not to delay
the burial of the second. If they wish to delay the burial of the first one,
in order to do him honor, the burial of the second should not be
delayed because of him, but he should be buried immediately.

6

If one of the deceased persons is a Torah scholar, and the other is an
ignorant man, the Torah scholar should be taken out for burial first,
even though the ignorant man died first. If there is a man and a
woman, the woman should be buried first, even if the man died first,
for it is written, ""And Miriam died there, and was buried there,""
(which means) the burial was immediately after her death.

7

When a person sheds tears over the death of a virtuous person, the
Holy One, blessed is He, counts the tears, and stores them in His
treasure house. This is also an atonement for the sin of pollution, and
prevents the death of his small children, God forbid.

8

If a person sees the funeral procession, and fails to join the procession,
he is guilty of mocking the poor, and is deserving of excommunication.
He should accompany the dead at least a distance of four Amos. Even





when one is exempt from accompanying the dead (as in paragraph 9),
he, nevertheless, must rise before the procession. He does not rise in
deference to the dead, but to those attending to the dead, for they are
engaged in performing a mitzvah. This is the law with regard to every
mitzvah in which a person is engaged. It is required that all must rise
before him; and, therefore, workmen used to rise before those bringing
Bikkurim.
9

Nowadays, it is assumed that every Jew has studied [some] Scripture
and some Mishnah. Therefore, when he dies, even the study of Torah
must be interrupted in order to participate in his funeral procession.
However, for a woman or a child, the custom is to be lenient, and not
to interrupt Torah study in order to attend their funeral. School
children, should never be interrupted from Torah study. Even for the
purpose of building the Beis Hamikdash, they must not be interrupted.

10

Great care must be taken that men and women should not mingle
together when going to the cemetery and especially upon returning
from the cemetery, for this could be dangerous, God forbid.

11

The pallbearers should not wear sandals on their feet (the kind without
heels that can easily slip off their feet), but they may wear shoes.

12

At approximately thirty amos from the grave the pallbearers should halt
with the coffin every four amos, so that they can halt seven times. These
seven stops are symbolic of the seven maamados which are equal to the
seven times that vanity is mentioned in Koheles, and to the seven portals
of Gehenom, and to the seven judgements that are passed upon the
dead. They should wait a little at each stop, for the delay atones,





somewhat, for the dead. On a day that tachanun is not recited, these
halts are not necessary, for on those days the judgement is not that
severe.
13

Upon reaching the cemetery, those who have not seen graves in thirty
days must say the berachah, ""Asher Yatzar Esschem Baddin"" etc. (""Who
has created you in judgement""), after which, is said: ""Attah Gibbor""
(""You are mighty"") etc. until, ""Lehachayos meisim"" (""To restore the dead
to life"").

14

Afterwards, Tzidduk Haddin is recited, beginning with ""Hatzur Tamim
Paalo"" etc. (""The Rock is perfect in His ways""). This prayer is begun by
one of the mourners. If there is no mourner present, it is begun by the
most distinguished person present. On days that Tachanun is not said,
Tzidduk Haddin is not said. Therefore, it is not said on erev Shabbos,
after midday, and not on erev Yom Tov. But on erev Rosh Chodesh, erev
Chanukah, and erev Purim, it is said, even after midday. If the deceased
is a Torah scholar, it is also said on Lag Be'omer, and on the days
between Rosh Chodesh Sivan and Shavuos, on the ninth day of Av, and
on erev Rosh Hoshana before noon.

15

At night, there is no recitation of Tzidduk Haddin or Kaddish at the
cemetery.

16

For an infant less than thirty days old, Tzidduk Haddin is not recited.
"
"1

The burial mentioned in the Torah, means actually placing the body in
the earth. In many places it is customary to place the deceased in a





wooden coffin, and he is buried in that manner. Since it is impossible
that such a coffin is without holes [at the bottom], it is sufficient to
bury him is such a way. In some places the body is buried without a
coffin, rather it is placed actually on the earth, without a board
underneath, but with one board placed on each side, and one more
board on top of them to prevent any dirt from falling upon the body,
which would be a dishonor to him. In other communities, ordinary
men are buried without a coffin, and only for kohanim and firstborn
males, who are of special importance, are coffins made. When making a
coffin, care must be taken that the remnants of the boards not be used
for any other purpose. They should be burned for fuel to heat the
cauldron in which water is warmed for the ritual purification of the
deceased. Benevolent people, who in their lifetime fed the poor at their
table, should be buried in a coffin made of boards from the table, as it
is written, ""And your righteousness shall go before you.""
2

The body is laid on its back, its face upward. If the deceased had
prepared earth from Eretz Yisroel, some of it is spread underneath his
body and some on top of it, as it is said ""And His land shall atone His
people."" The main place to put this earth is on the ""holy covenant"" (of
circumcision) and also on his mouth, his eyes, and his hands.

3

Two persons should not be buried close to each other, unless the wall
that separates them can stand by itself, and is at least six finger breadths
thick. If possible, it is best to be strict, so that the thickness of the
separation is six tefachim. However, a man or woman may be buried
with their son or daughter, or with their grandson or granddaughter.
This is the rule: A minor who may sleep with him in his lifetime, may
be buried with him after his death. However, an adult son with his





father, or an adult daughter with her mother, should not be buried
together. Even the burial of a minor [with his parent] is permissible
only when they are buried at the same time, but if one of them had
already been buried, it is forbidden to bury the other with him.
4

It has been explained in chapter 163:7, that if an uncircumcised infant
dies, he should be circumcised at his grave, and a name given to him. A
female infant should also be given a name; and the Burial Society must
be informed of this law.

5

Two coffins must not be placed one atop the other, unless there is at
least six tefachim of earth between them.

6

A wicked person should not be buried next to a righteous person, as it
is said, ""Do not gather my soul with sinners."" Even a very wicked man,
should not be buried next to a less wicked man. Similarly, a righteous
man should not be buried, and certainly a man of average piety and
virtue, should not be buried next to a man who excelled in saintliness.
Two people who hated one another should not be buried next to each
other, for even in their death they will have no peace together.

7

One should be mindful of the custom not to take a shovel or a pick axe
from the hand of another when burying the dead; rather the one who
used it lays it down, and the other picks it up.

8

After the body is laid in the grave, the bier is turned over three times,
for the numerical value of the word mittah (bed, bier) is the same as
that of the word Din (judgement). This is an omen that the judgement
will be turned into mercy, and the mourning into joy. The verse alludes





to this, ""You turned my mourning into dancing."" On a day when
Tachanun is not said, this is not done.
9

If an orphan is present in the cemetery, then, after the burial, (if it is
still day) the people should step away a distance of at least four amos
from the graves and recite the psalm, ""Lamenatzaich"" (""To the chief
musician"") etc. ""Shimu Zos"" (""Hear this"") etc. On a day when
Tachanun is not said, ""Michtam Le'Dovid"" etc. is said. The orphan then
says the Kaddish: ""D'Hu Assid Lehischadetah"" (""That he will renew""),
and those present recite with him up to ""Vikarei"" (And may this
happen). In some communities it is customary that the Kaddish is
recited first before the burial, following Tzidduk Haddin. There are
communities where even Tzidduk Haddin is not said until after the
burial.

10

It is customary, upon leaving the cemetery to pluck some grass and
throw it behind your back and say, ""He is mindful that we are dust.""
This is also symbolic of the resurrection of the dead, who will emerge
living from their dust, as it is said, ""And may they blossom out of the
city like grass of the earth."" This may also be done on Chol Hamoed.
They should then wash their hands. There is a symbolic allusion to this
practice, for this impurity (death) can be purified only by means of
these three things: water, ashes of the Red Cow, and the hyssop. This
handwashing should not be done in a river, but with water poured from
a vessel. You should not take the vessel from the hand of another who
washed; rather the first one puts it down and the others take it, and the
hands should not be wiped. Some say that one should sit down seven
times, because of the evil spirits that accompany him, and when one
sits, they flee. In some places they are accustomed to sit only three





times after they wash their hands, and they say each time: ""Vehi Noam""
etc. [And may the pleasantness (of our master etc.)] Even when the
burial takes place on Yom Tov they can sit three times, as on the
weekdays. It is our custom to be mindful that a person should not enter
his house before washing his hands and sitting down. The customs of
our ancestors have the validity of Torah law.
11

The deceased should not be brought from a city where there is a
cemetery to another city, because it is degrading to transport him from
place to place, unless it is from the diaspora to Eretz Yisroel, or if they
are transporting him to the burial ground of his ancestors. Also, if he
had instructed that he should be brought from place to place, it is
permissible to do so.

12

It is forbidden to open a grave after it was closed, that is after earth had
been placed over the lid of the coffin; but as long as earth has not been
placed there, it is permitted to open it for any reason. If for any reason
it becomes necessary to remove a body from its grave, a Poseik should
be consulted.

13

If a grave has been dug, it should not be left open overnight, because
there is danger in this. If there is no time to bury the deceased until the
following day, the grave must be refilled with earth.

14

It is forbidden to step upon graves because some Poskim maintain that
it is forbidden to derive benefit from them. However, if you have to
visit a certain grave, and have no way of getting there unless you step
upon other graves, it is permitted.




15


You may not go to the cemetery, or within four amos of the deceased, or
in a room where the deceased lies while wearing Tefillin upon your head
or tzitzit in your garment, for it seems as if you are ""mocking the poor.""
But if they are covered, it is permitted. Likewise, you are not allowed to
pray there, or to recite Psalms, unless it is in honor of the dead.

16

In the cemetery, you should not indulge in levity, out of respect to the
dead. This means you may not eat or drink there, or respond to
nature's call. And you may not allow cattle to graze there, and not
gather the vegetation that grows there. However, if trees are planted in a
cemetery and do not grow over the graves, it is permitted to pick their
fruit.

17

It is customary in some communities not to put up a tombstone until
after twelve months, because a tombstone is a mark of distinction, and
within these twelve months the deceased is in grief. Also, because the
reason for putting up a tombstone is so that the dead not be forgotten,
and, as a rule, the deceased is not forgotten until after twelve months.
There are communities where no heed is paid to this custom.
"
"1

If the deceased awaits burial on the first day of (Yom Tov,) a Jew is not
allowed to bury him. Even if it is impossible to have it done by nonJews, and there is concern that decay might set in before the next day,
nevertheless, a Jew may not bury him on the first day of Yom Tov. But
if it is possible to have non-Jews bury him, that is to have non-Jews dig
the grave, and cut the wooden planks, or make the coffin, where it is





customary, and sew the shrouds if necessary; then dressing him, heating
the water, washing him, removing him, and placing him into the grave,
are permitted to be done by a Jew. Covering him with earth must also
be done only by non-Jews. If possible, care should be taken to cleanse
and purify him without using a cloth, in order not to wring out the
water.
2

Some Poskim say, if it is possible to have the burial performed by nonJews, as stated above, it is forbidden to keep the body till the next day
in order that Jews may attend to it. And even if he died that day, and
his body could be kept till the next day without decay setting in,
nevertheless, he should be buried that day by non-Jews. In the case of
an infant who died, even if he lived for more than thirty days, whereby
we know that he is not an aborted fetus, nonetheless, if the weather is
cold and it is not a dishonor to keep him, as he has not become
malodorous, he should not be buried on the first day of Yom Tov, but
should be kept until the second day of Yom Tov. Some say, even in the
case of an adult, if he has not become malodorous, his burial should be
delayed until the second day of Yom Tov. In a place where there is no
fixed custom, it is proper to follow the latter opinion.

3

On the second day of Yom Tov, even the second day of Rosh Hoshana, if
it is possible to accomplish the above mentioned things without delay
through non-Jews. they should be done by non-Jews. The other things
should be done by Jews, as was previously stated. The purification may
be performed with cloths and sheets, but care must be taken not to
wring the water out of them directly. If it is impossible to have those
other things done by non-Jews, Jews may attend to all his needs as
though it were a weekday, because the second day of Yom Tov, with





reference to the dead, was regarded by the Sages as a weekday.
Nevertheless, if someone in that area had previously prepared shrouds
for themselves, those shrouds should be used in order to avoid the need
of sewing. It is permitted to attend his needs only when they intend to
bury him on that day. But if they do not intend to bury him on that
day, no preparations should be made for his burial; and it is even
forbidden to handle the body.
4

The Sages considered the second day of Yom Tov as a weekday, with
regard to the dead in order to honor the dead and not permit him to lie
in disgrace. However, to do anything unconnected to his burial is
forbidden. Therefore, it is forbidden to negotiate with the shopkeeper
about the price of linen for the shrouds, unless it is impossible to obtain
it otherwise, as when it can be bought from a non-Jew. Jewish
gravediggers are forbidden to accept renumeration for their work on a
Yom Tov, because wages for work done on Shabbos or Yom Tov are
forbidden. If they refuse to work without pay, they may be paid, but
they will have to face the judgement of the Heavenly Court. The Burial
Society should not take money for the grave on Yom Tov, but they may
accept pledges (collateral) without stipulating the price of the grave.

5

If there is no Jewish cemetery in town, although there is a place where
this deceased can be buried, nevertheless, it is permitted to take him to
another city on the first day of Yom Tov, by a non-Jew, and on the
second day of Yom Tov, even by a Jew, in order to bury him in a Jewish
cemetery. But if the burial will not take place on that day, it is
forbidden for a Jew to move him on Yom Tov in order to bury him after
Yom Tov.




6


It is permitted to accompany the deceased within the t'chum, on the
first day of Yom Tov, and on the second day of Yom Tov, even outside
the t'chum. It is also permitted to return home on that very day.
However, it is forbidden to ride upon an animal in order to accompany
the dead on Yom Tov, even on the second day of Yom Tov. Even the
mourners are not permitted. If it is impossible for the gravediggers to
go by foot, they are permitted to ride on an animal on the second day
of Yom Tov. Nevertheless, they should not ride in the city.

7

If one dies on the night of the second day of Yom Tov, when it is
permitted for Jews to attend to the burial if there are no non-Jews to do
so, ten men should rise in the morning and bury him at the time the
Chazan recites the Piyutim [festival hymns]. If he was a distinguished
person, so that a multitude of people are obligated to accompany him,
he should be buried after people leave the synagogue before the meal is
eaten, for the Midrash states, ""(It is written) 'You shall not eat with the
blood' (which signifies) that it is forbidden to eat a regular meal before
the deceased is buried."" If it is impossible to make all the preparations
for the burial by that time, he should be buried after the meal.

8

If an infant dies after thirty days, so that it is certain that it is not an
abortive fetus, the same law applies to him as to an adult. However, if
he is a male, and for some reason he was not yet circumcised, even
though decay is setting in, he should not be buried on the first day of
Yom Tov, because his foreskin must be removed, (as stated above,
Chapter 163:7) and that cannot be done by a non-Jew. Rather it should
be held over until the second day of Yom Tov, for it is permitted to





delay [the burial] for his honor; and on the second day, his foreskin
should be removed, and he should be buried.
9

If an infant dies and there is doubt if it is an abortive fetus, if decay has
not yet set in, it may not be buried on the first day of Yom Tov, even by
a non-Jew, and it is held over till the second day of Yom Tov, and then
buried by a non-Jew, and not by a Jew. If decay has set in, it should be
buried on the first day of Yom Tov by a non-Jew. If it died on the
second day of Yom Tov, it should be buried on that very day by a nonJew and not by a Jew. If he is a male, and was not yet circumcised, even
if decay has set in, he should not be buried even on the second day of
Yom Tov and not even by a non-Jew, but he should be held over until
after Yom Tov. His foreskin should then be removed, and he should be
buried.

10

On Shabbos and Yom Kippur, it is not permitted to attend the dead in
any way, even by means of a non-Jew.

11

On Chol Hamoed, the deceased should not be brought to the cemetery
before the grave is ready, so that it is not necessary for the bier to
remain waiting.
"
"1

A person who commits suicide is unsurpassed in wickedness, as it is
said, ""However of the blood of your souls, I will demand an account.""
The world was created for a single person, (to indicate that) anyone
who destroys one Jewish life is considered to have destroyed a whole
world. He should, therefore, not be attended in any way. Garments





should not be torn for him, he should not be mourned, nor should he
be eulogized. However, he should be buried, ritually purified and
dressed in shrouds. The rule is: anything that is done out of respect to
the living, should be done for him.
2

Without proof to the contrary, a man is not presumed to be wicked.
Therefore, if a person if found asphyxiated, hanged, or the like, so long
as it is possible to assume that he was murdered, it should not be
considered a suicide.

3

A minor who committed suicide is considered like one who had taken
his life unintentionally. Similarly, an adult who committed suicide, and
it appears he did so because of severe depression, or madness, and the
like, it is considered unintentional. Similarly, if he did so under duress,
because he was afraid of torture, like King Saul, who feared what the
Philistines might do to him, he is like any other deceased person, and
nothing should be withheld from him.

4

All those who separate themselves from the ways of the community,
such as those people who have cast off the yoke of mitzvos from
themselves, and do not include themselves among the Jewish people
with regard to observance of the mitzvos, but are like a liberated sect of
their own; for all these, including apostates, informers, and heretics, the
laws of Onein are not observed, and their death is not mourned. Their
brothers and other relatives dress in white and adorn themselves in
white, eat, drink, and rejoice that the enemies of the Almighty have
perished. Concerning such people, the Scripture says, ""Behold those
who hate you Adonoy, I hate"" also it is said, ""When the wicked perish
there is joy.""




5


If one was executed either by the government or otherwise, even if he
was an apostate, his relatives should mourn over him. For since he was
killed by man and did not die naturally, he had an atonement.

6

If the deceased was an habitual sinner whose sins were motivated by
lustful desire, and he made no confession before his death, mourning
should not be observed for him. But if he did confess, he should be
mourned, even if he had been a thief or a robber.

7

In the case of a child, one or two years old, who was converted with his
father or with his mother, and died, no mourning should be observed
for him.
"
"1

The Kohein is commanded not to defile himself through any form of
contact with the deceased. Even an abortive fetus, whose limbs have not
yet been connected with ligamentous tissue, is considered in this regard
as a dead body. (If, however, the abortion occurred within forty days
from conception, it is considered like water). The dead body need not
be in its entirety, for this law applies even to things that have separated
from the corpse such as blood and the like. He is also forbidden to
defile himself through contact with the severed limb of a living person,
if there is enough flesh on it that were it still connected, it would have
possibly healed. Even if it is his own limb, he is forbidden to defile
himself by touching it. A Kohein is forbidden to enter a house where a
person is close to death, and even though a gosseis (dying person) is
considered alive with regard to everything else, and he is not considered





impure, nevertheless, the Kohein [by entering such a house] violates the
command, ""You shall not desecrate,"" for he is commanded to guard his
priesthood so that it does not become profaned, and the gosseis may die
at any moment.
2

A Kohein is forbidden to enter a dwelling where there is a dead body,
even if the dwelling is very large. Even if there are two rooms, and there
is a dead body in one of them, and in the wall that separates them,
there is a hole one tefach square, he is forbidden to enter even the
second room, because the hole of one tefach square conducts the
impurity into the second room. Likewise, if next to the second room,
there is yet a third room, and between them, too, there is a hole one
tefach square, the impurity passes also to the third room, and so ad
infinitum. If the hole was made to admit light, even if it is only the size
of a small coin, the impurity passes through.

3

Therefore, in our regions, where the roofs project towards the outside
with a width of no less than one tefach, and since we know that the
width of one tefach conveys impurity, this projecting roof is considered
a tent which conveys impurity. Hence, when two houses are close to
each other, if the deceased is in one of them, the impurity passes
through the door, or open window, beneath the ends of the projecting
rooftop, and enters into the second house, through the open window or
door. Thus the Kohein is forbidden to enter even the second house.
This is true even if there are many houses closely adjoining one another.

4

Even if the roofs are not of the same height, but one is higher than the
other, even if the roof of the house where the impurity is found is much
higher than the second roof or vice versa, there is a halachah handed





down by Moshe from [Mount] Sinai, that the height is considered as
lowered, that is, we consider as though the height was pressed down
and lowered until it reaches the lower one. And since if it were lowered
to the level of the bottom one, they would touch, therefore, the
impurity passes from one to the other. But if there would be a space
between them, even if ever so small, the impurity does not pass from
one to the other.

Similarly if a beam lies across an alley as is done for a eiruv, (and) is a
tefach wide, and is covered by the roofs projecting above it to the extent
of tefach on each side. (Like this:)

In such a case, the impurity passes from underneath the roof to
underneath the beam, which conveys the impurity to underneath the
roof of the house on the opposite side. From there it spreads to any
place where there is a dwelling no less than one tefach wide, until it
reaches a barrier or open space. Also, if between the two houses, there is
an arch constructed on the style of a court entrance, like this:

the same law applies. And although the arch has no projecting roof,
nevertheless, the impurity is transmitted from beneath the roof to
underneath the arch. However, at times an arch is constructed on posts
from the ground up, which close up the space between the arch and the
walls of the house. Then, if the arch has no projecting roof covering it,
and the closed spaces on the sides extend further than the roofs that are
above it, in such a case, there is no space through which the impurity
may pass, since there is some open space without a tent covering. At





times, between the houses there is a solid closed wall without an
opening (like this:)

but there is a projecting roof over it. Then the impurity is conveyed
from one roof to another. When necessary, this can be remedied by
removing the tiles of the roof in one place to create an interrupting
[open] space of a tefach wide without a tent. You must be certain that
the wall itself does not project a tefach, as sometimes they make a
projection (to adorn) the wall.
6

There is a halachah transmitted to Moshe from Sinai, concerning the
door through which the deceased will be carried from the house. Since
after the removal the house will again be ritually pure, although the
door is now closed, nevertheless according to halachah, it is considered
as though it is open, and therefore a Kohein is forbidden to stand under
the lintel, even though the door is closed. Also, if there is a roof
projecting a tefach over the door, it conveys the impurity to every
possible place, as though the door were open. However, if there was an
open door or window on another side measuring four square tefachim,
the closed door is not considered as being open, and a Kohein is
permitted to stand there provided the impurity cannot reach him
through the open door or window.

7

If a Kohein is in a house or a room, the doors and windows of which are
closed in such manner that the door is not opened a tefach, and the
window does not have an opening the size of a pundyon (coin), and he
hears that there is a corpse in the vicinity, so that if the door or window
were to be opened, the impurity would reach him, he is forbidden to





open either of them, but he should remain there as is, until the
deceased is carried out; for so long as there is not an opening of a tefach,
the impurity cannot penetrate, but when it is opened, it can penetrate.
8

A kohein is forbidden to approach within four amos of a deceased
person or a grave. This applies only when the deceased lies in his
permanent place. But when he lies on the bier during the funeral
procession, or when they are saying Tzidduk Haddin, even when they
stop with the bier, since this is not his permanent place, the Kohein
need keep away only a distance of four tefachim.

9

If a Kohein is asleep in a house where there is a deceased person, where
the impurity of the deceased penetrates, and it is impossible to shut
him in, in order to prevent the access of the impurity, he should be
awakened and told to leave the premises. If he is undressed, he should
not be told about the impurity, but merely called outside so that he
may get dressed first; for a person's dignity is very important. However,
as soon as he is aware of the impurity, he is forbidden to wait there
until he gets dressed, but he must leave immediately.

10

Some Poskim maintain that even the corpse of a non-Jew causes
impurity in a house. A Kohein should be mindful of this opinion and
not walk over the grave of a non-Jew. Especially when there is reason to
believe that an apostate may have been buried there (too), for an
apostate is like a Jew (in this regard). Also the child born by an apostate
woman from a non-Jew, is like in Jew in this regard.

11

A Kohein is permitted to defile himself at the death of his relatives, and
it is a mitzvah for him to do so. These are the relatives for which he





may defile himself: his wife whom he was permitted to marry, his
father, his mother, his son or his daughter, his brother and sister born
from his father, provided they were born full term, but for a child who
may have been aborted, a Kohein may not defile himself. He may not
defile himself for a married sister. Some Poskim maintain that which a
Kohein is permitted and is a mitzvah to defile himself for relatives is
only for the needs of burial, or to bring a coffin, or shrouds, or the like.
Consequently, on Shabbos, a day when he may not be buried, a Kohein
is forbidden to defile himself even in order to guard the deceased. It is
proper to follow this strict opinion. However, concerning things
necessary for burial, it is certainly a mitzvah for him to defile himself.
Even if there is a Burial Society to take care of all the arrangements, and
he has nothing to take care of, he is permitted to be in the house in case
they might need something. He may defile himself for these relatives
only until the grave is closed, and not thereafter.
12

A Kohein is forbidden to defile himself for parents who abandoned the
practices of the Jewish people, and not for one who committed suicide.
Similarly, a Kohein is forbidden to defile himself for anyone for whom
the rules of mourning need not be observed.

13

A Kohein may not defile himself for a relative unless the body is
complete but not if it is missing a limb. Therefore some Poskim
maintain that a Kohein may not defile himself for a slain relative, for his
body is considered incomplete; and it is proper to heed this strict
opinion.

14

Some ignorant Kohanim are accustomed to visit the graves of the
righteous, maintaining that the graves of the righteous do not defile.





They are in error, and such practice should be protested.
15

Just as an [adult] Kohein is warned against defiling himself, so too are
adult Kohanim warned concerning minors, as it is said, ""Say to the
Kohanim… and say (to them)."" Because the word ""say"" is written twice,
our Sages, of blessed memory, inferred from this that the adults are
warned concerning the minors. They must not be the direct cause of
their defilement by bringing them into a house where there is a
deceased person, but if the minor defiles himself on his own, there is no
need to remove him. However, if he has reached the age of training, he
should be removed. The pregnant wife of a Kohein is permitted to enter
a house containing a corpse.

16

The Kohanim cannot force the relatives of the deceased to hasten the
removal of the deceased from its place so that they may enter their
homes, unless the Kohein is ill and is unable to leave the house. In that
case the relatives are forced to remove the deceased, so as not to cause
the sick [Kohein] to transgress a law of the Torah. If the deceased is an
aborted fetus, its relatives can be forced, in any event, to remove it, even
on Shabbos through a non-Jew.
"
"1

One is obligated to mourn for seven relatives: his father and mother, his
son and daughter, his brother and sister, whether from a common
father or mother, and even a married sister, a husband for his wife, and
a wife for her husband.




2


It is customary for other relatives too, to observe partial mourning
during the first week until after Shabbos. It is therefore customary not
to bathe in warm water, and not to change their clothing as they do
every other Shabbos. Not all relatives are alike in this respect. For a first
cousin, a son's son or a daughter's son, one should wear all his Shabbos
clothing except for his outer garment. For a father-in-law, a mother-inlaw, or for a paternal or maternal grandfather; also a woman for her
father-in-law, her mother-in-law, and for her paternal or maternal
grandfather, they should wear only a white Shabbos shirt, and a woman
may also wear her white scarf. It is also customary not to bathe, and not
to shampoo the hair. One should also not eat out of the house at a
religious feast or at any social gatherings. After Shabbos, all of these
activities are permitted.

3

When it is not known if a child was born at term or prematurely, if he
died within thirty days after birth, or even on the thirtieth day, even if
his hair and nails were fully grown, one does not tear his garments for
him, nor does he observe the laws of onein. Neither does he mourn for
him, because it may have been an aborted child. If he died after thirty
days, even on the thirty-first day at an earlier hour than that on which
he was born, one must tear his garments, observe the laws of onein, and
mourn over him, unless it is known for sure, that he was born in the
eighth month of pregnancy (and is not a viable child). If it was known
for sure that he was born in the ninth month, for example, if after
cohabitation, the father was separated from his wife, and he was born
alive, nine full months later, even if he dies on the day he was born, one
must tear his garments, observe the laws of onein and mourn over him.




4


If one of twin children dies within thirty days after birth or even on the
thirtieth day, and the other survives after thirty days, we do not draw
the conclusion, that since one lived after thirty days, the other one, too,
was a viable child. Therefore mourning is not observed for him.

5

A male or female proselyte who converted to Judaism with their
children, do not observe mourning for one another; for a proselyte is
considered like a new-born infant, and their kinship when they were
Gentiles is no longer recognized as kinship.
"
"1

The mourning period begins from the time the deceased is buried, and
the grave is filled with earth. The mourner must remove his shoes at the
cemetery. If he has to walk home through a non-Jewish neighborhood,
he may wear his shoes, but should place a little earth in them.

2

If the cemetery is close to the city, and the mourner did not go [to the
cemetery] but went straight home after the funeral service, he does not
observe the laws of mourning until he is told that the grave has been
filled. However, if night is approaching and he wants this day counted
as one of the seven days of mourning, then, from the time he assumes
that the grave was filled, he may begin to observe mourning. If he is
informed thereafter that the grave was filled before nightfall, he may
count that day as one of the seven, and if it was the day preceding a
Festival, the Festival cancels the remainder of the seven days of
mourning.




3


In places where the deceased are sent to another city for burial, and
they do not know when he will be buried, the mourners who remain in
the city should begin to observe the period of mourning immediately
upon returning from the funeral, and count from that time the seven
days and the thirty days of mourning. The mourners who accompany
the deceased to the place of burial count from the time he was buried.
Some poskim maintain that if the head of the family accompanies the
deceased, then also those who remain behind count from the time he
was buried. They have to estimate the time he was buried, and begin to
observe the laws of mourning. (Regarding the intervening days, See
above Chapter 196:5, 6) It is only regarding a more strict application
that the other mourners follow the head of the family, and even those
who remain at home start counting from the time of burial, but if the
head of the family remained at home, those mourners who accompany
the deceased are not subject to him, rather they begin to count from
the time of the burial.

4

If a person drowned, or was murdered by non-Jews, and his body was
not found for burial, so long as the search has not been abandoned, the
laws of onein and mourning do not apply, and even marital relations are
permitted. From the time the search is finally abandoned, they begin to
observe the laws of mourning. If, after they finish the period of
mourning, the body is found, and brought to burial they need not
observe another mourning period. However, if the deceased is his father
or mother, he must tear his garments. If a man drowned and left a wife,
and proof of his death is so unsubstantiated that she cannot be
permitted to remarry, mourning should not be observed for him, and
Kaddish should not be recited for him. Nevertheless, his kin should try





to ease his soul by occasionally leading the prayers at services in the
synagogue, by reading the Haftorah, by leading the Birkas Hamazon, by
giving charity, and by learning Torah, or by hiring someone else to learn
Torah in his memory.
5

If a person lost a relative, and he was not there at the time of death but
learned about it later at the place where he is, he should count the days
of mourning from the time he became aware of it. Even though
afterwards he arrives at the place of the deceased, where the other
mourners reside, who began their mourning before he did, he must not
abreviate his mourning period because of this. Similarly, even if he was
not aware of it until he came to the mourners, but the mourners are
neither at the place where the death occurred, nor where he was buried,
he too, begins to count [the days of mourning] from the time he
became aware of it.

6

However if he was not aware of it, until he came to the mourners, and
they are at the place where the death occured, or at the place where he
was buried, then if at the time of the burial he was near by, that is not
further than ten parasangs, which is a day's walk, it is considered
though he was present at the time of the burial and he counts together
with them. Even if he came on the seventh day, before the people leave
the Synagogue, since the mourners are still observing some mourning,
he counts the seven and thirty days of mourning with them. This is so
only when the head of the family is with them, as they all follow him,
but if the head of the family is not there, he counts on his own, or if he
came from far away, even if the head of the family is there, nevertheless
he must count on his own.




7


If a person began counting with the mourners who were present, even if
he returns to his home, nevertheless he continues counting with them.

8

The head of the family who is close by does not follow the younger
members, but counts on his own.

9

Who is called the head of the family? It is the one whose judgement
would be accepted and whose advice everyone would follow, if they
were engaged in dividing the inheritance. Even if he is young in years
and even if he is not an heir, he is called the head of the family. For
example, if the widow is present, and she manages the household, she is
called the head of the family. If a person lives with his father-in-law,
and his wife dies, his father-in-law is the head of the family.

10

If one becomes aware of the death of his relative after the congregation
had prayed the Maariv service, but it is still day, if he has not yet prayed
Maariv, he is not drawn after the congregation, and he can include that
day in his mourning period. If, however, he too had already prayed
Maariv, that day is not counted, and he must count the seven days of
mourning and the thirty days of mourning from the following day. This
rule is applied only for stricter observance and not for leniency. Thus if
he becomes aware of the death on the thirtieth day after the burial, after
he has already prayed Maariv, we do not say that it is already night and
it is delayed news to make it lenient for him, but we consider it as day,
and thus it is a timely news. Either way this day counts towards the
mourning period. With regard to Tefillin on the other days, if he heard
of the death after he has prayed Maariv but it is still daytime, he should
put them on the next day without reciting the berachah and he should





cover them. If this happened on the thirtieth day, he should put on
Tefillin the following day, and should recite the berachah regardless. If a
woman heard of the death of a relative, after the congregation prayed
the Maariv service, but it is still daytime, if she usually does not pray
Maariv, she is drawn after the congregation for the strict application of
the law, and that day is not counted as one of the days of mourning.
11

During a plague, God forbid, it is customary not to observe any
mourning, because of the prevailing fear and panic. If the plague passed
within thirty days from the day of death, the laws of mourning must be
observed. However, if the plague did not pass, until after thirty days
from the day of death, or if a Festival had intervened in the meantime,
mourning need not be observed.
"
"1

On the first day of mourning, the mourner is forbidden to eat his first
meal from his own food. It is a mitzvah for his neighbors to send him
food for his first meal, which is called the meal of condolence. This
meal should begin with eggs or lentils, for they are round and have no
mouth, just as the mourner has no mouth (speech). After this course he
may eat all foods, even meat. He is permitted to drink a little wine
during the meal, in order to help digest the food in his stomach, but
not enough to satisfy his desire. (Some Poskeim maintain that he is
forbidden to eat of his own food the entire first day, even if he eats
many meals on that day).

2

If the mourner does not wish to eat that day until nightfall, since the
day has passed, he is permitted to eat of his own food. Therefore, if he





lives alone in a village, and there is nobody to send him the meal of
condolence, it is proper for him to fast until nightfall. Nevertheless, if
he cannot fast, he is not obliged to afflict himself, and he may eat of his
own food.
3

If a married woman became a mourner, she is forbidden to eat her first
meal from her husband's food, for since it is his duty to support her, it
is considered as her own food. Similarly, if a hired person works for
someone and his meals are part of his wages, and he became a mourner,
he should not eat his first meal from his employers's food. However, if a
person supports an orphan, or his own grownup son or daughter
without any legal commitment to do so, and they became mourners,
they may eat their first meal from his food for it is not considered as
their own.

4

A woman should not be provided with the condolence meal by men,
rather women should provide her with the meal.

5

If the deceased was buried at night and the mourner wishes to eat at
night, he is forbidden to eat of his own food, but it must be provided
for him by others. If he does not wish to eat that night, he is forbidden
to eat his first meal from his own food during the daytime, for since the
daytime follows the night, it is still the first day of his mourning.

6

If the burial took place on Friday, after the ninth hour of the day, when
it is forbidden to eat a regular meal, he should not be sent the meal of
condolence out of respect for the Shabbos and the mourner should eat
nothing until the evening.




7


The meal of condolence is sent only to one who received timely news,
but it is not sent to one who received delayed news. If one received
timely news on Shabbos, the condolence meal is not sent to him for he
may eat his own food. Also on the following day (Sunday) the
condolence meal is not sent to him, because the need for it was
cancelled on the day he received the news.

8

Also, if one's relative dies, and was buried on Yom Tov, the condolence
meal is not sent to him. After Yom Tov you also do not send him this
meal because the need for it was already cancelled. However, if the
burial took place on Chol Ha'moed, the condolence meal should be sent
to him, but he should eat it while sitting on a chair, at the table, in his
usual manner, because there is no mourning on Chol Ha'moed.

9

It was the custom to fast on the day a Torah scholar passed away.
"
"1

If a person heard of the death of a relative for whom he is obliged to
observe mourning, within thirty days of his death or even on the
thirtieth day itself, such tidings are timely and he must tear his
garments. He is obliged to observe the seven days of mourning from
the day he received the news. The thirty days of mourning are also
counted from the day he received the news. And the day he received the
news is like the day of burial with regard to all its laws. The thirty-day
period during which the news is considered timely is counted from the
day of burial, and not from the day of death.




2


If he received the news after thirty days, it is delayed news, and he
needs to observe the laws of mourning for only one hour. Whether he
received the news by day or he received it at night, one hour of
mourning is sufficient. This is true even for one's parents. However, the
mourning which is observed for one's father or mother during the
entire twelve months applies even when the news of the death was
delayed. These twelve months are counted from the day of death. If one
received word of the death of his father or mother, after twelve months,
he need observe only one hour of mourning, even with regard to things
that are usually observed throughout the twelve months.

3

One who receives delayed news need not observe all the laws of
mourning, and removal of his shoes is sufficient. He is permitted to
work, bathe, anoint himself, to have marital relations and to study
Torah. If he was not wearing shoes when he received the news, he must
do something else to indicate that he is doing so to observe mourning
such as sitting on the ground for an hour.

4

If he received timely news on Shabbos, the Shabbos is counted as one
day, and at the conclusion of Shabbos he must tear his garments and
observe six days of mourning.

5

If he received timely news on Shabbos or on Yom Tov, but at the
conclusion of Shabbos or Yom Tov it will become delayed news, he
must observe all the laws of private mourning on Shabbos or Yom Tov
and at the conclusion of Shabbos or Yom Tov he should observe one
hour's mourning as is done for delayed tidings.




6


If he received timely news on Shabbos and it is the eve of a Yom Tov,
since he must observe mourning in privacy, the Yom Tov cancels the
seven days of mourning.

7

If one received delayed news on Shabbos or Yom Tov, he should not
observe any mourning, not even in private matters. At the conclusion
of Shabbos or Yom Tov, he should observe one hour of mourning, and
that is sufficient.

8

If one found out after Yom Tov that a relative had died before Yom Tov,
although for those who observed mourning before Yom Tov, the Yom
Tov cancels the remaining days, nevertheless, since he did not observe
any mourning before Yom Tov, the remaining days are not cancelled.
[In such a case] if he received the news even on the thirtieth day after
the burial, it is timely news for him, and he must observe the seven and
thirty-day periods of mourning.

9

If a person lost a relative and does not know about it, you should not
inform him of it. Concerning one who bears such news it is said, ""He
who utters a report is a fool."" You are permitted to invite him to a
betrothal feast and to any other joyful gathering, for as long as he is
uninformed, he is like any other person. Also, if a husband knows that
his wife's relative died, he is permitted to have marital relations with
her, since she does not know about it.

10

However, if you are asked if a relative is alive, you should not lie and say
he is alive, for it says, ""Keep far from a false matter,"" but you should
answer him in an ambiguous way, so that he will understand himself
that he had died.




11


It is customary to notify sons when their mother or father pass away so
that they may say the Kaddish.
"
"1

It is a great mitzvah to console mourners. We find that the Holy One
blessed is He, consoled mourners, as it is written, ""And it came to pass
after the death of Avraham, that God blessed his son,"" Yitchak, This is
an act of kindness to the living as well as to the deceased. The
comforters are not allowed to speak before the mourner begins to
speak, as it is said concerning Job, ""And none spoke a word to him;""
and it is written, ""And after this Job opened his mouth;"" and later it is
written ""Eliphaz Hateimani answered."" If the comforters perceive that
the mourner wishes them to leave, they are not allowed to remain there.

2

A mourner or a sick person is not required to rise even before a Nasi.
[Under normal circumstances] it is mannerly, when someone wants to
honor his friend, and rise before him, his friend should say, ""Sit.""
However to a mourner or to a sick person, he should not say this, for it
might be construed as ""Sit in your mourning"" or ""Sit in your illness"".

3

A person should not say, ""I have not been punished sufficiently for my
evil deeds,"" or similar expressions, so as not to open the mouth of the
Satan.

4

You should not say to the mourner, ""What can you do? It is impossible
to change what the Holy One blessed is He has done,"" for this is like
blasphemy, for it implies that were it possible to change it, he would do





so. Rather a person must accept upon himself the decree of the
Almighty, blessed is He, with love.
5

Mourners should observe their mourning in the place where the soul of
the deceased departed, for in that place, the soul of the deceased
grieves, and that is the place to comfort it. It is a mitzvah to pray there
with a minyan of ten men in the morning and evening, even if there is
no mourner present, for it is a consolation for the soul. If there is a
mourner present, he may be counted in the minyan. A Seifer Torah
should be brought there earlier, and a suitable place should be prepared
for it, for the entire time they will pray there. If two deaths occurred in
two separate houses, in one of which there is a mourner, while in the
other there is no mourner, and there are not enough worshipers in the
city to have a minyan of ten pray in each house, they should pray in the
house where there is no mourner. In the house of the deceased it is
customary to say, Psalm, ""Lamanetzeach, etc. Shimu Zoss Kol
Ha'ammim"" etc. after Shacharis and Minchah. And it is certainly good
to study Mishnayos there, for the benefit of the soul. (The Hebrew
letters of the word Mishnah. are the same as the word neshoma (soul).)

6

Hallel is not said in the house where the death occured, if the mourner
is present during the first seven days of mourning, (because it is
considered like mocking the poor, for in Hallel we say, ""The dead do
not praise God."") If there is another room, the mourner should go into
that room, and the congregation should say Hallel. And if there is no
other room, then on Rosh Chodesh, those who prayed there need not say
Hallel at home afterwards. But on Chanukah, they must say Hallel in
their homes. And if they are praying in the house where the death
occured but where there is no mourner present, or in the mourner's





house, but the death did not occur there, Hallel should be recited even
on Rosh Chodesh, but the mourner should not recite it, (because in it, it
is said, ""This day was made by Adonoy; let us exult and rejoice in
Him."") If the seventh day of mourning occurs during the days of
Chanukah, then after the comforters leave, at which time mourning
ceases, the mourner, too, must recite the Hallel, because it is obligatory.
Other Poskim are of the opinion that on Chanukah, Hallel should be
recited even in the house of a mourner with the Minyan. If Rosh
Chodesh occurs on Shabbos, Hallel should be recited with the Minyan,
even in the house of a mourner, for on Shabbos, public mourning is
not observed.
7

The special berachos for mourners in the Birkas Hamazon is not part of
our custom today, because we rely on the opinion of the Poskim who
maintain that these berachos were enacted to be said only when Birkas
Hamazon is recited with a minyan of ten.
"
"1

These are the things a mourner is forbidden to do during the first seven
days: to work, to bathe, to anoint himself to wear shoes and to engage
in marital relations. He is forbidden to study Torah, he is forbidden to
offer greetings, he is forbidden to wear a pressed garment, cut his hair,
or be present at any festivity. He is also forbidden to put on Tefillin the
first day.

2

What are the rules concerning work? During the first three days a
mourner must not perform any work, even if he is a poor man who
relies on charity. But after the fourth day if the mourner is a poor man,





and has nothing to eat, he may work privately at home. A woman may
also work privately in her own home to earn enough for her sustenance.
But our Sages say: ""May a curse fall on the mourner's neighbors who
made it necessary for him to do work,"" for it is their duty to provide for
the poor, especially during the days of his mourning.
3

It is forbidden even to have his work done by others, and even by a
non-Jew. If the work is very urgent and he might sustain a loss by not
doing it, he should consult a competent Rav.

4

Just as he is forbidden to do work, so is he forbidden to transact
business. If he possesses merchandise, which unless he sells now he will
sustain a loss of the principle, he should consult a competent Rav. If
caravans or ships arrived with merchandise, which is now being sold at
a low price, and will be unavailable later, or, if he was at the market
when he received timely news, he may transact business through others.

5

He may lend money on interest through an agent to non-Jews who are
accustomed to borrow from him. The same applies to selling
merchandise to his regular customers, so that they should not become
accustomed to trade elsewhere.

6

He is permitted to send someone to collect his debts, if he has reason to
fear they might become uncollectable later.

7

Such writing that is permitted on Chol Hamoed is also permitted to a
mourner, if it cannot be done by someone else.

8

If a mourner's field is occupied by a tenant either as a sharecropper,
(e.g., a third or a quarter share) or on lease (whereby the tenant gives





the owner a fixed amount of the field's produce), or on a rental basis
(whereby he pays him an amount of money for rent), they may work
the field as usual, during the owner's time of mourning, for since the
work is for their own benefit (profit), they need not suffer any loss on
the account of the owner's mourning. However, if the mourner has a
day laborer working in his field, he is forbidden to let him work, even if
the field is in another city, since the work being done is for the benefit
of the mourner, and it is done publicly.
9

If the mourner is a sharecropper in the field of another, he himself is
forbidden to do the work, but he may employ others to do it, for it is
not called the work of the mourner, but rather that of the owner of the
field. If others have contracted work for the mourner to do, he is
forbidden to do it even by employing others. But if it is work the delay
of which will cause him to sustain a [substantial] loss, he may have it
done by others.

10

When the animals of a mourner are hired out to another person, the
renter is permitted to do work with them, since he rented them before
the owner became a mourner, and through renting one acquires certain
rights of ownership, and they are considered the property of the renter;
but after expiration of the time for which they were rented, he is
forbidden to use them.

11

A mourner is permitted to accept work to be done after his period of
mourning, provided he does not weigh or measure as he would do at
other times.




12


If the mourner had given work to a contractor, since it is on a
contractual basis, and the work was received prior to his becoming a
mourner, and it is being done privately at the home of the contractor,
the contractor is permitted to do it.

13

Construction of a building belonging to a mourner, even if done by a
non-Jew on a contractual basis, and in a far-away place where no Jews
live, is forbidden. If the work in his field was given to others on a
contractual basis, whereby he pays the worker a fixed wage for all the
work in the field: ploughing, sowing, harvesting, and similar work,
some Poskim permit the work to be done.

14

Domestic chores are not considered forbidden work for a mourner.
Thus, a woman is permitted, during the period of her mourning, to
bake, cook, and do all household chores that she finds necessary. But
that which is not necessary is forbidden to do. Also, a domestic servant
who is in mourning, even though she is a paid servant she is permitted
to do all the housework. But she is not permitted to do work that is not
necessary for the house, but only to earn extra money, and certainly she
may not leave the house just as any other mourner is forbidden to do
so.

15

If two people are partners in a store, and one of them became a
mourner, they must close their store, so that the partner does not do
work in public. But he may do work in the privacy of his home, even in
such matters in which both partners have an interest. If the mourner is
a distinguished person, and the business bears his name, as he has a
share in it, the partner is forbidden to conduct the business even in his





own home. In the event a great loss would be sustained if the the
mourner's partner, too, would not open the store, they should consult a
competent Rav as to whether it may be opened after three days.
"
"1

The mourner is forbidden to wash his entire body even with cold water;
but his face, hands and feet are only forbidden to be washed with warm
water, but are permitted to be washed with cold water. Bathing with
warm water is forbidden during the entire thirty day mourning period,
and even washing the head with warm water is forbidden. Similarly,
bathing the entire body with cold water, if done for pleasure, is
forbidden the entire thirty days. A woman, for the necessity of bathing
before the ritual immersion, is permitted to bathe in warm water after
the seven days of mourning have passed. With regard to wearing clean
white garments, refer to Chapter 159:5.

2

If a woman becomes a mourner after giving birth, and she must bathe,
she is permitted to bathe even during the seven days of mourning.
However, on the first day she should be stringent and not bathe if it is
not that necessary. Similarly, a person of delicate constitution, who
would suffer greatly if he did not bathe, and his health might be
affected, is permitted to bathe. Also, one who has disturbing head pains
is permitted to wash his head with warm water.

3

A mourner is forbidden to anoint himself even in a minimal fashion if
it is for the sake of pleasure. However, if his intention is to remove dirt,





he is permitted to anoint himself. It is certainly permitted for medical
purposes, as when he has scabs on his head.
4

A person who had multiple periods of mourning, such as two
consecutive periods of mourning, is permitted to bathe with cold water.

5

The prohibition against wearing shoes applies only to leather shoes; but
shoes of cloth, reeds, hair, or wood, are permitted, for the term ""shoe""
refers only to a shoe made of leather. A wooden shoe covered with
leather is forbidden. Although the mourner is forbidden to wear shoes,
nevertheless, in the morning he should say the berachah, ""She'assa Lee
Kol Tzarkee"" (""Who provided me with all my needs"").

6

A woman within thirty days after giving birth is permitted to wear
shoes; so is an ill person, or one who has a wound on his foot, because
the cold is harmful to them.

7

A mourner who must travel on the road, is permitted to wear shoes. he
should, however, put a bit of earth in his shoes. Similarly, in all other
instances when a mourner must wear shoes, he should do this.

8

A mourner is forbidden to engage in marital relations. Embracing and
kissing are also forbidden. But other acts of intimacy, such as filling a
cup, making the bed and similar things, are permitted. [It makes no
difference if ] the husband is the mourner, or the wife is the mourner.
"
"1

A mourner is forbidden to study Torah, for it is written, ""The precepts
of Adonoy, are upright, rejoicing the heart."" and a mourner is forbidden





to rejoice. He is forbidden to study the Scriptures, the Mishnah, and
the Talmud, including the laws and Aggadah. But he is permitted to
read the book of Job, Lamentations, and the mournful sections of
Jeremiah. In the Talmud, he may study chapter, V'eelu Megalchin,
dealing with the laws of the excommunicated and the mourner, and
also Maseches Semachos. And in the Seforim (books) of Halachah (laws),
he may study the laws concerning mourning. However, he is forbidden
to probe and analyze even the subjects he is permitted to study.
2

After three days of mourning, one who teaches Torah to children is
permitted to teach the children everything they need to learn, so that
they are not interrupted from their studies; for the (study of ) children
whose mouths are pure of sin, is more precious than the study of adults.
Likewise a mourner's young children should not be interrupted from
their studies, for they are not obligated to observe mourning.

3

Even if the mourner is a Kohein and there is no other Kohein in the
synagogue, he is forbidden to go up to read the Torah.

4

When he prays during all seven days of mourning, a mourner should
not recite Pittum Haketoress, Keitsad [How was the incense
compounded] nor should he say Maamados, and after the Chapter of
Eizehu Mekoman, he should not say Yehi Ratzon etc. [May it be Your
will] (because a mourner may not send offerings). When reciting
Havdalah at the conclusion of Shabbos over a cup [of wine], he should
not say the introductary verses of joy, but should begin immediately
with the berachos.




5


During his seven days of mourning a mourner should not officiate as
Chazzan unless there is no one else to lead the prayers. But if he is in
mourning for his father or mother, the custom is to permit him to be
the Chazzan even if there is someone else capable of doing so. It is
customary that a mourner not be the Chazzan on Shabbos and Yom
Tov during his entire year [of mourning] unless there is no one else to
do so. If he was accustomed to be the Chazzan even before he became a
mourner, he is permitted to do so in any event. See Chapter 128:8
above.

6

What is the rule concerning the exchange of greetings? During the first
three days, a mourner must not greet anyone. If others who are
unaware that he is a mourner greet him, he should not return the
greeting, but should inform them that he is a mourner. From the third
day until the seventh day, he must not greet anyone, but if others who
unaware that he is a mourner greet him, he may respond to their
greetings. From the seventh until the thirtieth day, he may extend
greetings to others for they have peace of mind, but others should not
greet him because he lacks peace of mind. If they did not know he is a
mourner and they greeted him, he may respond to their greetings. After
thirty days, he may exchange greetings like anyone else.

7

Since he is forbidden to greet anybody, he is certainly forbidden to
laugh. Therefore, during the seven days of mourning, he must not take
a child in his arms, so he should not be induced to laughter. He is also
forbidden to engage in lengthy conversation with people. However, if
he does so out of respect for a group of people, as when many come
together to console him, he is permitted to say (when they are leaving),





""Go to your homes in peace,"" for out of respect for a group of people,
it is permitted.
8

In a place where it is customary to greet the mourners on Shabbos, you
may do so. The mourner may greet everybody on Shabbos since it is
done publicly.

9

He is permitted to say the berachah, Shehecheyanu even during the seven
days of mourning, when it is necessary, for instance on Chanukah, or
when eating a new fruit and the like.
"
"1

During the seven days of mourning he is forbidden to sit on a bench or
upon pillows and cushions. He must sit on the ground [floor]. But an
ill or elderly person, who experience pain when sitting on the floor,
may place a small pillow beneath them. However, the mourner may
walk or stand, and is not compelled to sit down at all. Only in the
presence of the consolers is he required to be seated. He is also
forbidden to sleep in a bed or on a bench; he must sleep on the floor.
But he may spread pillows and cushions on the floor as he usually does
in his bed. Some Poskim permit him to sleep in a bed. And some are
accustomed to do so because they have frail constitutions, and are
considered ill in this regard.

2

On the first day, a mourner is forbidden to put on Tefillin, whether it is
the day of death and burial or the day of burial alone. If the burial took
place at night, he may not put on Tefillin the following day. On the
second day of mourning, he should put them on after sunrise. The day





on which one receives timely news is like the day of death and burial.
But if the death occurs on a Festival, or he receives timely news on a
Festival, then, on the first day after the Festival, he should put on
Tefillin.
3

Wrapping the head is not customary in our regions. Nevertheless, one
should make a token wrapping, by pulling down the hat close to the
eyes during the seven days of mourning. This is not done on Shabbos
because this is a public manifestation of mourning.

4

A mourner is forbidden to wear a freshly washed garment, even a shirt,
during the seven days of mourning and not even in the honor of
Shabbos. Even sheets, bedspreads, and hand-towels, are forbidden if
they are freshly washed. However, in honor of Shabbos it is permitted
to cover the table with tablecloths that were washed before the period
of mourning began.

5

Washing his own garments, even if he intends to leave them until after
the seven days of mourning, is forbidden, because it is considered work.
However, if his garments are in the hands of others, they are permitted
to wash them, like any other type of work which they had contracted to
do for him.

6

If one is in a second consecutive period of mourning, he is permitted to
wash his garments with water only (not with ash, soap or the like), and
to wear them.

7

After the seven days of mourning until the thirtieth day, the halacha
that forbids the mourner to wear or spread beneath himself a freshly
washed garment is applicable only if it is ironed (some say this does not





mean ironing, but washing with water and ash or with soda and soap),
and is white and new. But it is the custom to forbid wearing even
washed garments, even if they were not ironed, unless someone else had
worn them for a short time previously. If, however, they were merely
washed with water, it is not necessary that another person wear them
first.
8

If he does not change his garments for pleasure, rather out of necessity,
as when the shirt he is wearing is soiled, or because of a rash, he is
permitted to change his garments even during the first seven days, and
even on a weekday, provided someone had previously worn them.

9

He is permitted to wash and and iron his garments after the seven days
of mourning in order to wear them after the thirty days, or to wear
them during the thirty days, after they will have been worn by someone
else.

10

During the first thirty days he is forbidden to wear Shabbos clothes
even on Shabbos, and he certainly may not wear new clothing. When
mourning the loss of his father or mother, he is by custom forbidden to
wear new clothes during the entire twelve months. If, however, he needs
them, he should let another person wear them first, for two or three
days.

11

A woman, during the first thirty days of mourning, or even during the
first seven days of mourning, whose time has come, to go to the
synagogue on the Shabbos, after giving birth, customarily considers this
Shabbos like a Yom Tov by wearing expensive clothing and gold jewelry.
She is permitted to wear Shabbos clothing, but not her Yom Tov





clothing, lest her mind be diverted, and she forget she is in mourning.
She does not need to change her seat in the synagogue.
12

A mourner is forbidden to have his hair cut during the first thirty days
of mourning, whether it is the hair of his head, the beard, or any other
part of the body. If he mourns the loss of his father or mother, he is
forbidden to cut his hair until he is admonished by his friends. The
estimated time of admonishment is a subject of controversy between
the Poskim. The custom in our regions is not to cut the hair the entire
year unless it is necessary, as when his hair is burdensome to him, or if
he mingles with people of different nationalities, who would look upon
him with scorn because of his hair. In such instances he is allowed to
have it cut, for actual admonishment is not required. But if his hair
grew to such proportions, that he looks different from his friends, so
that people would be apt to say, ""How different he is,"" then he is
allowed to have it cut, provided it is after thirty days of mourning.

13

Just as he is forbidden to have his hair cut during the first thirty days of
mourning, so too is he forbidden to cut his nails with an instrument.
But with his hands or teeth, it is permitted even during the first seven
days. If he is a Mohel, he is forbidden to cut his nails in order to
perform the laceration of the foreskin, unless there is no other Mohel
available, and then he is permitted to do so even during the first seven
days. A woman who needs to perform the ritual immersion after the
first seven days of mourning, but within the thirty days, should ask a
non-Jewess to cut her nails. If a non-Jewess in unavailable, a Jewess may
do it.




14


A mourner is permitted to comb his hair with a comb even during the
first seven days of mourning.

15

If it customary for a mourner to change his place in the synagogue
during the first thirty days of mourning, and after the loss of his father
or mother, for twelve months. The change of place should be at least
four amos away from his original place, and should be to a place that is
farther from the Aron HaKodesh than his original place.
"
"1

A mourner is forbidden to eat at the feasts of either a circumcision,
redemption of a firstborn, or completion of a Talmudic tractate, and
especially a wedding feast, during the thirty days of mourning for a
relative, and during the entire twelve months of mourning for his father
or mother. (Even during a leap-year, twelve months are sufficient).
However, in his own house, when there is a feast in honor of a mitzvah,
he is permitted to participate. However with regard to a wedding feast.
he should be strict [and abstain] even though it is celebrated at his own
house, unless it is a wedding in which he is giving an orphaned groom
or bride to marriage, and his lack of participation may cause the match
to break off. In that case, he is permitted to eat even if the feast is held
in another house. He may then also wear his Shabbos clothing after
thirty days of mourning for his father or mother, or within thirty days
of mourning for other relatives.

2

He is not permitted to invite others or to accept invitations from
others. He may not send gifts to others, and others should not send





gifts to him during the entire thirty days of mourning, or during the
twelve months of mourning for his father or mother. Concerning
Shabbos, it depends on the custom, see Chapter 210:8.
3

If a mourner has been asked to serve as either a Sandek or a Mohel, after
the thirty days of mourning even for his father or mother, he may wear
his Shabbos clothing until after the circumcision, and he may even
partake of the feast.

4

He is forbidden to enter a house where a wedding feast is being held,
during the entire thirty days of mourning for a relative, or the twelve
months of mourning for his father or mother, even to hear the berachos
that are said there. However, during a wedding ceremony that is held in
the court of the synagogue, where they are reciting, the berachos of
betrothal and marriage, he is permitted to stand there and listen to the
berachos after thirty days of mourning even for his father or mother. He
is even permitted to recite the berachos, and may even act as best man to
escort the bridegroom under the chupah. He may wear his Shabbos
clothing, provided it is after the thirty days of mourning. However, he
is not allowed to enter [the house or hall] to partake of the feast. Some
Poskim are lenient, and even permit him to partake of the feast.

5

A mourner may attend a wedding feast if he serves as a waiter. He may
also eat in his own house of what is sent to him from the feast.
"
"1

During the thirty days of mourning it is forbidden for a man to marry.
Likewise, a woman who is a mourner is forbidden to get married until





after the thirty days of mourning are over. After thirty days, they are
permitted even if they are in mourning for a parent. However, an
engagement without a feast, is permitted even during the first seven
days of mourning.
2

If one's wife dies, he should not remarry until the three Festivals have
passed (Pesach, Shavuos, Sukkos). Rejoicing on the Festivals will help
him forget his love for his first wife when he marries the second, so that
he will not drink from this cup and have his mind on the first cup. Rosh
Hashanah and Yom Kippur are not considered Festivals in this respect.
Shemini Atzeress, too, is not considered a separate Festival in this
respect. If he has not yet fulfilled the mitzvah of propagation, or if he
has young children, or if he has no one to look after him, he need not
wait for the passage of three Festivals. Nevertheless, it seems [proper]
that he should wait until after thirty days have passed. A woman whose
husband died, must wait ninety days before remarrying.

3

When everything had been prepared for the wedding, and one of the
relatives of the bridegroom died, or one of the bride's relatives died,
even if it was the groom's father or the bride's mother, in our times,
since others are able to prepare what is needed for the wedding, the
wedding must be postponed until after the days of mourning.

4

Even if the death occurred after the chupah, the mourner is forbidden
to have marital relations until after the seven days of mourning. Since
he has not yet had marital relations with her and he is forbidden to
have marital relations with her, they are forbidden to be alone without a
chaperone. After the seven days of mourning, he may have marital
relations with her, and celebrate the seven days of wedding feasts.




5


However, if after they had marital relations a relative of the groom or
bride died, they are already subject to the laws pertaining to the week of
wedding feasts, which is for them like a Yom Tov, and thus the laws of
mourning are not to be observed. These days are even more lenient
than a Festival, for they are permitted to put on pressed clothing, and
they may have their hair cut. They are forbidden only such things that
are done privately. After the seven days of wedding feasts, the seven
days of mourning begin. Even the first thirty days of mourning are to
be counted only from the beginning of the seven days of mourning.
(Although the days of a Yom Tov are always included in the first thirty
days of mourning as stated in chapter 219:7, the wedding week is not
included since they are permitted to have their hair cut.)
"
"1

During the first seven days of mourning, the mourner may not leave his
house. However, if a death occurs in his family, or even if a stranger
dies, and there are not enough people to attend the funeral and burial,
he is permitted to leave his house even on the first day of mourning. If
he is summoned by the authorities, or if he must attend to something
very urgent to him as otherwise he will sustain a great loss, he is
permitted to leave his house, but he should put some earth in his shoes.

2

Even for the purpose of going to the synagogue to pray, the mourner is
not allowed to leave his house during the seven days of mourning,
except on Shabbos. However, if he is unable to gather a quorum of ten
men for a minyan and would be compelled to pray alone, and there is a





minyan in his neighborhood, he may leave his house to go and pray
there, in order not to miss praying with a minyan.
3

If a mourner has to circumcise his son, he may go to the synagogue for
this purpose even during the first three days of mourning. If the
mourner is the Sandek or Mohel, he may not leave the house on that
account, during the first three days of mourning. After the first three
days, he should pray at home, and when the infant is brought to the
synagogue to be circumcised, he may then go to the synagogue. If there
is no other Mohel in the city. he may go even on the first day of
mourning.
"
"1

It is forbidden to grieve excessively over the dead, as it is said, ""Do not
weep for the dead, and do not bemoan him."" Our Sages of blessed
memory, said, ""Is it possible to say so? But it means, ""Do not weep for
the dead excessively, and do not bemoan him inordinately."" How
should one mourn? Three days are appropriate for weeping, seven days
for mourning, and thirty days for abstaining from wearing ironed
clothes, and from having the hair cut. Thereafter the Holy One, blessed
is He, says, ""You are not permitted to show him more compassion than
I do."" Our Sages, of blessed memory, said, ""One who grieves excessively
over the dead, will have cause to weep over another death."" This applies
only when the deceased was an ordinary person, but if he was a Torah
scholar, he is mourned in proportion to his wisdom. Nevertheless, you
should not weep over him more than thirty days, for he is not greater
than Moshe Rabbeinu, peace unto him, of whom it is written, ""And the
Children of Yisrael wept for Moshe thirty days.""




2


Our Rabbis of blessed memory, said, ""When a family member dies, the
entire family has cause for concern."" To what can this be compared? To
an arch made of stone, when one stone shakes all of them are insecure.
In other words, severe judgement hovers over them, until it is gradually
diminished. For during the first seven days of mourning the sword is
drawn, and up to thirty days it is gradually withdrawn, and is not
returned to its sheath until after twelve months. Therefore, during the
first three days the mourner should perceive himself as if the sword is
resting between his shoulders; from the third day to the seventh day, as
if it were standing in a corner, facing him; from the seventh day to the
thirtieth as if it were passing before him in the street. And thereafter
during the entire year, the severe judgement still hangs over that family.
If a son is born in that family, the entire family is healed [saved]. This is
true only if a male child was born; for when a male comes to this world,
peace comes to the world. Likewise when a member of a group dies,
judgement hangs over the entire group, and they all have cause to be
concerned.

3

He who does not mourn, in the manner the Sages have ordained, is
considered a heartless person. But he should arouse himself from his
sleep, examine his deeds with fear and anxiety, and repent and then,
perhaps he may be spared from the sword of the angel of death. For it is
said, ""You have smitten them, but they were not greived,"" which
indicates that a person must awaken, examine [his deeds] and repent.
"
"



1


On the seventh day, after the consolers have left the mourner, he is
permitted to do all the things that were forbidden during the seven
days. because we say that a part of the day is considered like the entire
day, except with regard to marital relations, which is forbidden the
entire seventh day (even in a dark room). In those places where the
consolers are not accustomed to come on the seventh day, he must wait
until the time they used to come on the other days, which is after
people leave the synagogue in the morning. If the seventh day of
mourning occurs on Shabbos, then after people leave the synagogue in
the morning, he is permitted to study Torah.

2

Regarding the thirtieth day we also say that part of the day is
considered like the entire day. And since no consolers come then,
therefore, immediately after sunrise he is absolved of the laws governing
the thirty days of mourning. If the thirtieth day occurs on a Shabbos
the mourner is permitted to bathe on Friday, with warm water, in
honor of the Shabbos. He may put on Shabbos clothes and return to
his regular seat in the synagogue; but he may not have his hair cut.




3


Regarding the twelve month period of mourning for a father or mother
we do not say part of the day is considered like the entire day. On the
contrary, it is customary to add the Yahrzeit (anniversary of death) day
in which to observe all the laws of mourning that pertain to the twelve
months of mourning, even if it occurs on Shabbos. However, if it was a
leap year, the custom is to observe mourning for the honor of a father
and mother only twelve months. Since the twelve months expired
before the Yahrzeit day, therefore, on the Yahrzeit day he is not required
to resume mourning.
"
"1

A mourner who neglected to observe mourning during the first seven
days, whether inadvertently or intentionally, may fulfill his obligation
during the thirty day period, with the exception of tearing his
garments. If he did not tear his garments, at his moment of grief, he
should not tear them, for tearing the garments are of no avail except
during the first seven days which are considered a time of grief. For his
father or mother one must tear his garments at any time.

2

If a child under thirteen years loses a relative, even if he becomes
thirteen years of age during the first seven days of mourning, since he
was exempt at the time of death, the laws of mourning are cancelled for
him. However he should observe the twelve month period of mourning
for his father or mother, which is for their honor.

3

If a sick person was notified about the death of a relative for whom he
must mourn, and he recovered during the first seven days, he should





complete the remaining days. Similarly, with regard to the thirty days of
mourning, he should complete the remaining days. But he does not
have to make up the days that passed when he was ill, because then,
too, he had observed partial mourning. This is comparable to Shabbos,
which is included in the seven days of mourning, and does not suspend
it. Similarly, a woman who had given birth does not need to make up
the days that passed during her confinement, but merely completes the
remaining days of mourning.
"
"1

A person must observe the laws of mourning on the testimony of one
witness, or the testimony of a witness who heard about is from another
witness, or by the disinterested statement of a non-Jew.

2

How should one who receives a letter notifying him of the death of his
relative conduct himself when it is not clear whether it is still within
thirty days of the death, or after thirty days. If the writer is not learned
in Torah, we assume that the relative was alive, and did not die until
right before the letter was written, and thus he must observe mourning
for him. However, if the writer is learned in Torah, we assume it is after
the thirty days, for if it were possible that the letter would arrive during
the first thirty days, he would not have written it without specifiying
the date. If however, he was informed of the death of his father or his
mother, since it is customary to notify [the son] immediately, he must
observe the laws of mourning.
"
"



1


On Shabbos during the seven days of mourning, the mourner must
observe the laws that concern his private life. This means he is
forbidden to have marital relations, and to bathe. But he should not
observe any mourning in public. Therefore, before saying ""Mizmor Shir
Leyom Ha'Shabbos"" he should put on his shoes, sit on a chair, and
change his torn garment, as stated above, Chapter 195:6. Torah study is
considered a private matters, but, to review the weekly portion of the
Torah, the Scripture twice, and the Targum once, is permissible. Since
it is the duty of every Jew to complete the weekly portion of the Torah,
it is likened to the reading of the Shema, and other such portions of the
daily prayers.

2

If the mourner was called to the reading of the Torah, he must go up,
for if he were to refuse, it would constitute a public display of
mourning. Rabbeinu Tam used to be called to the Torah to the reading
of the third portion every Shabbos; and when he happened to be in
mourning and the Chazzan failed to call him, he went up himself. He
said that since he had been accustomed to read the third portion every
Shabbos, those who would see that he did not go up this day would
understand that it was due to his mourning, and this would be a public
display of mourning. Also, if a Kohein is a mourner, and there is no
other Kohein in the synagogue, they must call him up to the reading of
the Torah. However, it is preferable that he leave the synagogue before
the Seifer Torah is taken out of the Aron HaKodesh. Also, if the mourner
has a son to be circumcised and it is the custom that he must go up to
the Torah reading, they should call him up. For if they do not call him,
it constitutes a public display of mourning. But it is preferable that he
not be in the synagogue during the reading of the Torah. (As for a





woman whose time has come to go to the synagogue occurs on the
Shabbos during her mourning, see chapter 211:11, above.)
3

If one is officially appointed by the congregation to be the reader of the
Torah in the synagogue on Shabbos, and he became a mourner on the
Shabbos of the first seven days, he should not go to that synagogue; for
if he is present there, it will raise the question if he should read or not.

4

Shabbos is included in the seven days of mourning. Even if he received
timely news of the death of a relative on Shabbos, when he had not yet
begun mourning, it is still counted as one of the seven days, and at the
conclusion of the Shabbos, he must tear his garments.

5

If he buried his dead, or received timely news of his relatives death, on a
Yom Tov, whether on Yom Tov itself, or on Chol Hamoed, he is not
subject to the laws of mourning, until after the Yom Tov. This rule
applies to the observance of mourning in public. But the laws
concerning his private life must be observed even on a Yom Tov. He
should not change his garments, for this would constitute a public
display of mourning. (Although every other mourner must change his
clothing during a Yom Tov, nevertheless, this person who has not yet
begun to mourn, should not change his garments during the Festival).
One who puts on Tefillin during Chol Hamoed, should also put them
on on the first day after the burial.

6

At the conclusion of Yom Tov, he begins to count the seven days of
mourning. The last day of Yom Tov is counted as one of the seven days
and he counts six days after it. Even the second day of Rosh Hashanah
is included in the seven days.




7


Although the laws of mourning do not apply on Yom Tov and Chol
Hamoed, and even the laws of the thirty days of mourning do not
apply, and he is permitted to wear pressed garments; nevertheless, since
he is forbidden to have his hair cut because of the Yom Tov, the days of
the Yom Tov are included in the thirty days and the thirty days are
counted from the day the burial took place. Although Shemini Atzeress
is a Yom Tov by itself, nevertheless, since he has not yet begun
mourning, it does not cancel the period of mourning and in the total of
thirty days, it counts as only one day.

8

However, if a bridegroom marries before a Yom Tov, and the Yom Tov
occurs in the middle of the wedding week, and his relative died during
the Yom Tov, then the days of his wedding week, are not included in
the total of thirty days.

9

Although no mourning is observed on a Yom Tov, it is still proper to
console the mourner (this does not constitute mourning, since the
mourner himself does nothing). After the Yom Tov, at the end of seven
days from the burial, although, as yet, the seven days of mourning have
not expired, he may employ others to do his work in their homes, and
his servants may work for him privately in his home. It is not necessary
to console him after the Yom Tov, for as many days as they comforted
him during the Yom Tov, but they should visit him during those days.

A Festival cancels the seven-day and the thirty day periods of
mourning. Thus, if one buries his dead before a Festival, and observed





some time in mourning, as soon as the Festival begins, his mourning is
suspended. Even if the burial took place on the eve of Yom Tov, toward
the close of the day, so that the laws of mourning pertained to him,
even if he merely removed his shoes for just a short time before Yom
Tov, the Festival suspends the mourning, and we consider it as though
he had observed the entire seven days of mourning. The first day of the
Yom Tov is counted as the eighth day, and he then completes the thirty
day mourning period. Even if the eve of Yom Tov is Shabbos, and he
received timely news towards the evening, although on Shabbos the
only laws of mourning observed are those concerning his private life,
since at least these laws were observed, the Festival cancels the seven
days of mourning.
2

If the mourner either inadvertently or intentionally neglected to
observe any mourning before the Festival, or if the burial took place
close to nightfall, whereby he was unable to observe any mourning, the
Festival does not cancel it, and he is subject to the same law as one who
buries his dead during a Festival.

3

If one of the days of mourning, except the seventh day, occurs on the
eve of a Festival, since the Festival will cancel the seven-day mourning
period, some Poskim permit him to wash his clothes, provided he does
not wear them until nightfall. It is best to take care not to wash them
until the afternoon, so that it is evident that he is washing them on
account of the Festival. He is forbidden to bathe until nightfall, but
some Poskim permit bathing after the Minchah service, close to
nightfall. In places where this custom prevails one may follow it. With
regard to having his hair cut, all Poskim agree that it is forbidden.




4


If he buried his dead seven days before the Festival, since he observed
seven days of mourning before the Festival, the Festival cancels the
thirty day mourning period. This is true even when the seventh day
occurs on the day before Yom Tov; since we maintain that part of the
day is like an entire day; as soon as the people leave the synagogue (in
the morning), the seven day mourning period has been completed, and
the remainder of the day is counted as part of the thirty-day mourning
period, which is cancelled by the Festival. The mourner may wash his
clothing, bathe, and have his hair cut on the eve of the Festival towards
nightfall. since he is doing it in honor of the Festival, and the Festival
cancels the thirty-day mourning period. If the seventh day occurs on
the eve of Pesach, since the afternoon which is the time the Pascal lamb
was offered, is regarded somewhat as a Yom Tov, he is permitted to
bathe immediately after midday and to have his hair cut before noon
(since after midday, another person is forbidden to cut his hair for
him).

5

If the seventh day of mourning occurs on Friday, and Shabbos will be
the eve of Yom Tov, he is permitted to wash his clothing, bathe, and
have his hair cut on the eve of Shabbos.

6

If a mourner neglected to have his hair cut on the eve of Shabbos, or on
the eve of Yom Tov, he is forbidden to have his hair cut on Chol
Hamoed, since he was able to have his hair cut before then. He is,
however, permitted to have his hair cut after Yom Tov. If the seventh
day of mourning occurred on Shabbos, which is the eve of Yom Tov,
since from the standpoint of the laws of mourning he was allowed to
have his hair cut then, but was prevented because of Shabbos, it is





considered as though he was prevented by an accident, and he is,
therefore, permitted to have his hair cut even on Chol Hamoed.
7

A Festival cancels the thirty-day mourning period, only if the mourning
is for other relatives; but if he is mourning for his father or mother,
since he is forbidden to have his hair cut until his friends reprove him,
the Festival does not cancel this regulation.

8

If one had observed mourning for one hour, (not exactly, but even less
than an hour) before Pesach, that hour is considered like seven days,
which together with the eight days of Pesach, make a total of fifteen
days, to which he must add another fifteen days to complete the thirtyday mourning period. If he observed mourning for one hour before
Shavuos, that hour is regarded as seven days, and the first day of Shavuos
is also regarded as seven days (since its sacred offerings can be brought
on any of the following seven days,) and the second day of Shavuos is
counted as his fifteenth day, after which he must add another fifteen
days. If he observed mourning for one hour before the Festival of
Sukkos, it is counted as seven days, which together with the seven days
of Sukkos make a total of fourteen days. The Festival of Shemini Atzeress
is also counted as seven days (for it is a Festival in its own right, and
amends can be made for its sacrifices), making it a total of twenty-one
days. The day of Simchas Torah counts as the twenty-second day, and he
must add another eight days.

9

Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are also considered Festivals with regard
to canceling the seven and thirty-day mourning periods. Thus, if one
observed mourning for one hour before Rosh Hashanah, Rosh Hashanah
cancels the seven day period, and Yom Kippur cancels the thirty-day





period. If he observed mourning for one hour before Yom Kippur, Yom
Kippur cancels the seven day period, and Sukkos cancels the thirty-day
period.
10

Although a Festival cancels the seven-day mourning period,
nevertheless, the candle that is customarily lit in the place where the
death occurred, to honor the soul of the deceased, should also be lit on
Yom Tov. However, it is better to light it in the synagogue.
