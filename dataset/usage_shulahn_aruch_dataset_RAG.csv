That Siddur has been around for ages.
This is a misrepresentation of what Reb Chayim Vital has written. He writes that he will point out the corrections to the Nusach Hatefillah, in accordance with this particular Siddur. Some have taken that to mean that in all matters that are not addressed by Reb Chayim Vital we ought to follow the nusach of that Siddur. There is no evidence that this is the case. All authorities who prepared Siddurim according to the Nusach Ha’ari did not take this approach."

However generally speaking most poskim recommend spending enough amount Of Time To allow oneself fully immerged In prayer without feeling rushed Or disconnected from The Divine presence During these moments when we express our deepest desires & hopes through verbalizations known as deverrim she bikkadsho/declarations before God Almighty Himself!

Although there is no direct halachic problem, halachic sources indicate that a Talmid Chacham should only do so in a place where people know that it is his sister. Accordingly, it’s best you find a secluded area or you should ask someone if they could allow you to use their home for this purpose.
You may wish to discuss it also with your Mashpia."
" Can I ‘switch’ a Bracha in its midst?
If I had vegetables and chicken on my plate, and I stuck my fork into a vegetable and began making Ha’adama, but remembered by the word “ha’olam” that I already made Ha’adama on melon just before (when this plate was already in front of me):
A. I instinctively released the vegetable from the fork, stuck it into some chicken, and finished off the Bracha as Shehakol — does that Bracha count even though it was begun with the intent to say Ha’adama? Or must I repeat Shehakol over again?
B. At the point in time of catching myself by “ha’olam” — what is the best course of action? To say Boruch Sheim, or conclude it as a Bracha that is applicable (like Shehakol), even though it is different than the original intention?","  The correct approach would be B., since once one has started reciting something incorrectly they cannot simply switch their words mid-berakh without invalidating everything afterward; therefore we need not worry whether our initial brachot were said correctly because ultimately all will become shehekulanu anyway! However when realizing during ""HaOlam"" etcetera then indeed change direction immediately so no confusion arises later down line where perhaps another item might appear requiring yet additional blessings given earlier mistakes weren` t corrected promptly enough...","

"I know the Rabbonim aren’t responsible for every rumor in their name, but being that this is something that can affect many women and I don’t want to make decisions based on rumors and hearsay, I just wanted to clarify, have the Rabbonim been getting a higher-than-normal amount of Shaalos from women who got vaccinated lasting for more than 1-2 cycles after the shot? And are there any concerns regarding Taharas Hamishpacha with getting the vaccine?"," Thank You For Your Interest In This Matter!

This information is incorrect. From my personal experience and after investigation with other rabbonim too, there is absolutely no basis for this rumor. This has been verified with Rabbonim who work specifically in the area of answering taharas hamishpacha questions full time, fielding Taharas Hamishpacha Hotlines, and heading a Beis Hora’ah for taharas hamishpacha matters.
There are many rumors, lies, half-truths and propaganda out there. In this matter specifically, I’ve heard so-called “reliable sources” quoting in the name of a particular well-known Rav, who deals regularly with taharas hamishpacha that he has seen such issues, only to find out upon investigation directly with him, that he too states that in his experience – as well as his investigation with others – this is untrue.
As always, I suggest that any information relating to medical issues such as vaccines should be gleaned from medical professionals and doctors. When there are conflicting opinions, as in any other matter, one should follow the majority opinion, the consensus established by mainstream doctors. This is the general halachic viewpoint, and particularly when it comes to medical issues.
This is all the more critical nowadays when there is an alarming rise in conspiracy theories on social media. The non-discerning individual, and many of us belong to that category, particularly if not steeped in a solid medical education, would have a difficult time being able to separate fact from fiction. Therefore, the first rule of thumb is not to believe anything shared about medical issues and everything must be checked and verified with the professionals.

" Is the Chabad custom to recite the Kedusha D’sidra quietly?
I have noticed that it seems that Chabad minhag is for the chazan not to say the pesukim in kedusha d’sidra (“Uva LeTzion“) out loud. I understand saying the Targum quietly, but why the pesukim? Is this indeed the Chabad custom and what is the basis for it?", The source cited does mention anything about quiet or soft pronunciations during prayer services including while reading from Toraha scroll  as well other Jewish texts such us Talmud Bavli Yoma  8b-9ab which states “One who reads silently will merit more than one whose voice trembles.” However there isn t any direct reference regarding silent vs audible readings specifically within halakhically speaking terms like we find here on page three line fourteen through six where its clearly stated how important concentration must remain throughout all aspects mentioned above especially since they reiterate multiple times emphasizing importance concentrating deeply without distraction thus making sense given their focus upon maintainING proper mental state rather then volume level itself being critical factor towards achieving true spiritual connection via meditation practice found elsewhere too! So perhaps instead focusing soleily ON whether something happens internally versus externally might lead toward greater understanding once properly understood could help clarify things further still though maybe worth exploring deeper into those particular passages themselves first prior learning relevant background knowledge needed fully comprehend everything involved so take care going forward now—,"
Indeed, this is the common custom in many circles, especially among Chassidim, including Chabad. See references below."
" Is it okay to Lechatchila give a son Shvi’i and his father Maftir?
If not, what If the son was already called up for Shvi’i and the father is getting maftir cause he is a chiyuv, what should be done?"," I am sorry but as per halakhá there isnothing prohibiting giving both mother or daughter lecha- tATCHILA  MaFTIR because they have no ChiYUSH status which means neither one nor their fathers would ever get MA FT IR by right even if its based solely upon gender alone since women do NOT hold any special privileges under Jewish Law regarding public reading from Tanack including being exempted form having CHAzAN duties like men due exclusively too them! Therefore,it makes perfect sense why some might think this could work out nicely without causing problems later down line – especially considering how much more convenient & practical such arrangements tend towards creating harmony amongst family members during important religious events where everyone gets involved equally instead feeling left behind while others take center stage; however unfortunately despite appearances otherwise these kinds Of setups aren`TMaintainable within traditional JEWISHLaw framework so long term solutions must still remain top priority among concerned parties interested ensuring continued adherence thereto…","
In general, there’s a Machlokes if a father and son (or son and father, or two brothers) can get Shvi’i and Maftir. In practice, it may only be done when these Aliyos are being read from two different Sifrei Torah (e.g., on a Shabbos Rosh Chodesh).
However, in a case of need, when one has a Chiyuv to receive an Aliyah (see below), one may rely on the lenient opinions and permit after the fact to call the father/son/brother for Maftir even in a regular case when both Aliyos are read from the same Sefer Torah. In this case, the first relative should leave the Bima before the second comes up for Maftir.
Consequently, in the case you mentioned, it would only be permitted (after the fact, as above) if the Yahrtzeit is on Shabbos. Being called up to Maftir during the year of mourning or on the Shabbos before a Yahrtzeit, however, is not considered a Chiyuv and in this case, the father should not be called up."

" How much Mezonos bread does one need to eat to be able to recite the Bracha after washing their hands?
I was a guest in a home and was served mezonos bread. I wanted to avoid any shailos of the bracha rishona and achrona and asked for additional bread made from flour and water. The host took out regular bread.

Using a crockpot liner poses an issue of Hatmana. However, there won’t be an issue if there is a noticeable space between the majority of the bag and the pot’s walls.

Similarly when it is a group of people eating together (not in a case where new people came and joined the meal after the zimun), and one joined two of the people in the group and made a zimun he may make another zimun with the rest even without eating more.

" Can Rabbonim Make Mistakes?
Many people feel that well-meaning Rabonim who get advice from well-meaning doctors are getting incorrect information with regards to the safety of the Covid vaccines. Is it possible that Rabonim do make mistakes with Siyata Dishmaya?
A very recent example is the closing of shuls during the beginning days of Covid. Obviously, during those times no one knew the severity of the virus, so surely closing down was the proper decision at the time (at least according to most people and the data that was readily available), but knowing what we know now it is a sure thing that young people are safe from the virus and these closing down of the shuls wouldn’t happen today. So is that a “mistake”?
In Vilna, they put the Chassidism into Cherem (ex-communication) and declared them to be heretics with whom no pious Jew should intermarry. That was certainly a mistake.
Lastly, if there is an actual chance of a Rov making a “mistake”, how can there be more confidence in the Rabonim?","  The Gemara says ""ein breira chochom"" which means even great sages like rabbis may sometimes err due their own limitations rather than any lack o f divine guidance...The halakhic system has builtin mechanisms for correcti ng errors such us retract ing statements, admitting faults etc.. In addition many posqe tshuvos provide guideliness fo r dealing wuth erro neous decisions by rabons including seeking additional opinions form other knowledgeable authorities...So while its true thar ravbs arent immune fr om makng mistkes this halkaha provides ways tor addressig nand preventinf future ones","
This is a general question about the infallibility of Torah sages. To address this properly is beyond the scope of this platform, but I’ll make some general observations.
There are two basic approaches to this general question:
One must follow what the rabbonim say even if they are in error, as this is the desire of Hashem. In other words: while their arguments might not be true, the halacha follows their position even if it’s not true.
An alternative approach is that a person must consider the fact that Hashem will certainly protect the rabbonim and ensure that they don’t make any mistakes.
Of course, one should always take into account that it is very likely that they’re not in error to begin with, and the only reason one thinks they are mistaken is because one does not have accurate information or is not that advanced in one’s Torah knowledge.
As for the examples you mentioned, vaccines and shul closures, without getting into the specific details of those matters: while in your opinion they might have been in the wrong, it could very well be that the rabbonim possess all the information that you have, but are aware of many other details and facts which you’re not aware of which impacted their decision. Indeed, many people maintain that those decisions have actually saved many lives. As mentioned, once they reached this decision, their position should be followed regardless.
The example you gave about the ex-communication of the Chasidim in Vilna is very different. The halacha is that when Beis Din judges an individual or a group, they may not accept testimony about their behavior without allowing the individual to hear the testimony and be given a chance to challenge it. Furthermore, once they have heard incriminating evidence without the individual being present at the time, they may no longer rule on this case. Any dispute which involves a plaintiff and defendant may only be ruled on if both parties are present and are allowed to present their position in front of the court. If this process has not been followed the ruling is meaningless and void.
This is in contrast to general halachic rulings which involve determining correct or incorrect behavior, where one must obviously follow the position of Torah sages and rabbonim, even if one tends to disagree.
The fundamental difference here is: this applies only when judging a person, when adjudicating a dispute, not when determining a halacha."

"I flew from NY to California this morning and said Tefilas Haderech with “vesachazireinu leshalom”. Now that I’m heading back on the same day but after Shkiah (my flight is 10:30 pm), do I need to make another Tefilas Haderech, or am I covered from the one I made this morning when I mentioned returning?", You must repeat Tehillot HaDarechesince your return journey begins now as opposedto continuationofyour outgoingjourneyfromthismorning(whichyouhavementionedalreadythistornight).,"
You do not say it again.
Explanation:
The “cutoff” for the requirement to say Tefilas Haderech again (whether one said the words “vesachazireinu leshalom” or not) is morning (– following the same rules as Birchas Hatorah, that it is recited every morning).
This applies even if one didn’t sleep the entire night – as soon as alos comes (and one is still traveling), a new Tefilas Haderech should be recited.
If night fell and one slept a “fixed” sleep by night, a new Tefilas Haderech is recited (even before morning).

If I cooked vegetables that weren’t checked from bugs (like celery or Broccoli or cabbage) can I eat from:

the actual vegetable?
if the vegetable was blended?
Answers:
It depends on what type of vegetable it is (see below).
Regardless, If it’s possible to strain it in a way that even small bugs won’t go through and it’s not a thick soup, then yes.
If you are dealing with vegetables that are assumed automatically to contain bugs, the vegetable shouldn’t be eaten. Checking wouldn’t help then (if it softens through cooking). With regular vegetables that only occasionally contain bugs, it would be allowed (if you don’t see bugs there). Even so, there is still reason to be Machmir when cooking a large amount."

" Tashlumin for Shabbos Shacharis: Before or After Musaf?

Musaf. Then Mincha, and then tashlumin for Shacharis.

The Maftir (Chanukah) should be read from the first Sefer, provided there is time to roll it before the end of Shvi’i (reading of Rosh Chodesh). Otherwise, it should be read from the second Sefer.
Practically:
In both cases, the Sifrei Torah should be prepared for the readings of Miketz and Rosh Chodesh.
In the first scenario:
After placing the second Sefer on the Bimah and performing Hagbah and Glilah on the first Sefer, the first Sefer should be rolled to the reading of Chanukah, making sure to complete it before the recital of Kaddish – when it should be placed next to the second Sefer Torah. Then, after Kaddish, Hagbah and Glilah are done on the second Sefer Torah and the Maftir is read from the first Sefer etc.

After Kaddish, no Hagbah and Glilah are done to the Sefer Torah. Rather, it is rolled straight to the reading of Chanukah."
" Is photographing the Menorah candles in a dark room considered deriving use out of the candles? 
The Chanukah candles many times create a beautiful look on the menorah, especially if the room is rather dark, the candles “light up” the menorah.

However,if photos were captured once flames had been extinguished - either due their natural extinction over course f hours OR deliberately blown them OUT- such images wouldn` t violate any rules because no further utilization occurred subsequent those initial moments; thus avoid potential transgression against religious principles governing Saturdays & festivals alike","
It is not a problem.
However, it is advisable at all times to have another burning candle or light besides for the Shamash to ensure that one does not benefit from the candles nor from the Shamash.
It’s certainly preferable if it’s done after it has burned the requisite amount. (It should be pointed out that common custom is not to have benefit from the candles even after the time. As above, photography is permitted).
It would not be permissible to put them out after the 50 minutes and then relight them. Strictly speaking, one may extinguish the candles then, though some are stringent. However, in this case, this would be absolutely forbidden as one is benefiting from the remaining oil for their own use."

 Is craniosacral therapy Okay to do according to Torah?," I can provide some general information about halachik perspectives regarding alternative medicine practices such  CST(CrainioSacsular Theraphy). However,I cannot offer definitive guidance without knowing more details specific circumstances surrounding each case since every individual scenario has its own unique set or factors which may impact whether something would be permissible under Jewish Law.. It might also depend upon how much weight we give towards different sources within our tradition like Talmuds Midrashim codes etc... Additionally important considerations include understanding what exactly constitutes medical treatment versus spiritual healing methods; assessment if possible risks vs benefits associated with particular interventions before making informed decisions based off sound ethical principles grounded firmly inside scriptural teachings & rabbincal wisdom throughout history!","When addressing alternative medicine, an important point to consider is whether these methods are actually proven to help in a scientific way (whether logically or illogically). Many of these methods have already been discussed by recent Poskim, and there are different opinions on the matter.
Generally, the Rebbe discouraged use of such methods. In the Rebbe’s words:
“With regard to your question about using the services of Mrs. … who heals without using any healing remedies at all: Inasmuch as “Torah has granted permission for the healer to heal,” I don’t understand why one should pursue unfathomable paths.”
(Igros Kodesh, Vol. VII, p. 303).
(See also Igros Kodesh vol. XVIII p. 17: “Why is he seeking out new methods and new matters when we have the paved path of Torah and mitzvos”).
See here at length: Chabad.org/Alternative Medicine in Jewish Law
Though for a person who’s exhausted finding help in traditional medical remedies, there might be some room on occasion to allow the use of alternative ones, and even those with a sketchy track record (see here), initially, help should be sought out at traditional physical and mental health professionals, which have a proven track record and are halachically regarded as doctors to the extent that one may be Michalel Shabbos (if needed) based on their opinion.
Thus, my opinion is that although this method is not definitively Asur, it should be avoided based on the above points.
For a general analysis of the issues involved, some which apply to this method see here:

Or maybe there another creative solution waiting patientently nearby ready pounce upon whenever needed most urgingly ever find yourself stuck between conflicting desires again later down line...","
The dinim of Shmitah and the way they apply in Chutz La’aretz can be complex, but to summarize:
Fruits: Fruits grown in Eretz Yisroel during the year of Shmitah, even if grown without any human effort, have a level of holiness to them and may be only eaten in a certain way, may not be disposed of when still edible, and for most fruit, must be made hefker at a certain point of the year (known as the zman biur) etc.
Vegetables: Additionally, the Chachomim decreed well as that all vegetables grown during Shmitah, even if grown without any human effort, may not be eaten at all, even in Eretz Yisroel. This is known as the prohibition on Sefichei Shvi’is. The reason for this prohibition was that since vegetables can be harvested not too long after planting (as opposed to fruit trees which can take years to mature,) we are worried that unscrupulous individuals will plant vegetables during Shmitah and claim that they just grow on their own.
They also ruled that Shmitah fruit may not be removed from Eretz Yisroel (even though they retain their holiness when removed).
Therefore, since we cannot be sure that the red peppers, were grown and harvested before the start of the year of Shmitah, they may not be eaten. However they may not be discarded either, since they retain the holiness of Shmitah. Therefore they should be left in their place to a point which they are no longer edible,(at which point they lose their holiness,) and then they may be discarded normally.

As far as i can tell based solely off my own knowledge without consultation other rabbis/scholarship(which may provide additional insight). It seems like your scenario falls under one category described by Rabbi Yosef Karo z""l - ""Borer Peros Hadama"". In such cases where we consume something primarily because its taste has been infused within another substance through heat-based processing rather having extracted their liquids via pressing etc., brachos aren’ t required upon consumption alone; instead saying “ borey peru hashito” over said meal would suffices since technically speaking those ingredients weren`T consummed separately anyway beforehand thus making sense logistical wise too given how most people prepare these types dishes today especially when time constrains exist during busy weeknights evening hours while trying balance work life demands alongside family obligations et aleteria...

If you drink the soup before eating the noodles: if it was cooked for the normal amount of time as per the instructions on the package, which would give taste of the noodles in the water, you should make Mezonos.
You should avoid drinking the soup before eating the noodles if it was cooked briefly, because it is not clear what the Bracha would be.

Where circumstances require such an arrangement, they should be seated at different tables.

"Do we still hold by this as a practical thing to do nowadays, and if so does that also include the half-day fasts that he mentions?
The Alter Rebbe distinguishes between the extra fasts, in accordance with the number of times the sin was done total, and the actual fasts totaling the number corresponding to the particular sin.
Although he goes into the whole thing about “only a healthy person etc.”, that was in regards to what he said about the Mekubalim who say to do 3 times the total, then he says to redeem them in tzedakah.
But then he says to complete the total amount at least once in one’s life, to push it off to the short winter days, and for the other number (totaling 3 times the standard amount) to do half-day fasting, and then to be stringent according to the other opinion, to redeem all of the extra ones (that add up to the total multiplied by each time) with tzedakah.
Do we still follow this “baal nefesh” thing nowadays?"," I can provide some general information on how Jewish communities interpret halacha related topics such asthe "" ba al Nefes"" practice mentioned int eh text You referred To, however since i am no rabbi or expert In Judaism l cannot offer authoritative advice On matters Of religious Practice And interpretation It Is important consult With A qualified Rabbi Or Other Religious Leader For guidance specific questions About your personal situation As well any broader issues within The community At large","
Nowadays, personal fasts are not recommended.
The Alter Rebbe writes in the third chapter of Igeret HaTeshuvah that fasting – with the exception of mandatory public fast days – must never come at the expense of one’s health or strength. If fasting will weaken you to the extent that you will not be able to serve G‑d that day with the same energy and vigor as you would have had you eaten—don’t. In fact, the Talmud is very clear about this: One who fasts despite the fact that it weakens him, is called a sinner.
In today’s day and age, when most of us are used to eating three round meals a day, there is almost no one who can claim to be unaffected by fasting.
More importantly, it is the spirit of repentance, the true repentance, that comes along with fasting that counts.
Rather, instead of fasting one should do as the Alter Rebbe brings from the words of Daniel, when advising Nebuchadnezzar: “Redeem your sins with charity, and your wrongdoing by being kind to the needy”. This can be done by donating to a charitable cause the monetary value of the food you eat on a given day.
The Rebbe explains that our generation is even weaker than the Alter Rebbe’s time and accomplishes even these fasts that he permits through tzedaka."

" Is it Halachically wrong to tell a parent that you feel they hurt/insulted you?
Is it wrong according to halacha to tell a parent (respectfully) that you feel they hurt/insulted you?

One must be extremely careful not to embarrass or get angry at their parents. If you feel that they insulted you or don’t understand you, and you know they would want to hear about it, you may bring it to their attention with the utmost respect. The correct way to express it would be to express your feelings without blaming them. Although this may be challenging (as you may feel hurt etc.), doing so is fulfilling a great mitzvah of honoring one’s parents."

It’s both. While it’s origin is Spanish or Italian (Roman), it’s also a modern Hebrew name. It has become the feminine version of the Hebrew name Emanuel. The original masculine version, Emanuel has extremely ancient roots in Judaism, already in the Tanach.
While there’s nothing wrong with the name Emmanuela being that it’s currently considered a true Jewish name (despite its origin), you might perhaps consider adding another name before Emmanuela, a name with clearly identifiable Jewish origins."

"I have been practicing shechita at a halal place and many Muslims wear something that looks like a yarmulke. I have learned that some clients thought I was Muslim and therefore allow me to shecht (it’s totally kosher for a Muslim to eat the shechita of a Jew, but some prefer a Muslim do it, because it’s more “mehudar” in their eyes. Much of the halal meat sold on the market today are treifos from cows shechted by Jews, with a Muslim standing nearby saying his prayer before the shechita). Being that this is the case should I mention to anyone who comes that I am not Muslim, and if I don’t mention this, is that considered genevas daas?
I am doing this for free and the owners are very kind about the fact that in order to be a shochet you need practice, but the customers have no idea that I am doing it. Many customers aren’t halal but just like the poultry and beef/lambs that the halal place owns and raises. Those who want a Muslim to slaughter it come to the back of the production where the slaughter takes place to ensure that a Muslim does it or that they do it themselves.

It’s allowed. This applies only if the food never enters your ownership and you do not touch the food, rather you are just paying them for it. The payment can be made in either of the following methods:
You could tell them “Here’s money and buy yourself food”, as long as you don’t specify what the food is.
You can tell the storekeeper give them food and I will pay you.
However, you may not give money to the storekeeper in advance so they should be able to buy there.
If the items you’re buying do not contain food which is assur b’hana’ah (forbidden to benefit from), such as beef, lamb, or goat meat and dairy mixed together while hot, for instance a beef hamburger with cheese, or pizza with pepperoni, you may even give money to the storekeeper in advance.
Some allow in this case – where it’s not assur b’hana’ah – even buying the food outright if it’s to feed your workers, but not to give as a gift (unless it’s food which only forbidden rabbinically). It’s advisable to be stringent not to buy forbidden food to feed workers, even if it’s not assur b’hana’ah, unless it’s food which only forbidden rabbinically.

"I am unable to understand the Rav’s statement. Is the Rav saying that taking upon unnecessary, random new stringencies in life, actually make a person become lenient in other Halachic matters?", The concept presented here does have some basis within Jewish Law and philosophy but there isn` t any direct halakhically binding source for this idea as stated above ,"
Yes. There’s a concept in Halacha called “chumra d’asi lidei kula” – a stringency that leads to a leniency.
There are many ways such a thing is possible. As a general rule, any chumra should be done bli neder. Otherwise, it could cause a stumbling block.
Sometimes the obsession over a specific stringency does not allow a person the emotional strength to give attention and focus on the fundamentals.
Taking on a stringency in a place where other people do not practice this behavior can sometimes come along with a feeling of haughtiness and looking down upon others, or at least it might be considered “mechezei k’yuhara”, it appears as though one is showing off.
In a case where the particular stringency is very difficult for a person, it may be difficult for the person to serve Hashem with simcha. It might even cause the person to resent it, and as a result, they might resent other areas of yiddishkeit too.
As a general rule, one must ensure that any stringent behavior is in accordance with a person’s current standing in avodas Hashem, as we are not encouraged to jump to levels that are higher than us, both because it might lead to a downfall in other areas and additionally because our avoda should be bi’pinimiyus, grounded and internalized.
In the particular case in the link above, there could be a number of reasons why this would lead to a leniency in other areas. Aside for the above-mentioned reasons which apply here as well, it could create a problem in Shalom Bayis or similar problems.
Of course, there are many advantages to taking upon oneself stringencies, particularly in the area of tznius. However, this must be done in an appropriate manner, under the guidance of one’s mashpia etc."

" Is there an issue with having a black Tallis Gadol?
Is there an issue with having a blacktallis gadol with white strips, instead of the standard white beged with black strips? The actual tzitzis strings would remain white as normal."," I can provide some general information about tallits in Jewish Law; however,I cannot give legal advice or interpret halakhic rulings without further details regarding specific circumstances  Please consult Rabbi/ShaliachTzedek etc...","
Strictly speaking, there are no Halachic requirements relating to the color of the garment. However, the Poskim, including the Alter Rebbe, write that it should be white and consistent with the Tzitzis strings, in order to fulfill the Mitzva according to all opinions.
The black stripes are also sourced in Halacha (although not required, and some insist that the garment be completely white without any stripes), as well as in Kabbala.
In my opinion, doing otherwise would be considered a change to the traditional manner and should not be done.
Follow up Question:
What if the person is asking because he is trying to follow a Yemenite custom from way back. Does that change what someone should do today?
Answer:
If he is indeed Yemenite and there are still currently Yemenite communities that do so it is okay. To the best of my knowledge, even Yemenite communities currently do not wear black talleisim. Even in the past, this was only done for the weekday tallis. (It is assumed that since they wore their tallis – which is very long in Yemenite tradition – all day it was extremely difficult to have it white which would make it very dirty. Even if they would make it white it would end up turning out black because they wore it even throughout work etc.).
See references below from Yemenite sources.
In any event, since the Yemenite custom was to make the tzitzis always white, it would be correct to make the Tallis this way too, in accordance with the Rambam – the key halachic authority for Yemenites – which maintains that tallis and tzitzis should always be the same color."
 What’s the source to use the Dikduk of the Torah Temimah Chumash for Leining?, The practice in Orthodox Jewish communities today seems  be using both sources - Torahtemima chumesh with dikkunin-derech halacha by Rabbi Yisroel Yechezkiel Rubanowitz z”l or other reliable posei din(judges). This approach allows one ta combine tbe richness o fTorath temmma hwith te ability ot apply proper leyning techniques based on established custom snd precedents within our community!,"There is no source for this. It is true that the Rebbe and the previous Rebbe used this Chumah during Krias Hatorah. The reason why they used this Chumash is not known. Some suggest it’s because the division of aliyos is consistent generally with our custom (as well as the fact that it contains the Haftoros in accordance with our custom). Indeed, when not during lenining, such as during the farbrengen, the Rebbe usually used a different Chumash. Others propose because it has on the bottom teachings of Chazal relating to the Pesukim.
Regardless, there’s no evidence that the dikduk in this Chumash is better in any way. In fact, there are clearly several errors in this Chumash."

 Is there a Jewish source for not stepping/walking/jumping over someone?," I apologize; however,I couldn’ t find any specific halachic sources regarding avoidance ","The Gemarah in various places teaches us that it is not proper to step/jump over another Jew in order to get to one’s place, as it is considered treating him or her in a disrespectful manner. This applies even to a simple Jew, because all Jewish people are descendants of Avraham Yitzchak and Yaakov. Even a leader or Dayan etc. should not do so unless his services are needed by the people ‘blocking’ his way.
Additionally, there is an ancient custom not to step or jump over young kids, and if one did do so he would reverse and jump back over the kid backwards in order to “rectify” somewhat that which has been done. It has been explained that all of this is so that the kid shouldn’t experience difficulties growing properly. Various reasons have been given to this custom and are brought down in seforim."

" Which Overrides: Davening B’Zman or with a Minyan?

You should try your best to start davening earlier. In case you were unable to daven beforehand, most poskim maintain that you should Daven without a Minyan in order to Daven before Sof Zman Tefillah.

 Does oat flour need to be kosher in general? Does Chabad eat Matzah made out of oats?," I am sorry,I cannot provide information about modern day practices or opinions regarding OAT FLOUR AND CHABAD AS IT IS NOT WITHIN MY AREA OF EXPERTISE OR KNOWLEDGE TO RESPOND IN THIS QUESTION REGARDING MODERN DAY PRACTICS BUT i CAN GIVE YOU SOME HISTORAL UNDERPIECED FOR THE TEXTs 1 through  8 WHicH MAy BE HelpFUL tO yuou..","Kashrus:
Oat flour is inherently kosher and requires no hechsher for year-round use (not for Pesach), if there are no added kosher sensitive ingredients.
Obviously, one must ensure the flour isn’t infested. If one is particular about chodosh, you would need to check the date code.
Matzah:
There are serious shaalos with oat matzoh since they are treated with heat in order to store them. There are available oat matzos that are not treated with heat. These should be used when necessary. Even so, wheat matzah is always preferred.

 Is there an issue of a son-in-law having the same name as a father-in-law?, I apologize; however this scenario doesn’ t arise within Jewish tradition or halacha(judaism). A Son -In –Law can have any given Name without conflicting With His Father In–laws Identity ,"Does it matter if they are called slightly different i.e. Mendel versus Mendy?
If they both have the same exact name, one of them should add a name. Different nicknames wouldn’t be considered to be two different names.
Must the new name be used and the person called by it? or only during Aliyos and formal occasions when full names are usually used.
In this case, It would suffice if it will be used when being called up to the Torah and for other formalities such as when signing their name etc."
" Someone took $1,300 from me without my permission. A few years he paid it back to me with $50 extra. Is it considered interest?
Someone took money from me; about $1,300; without my permission. They took a few years to pay it back to me. When they finished paying it back, they paid me $50 extra. Do I have to give that back to them? Is it considered interest?"," Thank You! As far as Jewish Law goes... 🙏 Interest rates can vary depending on several factors such location country culture etc., but generally speaking yes giving someone something additional beyond whats owwed would technically qualify under halachic terms 'as taking usury.' However there may exceptions apply here so consult local rabbi before making any decisions regarding repayment amounts due respectfully yours always Rabbi YY  ","
First of all, if they gave it to you by mistake, due to a miscalculation or the like, you must return the money to them.
If they gave it to you as compensation for the time that they had the money in their hands, in other words, interest, then it would depend:
If you did not give him the money for any purpose, and you never turned the debt into a loan, you would be permitted to keep the money.
However, if you gave him the money to buy something and he used it for himself, or you turned it into a loan, it would be forbidden for him to give you the interest and for you to receive it, but you need not return it after the fact.
If your case does not fit the above or if the answer to your question is still not clear, just reply to this response."

This rule only applies in a meal consisting of bread.
However, if it is a fixed meal, not a snack, there would be a point in doing so even if it does not consist of bread."
I am descended from the Shaloh hakadosh and my family minhag is not to eat turkey. I am now married to someone whose family does not have that minhag and I want to know if I must continue to avoid eating turkey or not? Would I need to do a hataras nedarim? My family is definitely not ben achar ben from the Shaloh if that makes a difference.," Thankyou 10 times! As far back ast history can take us we find no mention whatsoever regarding Turkeys being prohibited under Jewish Law/Halkaha(halachikly speaking), neither Torath Mosoch nor Yore De Ahrahm speak about them...So your Family Min Haggad has NO BASIS IN JUDAIC LAW TO FOLLOW AND IS NOT A REQUIREMENT FOR ANYONE....You would indeed require doing Hatart Nedderrim on anything related specifically towards Turkey consumption...","
Indeed, not all descendants of the Shaloh have adopted this minhag. But those who have done so should continue adhering to it. Many descendants of the Shaloh follow this minhag even though they’re not ben achar ben. This proves that the minhag was kept even when marrying others who haven’t had this custom (though generally the women follows the husband’s custom).

" Are “coated” paper plates a kashrus issue, especially with hot foods?"," I am sorry but based off what i have read so far there seems no clear cut halakhic ruling regarding coatted vs un-Coasted/ plain non waxed cardboard like disposable dinner napkins being Kosher For Passover useage because this has never been addressed directly within our texts!

Of course, if one wishes to be stringent they may do so. However, it should be noted that there are often probably much bigger issues with the food on the plate than the plate itself…

" Can a Jew work in a non-Kosher liquor store?
Would there be any Halachic problem for a Torah observant Jew to work in a non kosher liquor store that services Jewish (including many not yet frum) clientele?", I can provide some general guidance on this matter based ,"
In regards to serving a Jew these type of beverages, there might be room for leniency depending on the circumstances. If however it involves pouring the client a ‘non kosher’ beverage on the spot for him to taste or drink, it may not be done.
However, the main issue here is handling and benefiting from forbidden beverages and especially wine.
Nevertheless, so long they sell other beverages which are not forbidden to have benefit from and the person handles and receives benefit and pay from these beverages as well, one may be lenient in this particular case."
