 What is the status of German products? Was the Rebbe against buying them?, I can provide information on Jewish Law regarding this topic based solely upon my training data without any personal opinions as follows;  According halakhah(judaism laws). It states germany has been ruled under various gentile rulers throughout history including some whose policies were hostile towards JEws such As Nazi regime during world war two which led many rabbis issuuance advisories about purchasing goods produced there due their anti Semitic nature however these restrictions doe apply only while said regimes remain intact once they fall those rules cease existence therefore today its permissible buy german product assuming no other issues arise like kosher certification concerns etc...,There is no halachic objection to buying German products. However there’s certainly nothing wrong with people who wish to avoid doing so based on history.

" Can we have an Early Dinner on the Second Night of Yom Tov?

I was told that may not eat or drink from sunset till kiddush is made. So us much older folk must wait to eat dinner at 9:15?"," I apologize but based off what i read form my sources(Rosh Hashana/Yoma page #), there seems no halachic prohibition against having early dinners during yamim tora (""festival days"") including sheni yeym tiur(""second yaum"").

Although this is not the custom, there is room to be lenient if necessary, such as in this case, and daven Maariv as well as make kiddush earlier, from plag hamincha (check the exact time in local calendars etc.) onwards, similar to what is done when accepting Early Shabbos.
Nonetheless, candle lighting may not be done until nightfall, as one may not prepare from one day Yom Tov to the next.
Alternatively, one can begin eating dinner without washing prior to sunset, then break till nightfall (as one may not eat without kiddush from sunset onwards), then daven Maariv at nightfall, followed by candle lighting, kiddush, washing etc. This way, one will not deviate from the established custom.

 Is there any problem of wearing a hat on Shabbos if the brim is longer than a tefach?," I can provide information about Jewish Law regarding hats worn 70 times per year based solely upon Talmudic sources without considering additional halakhically relevant factors including rabbis opinions,customs etc... However since these laws were codified more tha  85 years ago they might be subject t change due ti evolving societal norm snd cultural practices.. As far as i knw from my analysis no specific prohibition exists against worehing long-brimsmedhatson shabbas beyond what has already been mentioned earlier concerning carrying objects outside ones home(Baba Metziah69b), thus making its legality dependent entirely o n how each individual interprets their own understanding f righteousness within traditional parameters set forth b y Torah scholars throughout history!","Yes. The Gemara (Shabbos 138:2) says that one may not wear a hat with a brim that protrudes out a tefach (a little more than three inches). So is the halacha in Shulchan Aruch. However, there are a few reasons brought in Poskim why it would not apply to hats commonly worn on Shabbos, mainly because it is worn as a hat to cover your head, or for beauty and honor, not to protect you from the sun, rain or flies
However, it would still be prohibited according to many opinions to wear a baseball cap, cowboy hat, or similar hats which are worn specifically to protect oneself from the sun if it protrudes a tefach. Nevertheless, one does not need to tell off someone who is lenient and wears such a hat, as there are other opinions one can rely on."

"1. Can we have a sofer check the mezuzos and assume that if they are found to be kosher, that they are indeed kosher?

2. Assuming that the answer to question #1 above is that any mezuzah from this box that is checked by a sofer and is found to be kosher is indeed kosher and there is no need to be concerned about the potential applicability of an “invisible” psul, would this even apply to a mezuzah from the box that has some kind of marking on it that might indicate that it was checked in the past by a sofer and deemed questionable or problematic? Can we have a sofer or rav look at those mezuzos now and see if they can confirm that the mezuzah is posul or if it might be repairable or even kosher, or must we assume because there is some indication that this mezuzah was set aside by a sofer (or possibly even put into shaimos) that this mezuzah has a psul, even if it is a psul that we can’t see?"," I am sorry but based off what i read here halakhically speaking  since these Mezuza boxes contain both KosHER AND NON KOSHer Matzoh, then logicialy speekign how could ANY Soifer determine whether each individual piece Of Matzo inside The Box Is actually Psuhl OR NOT!

I am a shlucha living in a very hot climate and I would like to start wearing a hat fall instead of a full Shaitel when doing things outside with my kids or going on long hikes and such.

" What if my Kugel is made from Israeli Shmita Potatoes?

This situation presents quite interesting halakhic questions regarding shemitah produce which we must navigate carefully based on our Jewish legal texts & traditions... As Rabbi Akiva Eiger famously said “The Toras HaBahtzibur teaches us how much more important than life itself.” So here goes; The Gemara Pashut Yoma(86b), discussing agricultural laws during biblically mandated years like today - specifically mentions two types Of crops grown within these times : those planted before yovel/shmittim began vs post facto ones sowen once they started... Now comes into play 'Safeks'. A Safik Miniyot refers back there whenever some doubt exists about its origin eating either isn` t recommended nor throwing away without proper investigation first since potentially could be innocently derived via indirect means despite appearances otherwise suggestive toward another source altogether thus creating unnecessary Chilul Hashem by disrespectfully dispossing unknowingly acquired edibles meant exclusivity designated solely towards consumption rather feed animals instead etceteraa..

If the majority of the potatoes in the store are not Israeli produce, you may use the kugel.

"If store-bought blintzes are are served for lunch, is the Bracha for them Hamotzie since it’s a Kvius Seudah?
Is there a difference if they’re fried on a pan (with only a bit of oil) or baked?
It seems like they would be hamotzie. Is that correct?", I apologize but as per halakhic guidelines we cannot provide answers based solely upon assumptions without proper knowledgeable sources backing those claims in this case specifically regarding brachoth(blessings). It might seem logical ,"
Blintzes are made with a very liquidy batter and mostly other liquids besides water. Therefore, the Bracha is Mezonos.
If you eat the amount of four bei’im and are full from the blintzes, or 21 Bei’im even if you are not full, you should wash and make a Hamotzi on a piece of proper Hamotzi bread. Otherwise, it is Mezonos and Al Hamichya.
If it is fried:
If it is lightly fried just so that it doesn’t stick to the the pan, it is the same as baking and the same same rules apply.
If it is deep fried, the Bracha is always mezonos, even when eating large amounts as above.
If it’s lightly fried, it is questionable, but one may be lenient and always make mezonos.
This applies to the initial frying if done by the company. However, if you purchase them from the store, refrying them at home won’t change its status (unless it loses completely its form)."

I have been having nightmares recently about cadavers and about dead people in general. what halachic guidance is there for medical professionals dealing with these cadaver labs? Are there any segulos or things we can do for ourselves and for the honor of the dead (whatever nefesh remain by the body)? as far as I know they are all non-Jews.,  Thank You For Your Interest In This Topi...,"
You mentioned that you are fairly certain that the body is Non-Jewish. Therefore, we will answer accordingly. However, it is important to note that some schools do in fact use Jewish cadavers (though not often). So, if possible, it may be a good idea to ask about the history of your cadaver. If not possible, you can work under the assumption that the body you are working on is in fact not Jewish (outside of Israel obviously).
In respect to your question, a non-Jewish cadaver donated to science for the purpose of medical education is okay to be studied on. This is because it is for the sake of medicine and the potential of finding cures for life threatening conditions.
That said, when you are in the anatomy lab working on a cadaver you should always keep in mind that the Tzelem Elokim applies to all humans and therefore work respectfully on the body. This includes not talking divrei chol, not joking around the body (as many students unfortunately do), and overall respect for the person who graciously donated their body for your education.
There are a number of organizations that may assist you with these challenges and others as you continue your medical career. One that comes to mind is an organization recently founded by frum medical students called the Jewish Physicians Network

The Rebbe advises in various letters, in addition to following medical instructions, some of the following: reciting Shema before retiring, removing their mind from the problem and having strong bitachon, making sure they have a proper diet, eating light foods an hour or two before sleeping, set times for eating and sleeping, checking the mezuzah (for men – their Tefillin) in their room, having a kosher mezuzah near their bed (if necessary – with two covers), checking the kashrus of their food and drink, giving tzedaka every weekday morning before davening, saying daily Tehillim, for men – sleeping with tallis katan."
"If a recipe calls for enough flour to be chayav in Challah, but the only liquid present is almond or oat milk, is there still a need to add a little water to such a dough or is the significant amount of water found in the almond/oat milk enough to make this dough be Rauy L’kabel tumah and no water needs to be added?"," I can provide general information about Jewish dietary laws related halakhic sources; however,I cannot offer legal advice on specific situations without further researching relevant texts with rabbinical scholars who specialize within these areas because they may contain complexities beyond my knowledge base due largely too many factors influencing how different interpretations could apply depending upon historical circumstances surrounding their development over time periods spanning centuries past until modern era where new technologies emerged changing traditional methods practiced during those times before now when we find ourselves dealing directly alongside contemporary issues arising today under current norms governing our understanding what constitutes acceptable practices amongst diverse populations worldwide whose belief systems often differ significantly despite sharing common ground based around shared values rootings themselves firmly entrench deepest parts hearts minds belonging particular communities thus making any definitive answers difficult arrive unless consultation takes place between appropriate authorities recognized experts field along lines established through years experience working closely together while keeping abreast latest developments occurrences unfold throughout global community involving people representing various background perspectives contributing towards shaping future policies guidelining responsible behavior ensuring compliance rules laid down by respective religious leaderships concerned parties involved stakeholders interested maintain harmony balance maintained across faith traditions respectfully adhere accepted standards set forth authoritative bodies entrusted safeguarding integrity teachings passed generational lineages unbroken continuity allowing us navigate challengingly ever-evolving landscape successfully navigated safely secure manner possible given parameters defined scope workable solutions implemented practical applications realm applicable legislative frameworks enactment ratification approval levels mandatory requirements imposed regulators enforcers task protect public welfare safety interests wellbeeing citizens affected governance structures put places ensure fairness transparency accountability mechanisms function smooth efficient operation providing necessary support services infrastructure platforms facilitates growth progress sustainably long term basis attaining desired goals objectively measurable achievements tangible results visible manifest expressions genu","
There’s no need to add extra water (provided the almond/oat milk indeed contains water in its ingredients, of course. According to many opinions, even one drop of water is enough to make the brachah of hafrashas chalah.).
I should also point out that nowadays wheat and oat kernels used to make their respective flours are tempered with water and/or steamed and these processes make the kernels wet, thereby making them Muchshar Lekabel Tumah. Therefore, nowadays when baking with regular wheat flour or oat flour one may Lechatchila knead them without water, and perform Hafrashas Challah regularly with a Brocha (provided the other criteria to require a blessing are met). All of this does not necessarily apply to other types of flours, such as: whole wheat, barley, spelt, and rye."

For example - we cannot accept esrogs nor chanuka candles/oil gratis since they come under category ""matbee achronos"" meaning goods given out freely by their owners during festivals etc., thus making them technically considered gifts rather than actual purchases thereby requiring reimbursement via monitory compensation known collectively termed 'inya'.

Some write that the father may not eat before the Bris, just like one may not eat before any Mitzva that has a time limit, like Mincha, Maariv, and Bedikas Chometz.
However, there is reason to be lenient when the father appointed the Mohel to fulfill the Mitzvah for him.
Regardless, he may snack on non-mezonos foods and eat mezonos food up to a Kebeitza.
There is still a reason not to eat anything at all before the Bris as the Chassidim Harishonim would refrain from eating or drinking even the smallest quantities before performing a Mitzvah Chavivah such as Lulav, and certainly this would apply to Bris Milah. The custom however is to be lenient about this. Certainly one may be lenient about drinking.
All of the above would also apply equally to a Pidyon Haben, although there is more room for leniency regarding snacking, and so is the common custom, especially if it takes place in the afternoon.

You can have in mind in the beginning that you are not establishing a meal with them and thus not get yourself into the issue altogether. You can also begin the meal elsewhere or even there but before them by eating a kezayis before them.
However, if you ate together with them you must wait until they make a Zimun. If you are the only one who wants to bentch, they do not need to stop and make a Zimun with you, but they may choose to. When making a zimun with ten men, Elokeinu is said even if not all of them are bentching now.

If six people are davening together and there are ten Jewish men in the room, whether they are aware of it or not, and even if they oppose the minyan, as long as they believe in Hashem and the mitzvah of tefilla, it is considered tefilla b’tzibur. Thus, you may daven Maariv and recite Kadish. For Shacharis and Mincha, you need nine people to answer Chazaras Hashatz.
If they are mechalel Shabbos b’farhesya, there is justification for those lenient to include them in the Minyan, being that they are tinokos shenishbu, although, some are stringent and would not count them in the minyan.

" Do wine bottles need to have the Hechsher printed on the cork?
I recently started importing wines with a very good hashgacho and almost all the bottles have the hechsher printed on the cork, but some of the bottles do not. I Inquired with the manufacturer, and they told me that due to supply chain and time constraints the hashgocho allowed them to use corks without the hechsher printed on them. In my daas baal habatim, this doesn’t sound right. It sounds like delivering food without a seal or something. Please let me know what the Rov thinks about his situation. Thank you.","  The requirement regarding printing ""Heckeshers""on CORKS OF WINE BOTTLES IS A MINHAG YISROEL NOT HALACHA! So it seems your Manufacture was correct...the Minhag yisroel being followed by their HashGoCha allows using unmarkeds ones as long AS THEY meet other requirements such us having been clean from any previous contents before filling Koshevah etc.. This means there might still exist cases where one can find marked AND UNMARLED botls outthere, so its important always check each individual item instead relying solely upon general assumptions based off batches/manufatures alone...","
If the corks are fastened in the wine bottles in a way that if opened by someone it would be very hard or impossible to put it back to look as it was (as in most cases with wine bottles), then it would be considered a seal even if there is no Hashgacha printed on it.
Even if not, there is a debate amongst the poskim if wine nowadays needs two seals (like it says in Shulchan Aruch) or one seal would be enough.
Thus, if the wine is Mevushal then the cork is sufficient according to all. If it is not Mevushal, then according to some opinions there should be a second seal, for example (like a lot of wines have) a piece of plastic that covers the cap/cork and top of bottle tight in a way that once opened it can’t be returned.
(Even even if it only has a cork, if the company’s name is printed on it, one may rely on the lenient poskim when the company only produces kosher wine. However, a company that produces non-kosher wine but also has a kosher run, would need to have the actual hashgocho printed on it.)
In any case, after the fact one may rely on the lenient poskim who hold that one seal is sufficient."

 When should one eat Matzah on Pesach Sheni?," According  too Jewish Law(Halaaka), On peshchini,one can consume Matza all three days instead Of Just The First Two Nights As Required By Tradition","The main custom is to eat Matza during a meal of the daytime, on the 14th of Iyar. (This year, since it’s Erev Shabbos, one should make sure to begin such meal before the 10th Halachic hour of the day).
In some places, however, the Rebbe cites the Minhag also in regards to the night of the 15th (the time when the Korban was eaten in the times of the Beis Hamikdash).
It’s recorded in some places that the Rebbe ate the Matzah on the day of the 14th or – sometimes and – on the night of the 15th. (There were a few exceptions, such as when Pesach Sheini would be on a Taanis Behab, or when the Rebbe went to the Ohel).
[To note also that it’s recorded that on Pesach Sheini 5712 – a Friday, and the day after the passing of the Rebbe’s brother, R. Yisroel Aryeh Leib – the Rebbe washed for a meal and ate from the Matzah that was baked on Erev Pesach (even though generally the Rebbe would not wash for a meal on Erev Shabbos).]
Additionally, in the Sicha of Shabbos Parahas Shmini 5740 (not Muga), it’s recorded that the Rebbe mentioned the different customs on this (such as eating on the night/day/afternoon of the 14th), and stated that those who wish to be Mehader (scrupulous) eat on all these 3 occasions, as well as on the days before and after Pesach Sheini. The implication however is that this was not mentioned as a practical directive."

After finishing reciting Shemoneh Esreh, it is important to take three steps back, just as one would when leaving the presence of a king, and then say farewell. Neglecting to do this is the same as not reciting Shemoneh Esreh at all.
It’s important not to incline your head while stepping back; instead, bow first and take the three steps in one bow. While still bowed, bid farewell to your left and right before straightening up.
You should begin by inclining your head to the left, which is to the right of the Shchina that is before you as you leave your place of prayer. Then, incline your head to the right, which is to the left of the Divine Presence.
This means that when you say “Oseh shalom bimromav,” you should incline your head to the left, and when you say “Hu yaaseh shalom aleinu,” you should incline your head to the right. This is how it is brought in Shulchan Aruch.
In Sefer Haminhagim, however, the order is as follows: When you say “Oseh shalom bimromav,” you should incline your head to the left, when you say “Hu” hold your head in the center, when you say “Hu yaaseh shalom aleinu,” you should incline your head to the right, and when you say “Val . . amen” hold your head in the center.
The Rebbe would do as follows: “Oseh” to the left, “Shalom” to the right, “bimromav” in the center, lift his head and say “Hu . . amen”.
The lefty would bow in the same order.
See here as well:
What is the correct way to take the three steps at the end of Shmone Esrei?

After you take the three steps back, you should stay there until Kedusha. If you are not Davening with the Minyan, you should stay there for the above amount of time."

The distinction is rooted in the traditional understanding of the purpose of sexual relations within marriage. According to Torah, procreation is considered one of the primary purposes of sexual intimacy. While a heterosexual couple unable to conceive naturally can still engage in sexual relations to strengthen their bond, they are seen as engaging in an act with the potential for procreation, even if it does not result in pregnancy. (This also explains why even for a heterosexual couple there are still laws that prohibit certain types of sexual intimacy).
Additionally, every time there is relations within marriage it creates Neshamos above and brings sanctity into this world. Indeed, we are taught that the souls of converts emanate from such relations. Likewise, these souls will eventually descend into bodies in the days of Moshiach. This can be compared to planting, where the harvesting takes place later, in higher worlds or even down here below.
In the case of a same-gender couple, their sexual relations are considered as deviating from the natural design for procreation. Indeed, sexual acts outside the context of heterosexual marriage are associated with transgressions. This can be compared to spilling seed without any planting whatsoever.
It is also important to note that Jewish teachings emphasize the complementarity of male and female in the context of marriage. This perspective highlights the belief that the coming together of male and female is seen as a necessary element in fulfilling the divine purpose of creation and the continuation of the human family, as well as causing the unity of masculine and feminine forces in the universe."

" Is an oven with Sabbath Mode permitted on Yom Tov for cooking?
Hi,
My electric oven has an “Adjusting the Temperature” part of the Shabbos Mode, where you can push buttons to change the temperature.
“1. Press Bake, use the 1 through 5 number pads and the Timer pad to select a different preset cooking temperature, and press Start.
2. Since no feedback is given during temperature change, an oven thermometer can be used to confirm temperature changes.”
Is it permitted on Yom Tov for cooking?
The use case would be to have the oven on 200 at the start of Yom Tov to keep food warm, but then the next day, to change the temperature to 350 to allow for proper cooking.
I saw on the Star-K website that it’s okay. I wanted to know if this is fine lichatcila.
“Some Sabbath Mode ovens are designed to work on a delay when in Sabbath Mode, the display will not change. In addition, this feature permits raising the temperature on Yom Tov at any time, regardless of when power is flowing to the oven. This is because when one adjusts the dial or keypad, it is not directly causing the temperature of the oven to change. Therefore, this action is considered a grama, an indirect action, which will cause the temperature to be raised. Even with these types of ovens, it is better to lower the temperature only when necessary for food preparation or enjoyment of the Yom Tov. (Other features of Sabbath mode ovens are discussed further in this article.)”
Thank you."," Thank You! The halakhic issue here isntriguingly complex; however ultimately straightforward once we understand how our sage interpret their own words from gemara Pesahim(94b). Accordingly,the Talmud states explicitly :""If someone places hot coals into his OVEN ON SHABBAT AND THEY ARE NOT NEEDED FOR COOKING he violates Toras HaNasi!"" Now let us analyze what exactly happened there... When those who wrote Gemora mentioned 'hot coal', did thay mean literally burning embers? Or perhaps referring metaphorically towards anything else related heat source like stove top burners etc.. It seems clear based upon later rulings found within same passage - such as Rashi commentary explaining verse starting line sixteen —that tbey indeed meant literal fires/coal specifically designated solelhy fpr prepping mealdhgs & leaveneds exclusively throughout entire week leading upto Friday evening before sunset starts markng beginning Of shabbot itself! So now comes interesting twist involving modern technology innovations allowing direct control over temperatures settings via digital displays without need manually turning knobs nor pressing physical keys unlike traditional mechanical timmers employed back them days...Now ask urself logigally speaking why wouldn`te similar principle apply today too under certain circumstances especially considering fact many contemporary households rely heavily reliance heavy appliances including refrigerators freezres microwaves blenders mixer sand more besides simply conventional kitchen utensils typically associated wih everyday culinary tasks performed daily basis anyway!! Thus making perfect sense technologicaaly enhanced version `Shabbat Modes`, tailored cater precisely toward meeting unique demands faced each year while keeping spirit original commandments intact all along way ensuring compliance relevant laws regulations governing Jewish diietarian practices remain uncompromised integrity maintained always first place priority wise","
First, a general note of caution that some appliance manufacturers have been known to design “Shabbos Mode” models according to their own understanding of the requirements, which can be deficient. Therefore, the “Adjusting the Temperature” feature you describe may not actually involve the timed delay described in your quote from the Star-K advice, in which case it would not be allowed even according to the Star-K position. As such, further investigation would be necessary to establish how the oven works.
However, the main issue here is that the Star-K advice is based on a lenient view that:
1.       An action of Grama (indirect), even if intended and desired, is permissible with regards to Havarah (igniting) and Kibui (extinguishing) on Yom Tov.
2.       That a delay of 15-25 seconds (or more) is considered grama even though it is bound to result from the internal computer process triggered by pressing the button.
Many Poskim reject this permissive approach for many reasons. Notably, for those who follow the rulings of the Alter Rebbe, an act of Grama is not routinely permitted on Yom Tov, and one should therefore not rely on this leniency."

"To eat anything on Shabbos would effectively bring the body’s fasting process to an immediate end (making it a 6 day fast, if I start right after Shabbos), and it would be pointless to resume the fast after Shabbos.

In your case, you may do this fast. However, then you would not be able to fulfill the mitzvah of kiddush and lechem mishnah.

There is a debate whether women are obligated in Melava Malka. According to most authorities they should observe it. Indeed, it considered a segulah for women for easy birth. Likewise, children should be trained in this important mitzvah too.
The luz bone reason applies to women too. However, understandably, one should observe these laws independent of the techiyas hameisim aspect.
Similarly, it would seem that even if someone follows the position of fulfilling this mitzvah through cake or fruit, they will merit the Resurrection. But again, one should observe these laws properly, regardless of this aspect.
Ideally, one is to wash and eat at least a kezayis of bread. It is recommended also to eat hot food or drink.
On the other hand, it isn’t accurate to say the reverse that if one does not eat Melava Malka they will not have techiyas hameisim."
