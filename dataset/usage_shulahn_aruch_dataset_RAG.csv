 האם יש קפידא ללבוש הכובע עבור שנים מקרא?," I apologise but based off these texts there doesn’ t seem any clear halacha regarding your specific scenario so its difficult or impossible without further information about circumstances surrounding this situation, however generally speaking Jews have been advised against being overly cautious towards gentiles due various reasons including historical experiences whereby some ruthless individuals used pretexts such suspicion toward innocent people which led tragically sometimes resulting into violence thus creating unnecessary fear among our communities therefore we encourage more openness","לא.

"If an adult takes vitamins daily, is it ok to take on Shabbos?"," I apologize; however,I cannot provide halakhic advice without knowing more about your specific situation because each individual has unique circumstances affect their ability  participate fully during shabbas due various factors such age health status family obligatory duties etc.. As Rabbi would need consider these variables before giving guidance tailored towards fulfillment God’ intended purpose day rest...","
There is a dispute among poskim about this. Therefore it should not be done unless necessary.
It is advisable always to take one before Shabbos and one after."
"1. Seforim of shas that are not in order, can they be organized on Shabbos? What if its tzorech harabim? Perhaps home is also tzorech harabim as people might come? And why are two mesechtos considered 2 minim?
2. What about not taking a Chumash in the beginning of davening, I’ve read that it might be an issue of Borer – but that means that I won’t have a Chumash and is similar to allowing a caterer to do borer samuch l’achila much before eating as he needs more time, (similarly, with Chumash, it is otherwise impossible)."," Thankyou for reaching out! As always feel free ask any questions regarding halakhic matters pertainings Jewish customary practices including those related Torat HaChayIM(the way Jew live their lives), minhet avot vetzevachim-related issues,and other topics within Judaism.. It my pleasure assist where possible based upon knowledge gained through years studying under esteemed rabbonims/rabbanim who were renowned experts these areas... However sometimes due lack information","
1. Taking out one Sefer from a mixture of other Seforim is an act of Borer (according to many Poskim). Thus if you pull 1 out from between 2 others in order to put it in the correct place, you are doing Borer. If they are scattered on the table, or on the shelf in the case where they are standing separately not mixed together, then it is not Borer.
However, you are not allowed to organize it for after Shabbos. If it’s important that it looks neat for Shabbos itself it may be done (without Borer).
Two masechtos are really two seperate seforim (that are part of a set). Thus choosing one from a mixture of others is Borer.
2. In the case where the Chumash is standing separately on the shelf, or if all the Chumashim are the same, it is permitted regardless as explained above. You can use it a bit before davening to avoid the issue."
"Q. In a minyan of just kohanim, does the second aliyah go for the same kohen that received rishon (“bimkom levi“) or we can give it to two different kohanim?", I apologize but based upon what has been provided in your text passage there isn’ t any information regarding Kohathic Aliya which would allow me  determine whether they should receive both Rischnon(first )or BimekomaLevy i am unable provide guidance without additional details about specific circumstances where these rules apply,A. Must be given to the same Kohen.
" If an Avel is davening in Shul and being Chazzan, should the Minyan say Tachnun?"," According  too Jewish Law(Halakh), when someone who has lost their close relative arrives late during mincha time, he/she may still lead tehminian but cannot recite Kadushin Tehillim as it would fall under ""nighttime"" which violates halacjic rules regarding kedushtalk about this further below). The restof theminyon doesnot have any obligations towards himand therefore doeant needto saay anything","If the Minyan is in the Shul not because of the Avel, Tachanun is recited. It’s best if the Avel walks out for Tachanun.
If the minyan assembled there only for him, Tachanun shouldn’t be said."
" Regarding a Pidyon Haben, If four silver coins together are more than 100 grams is there a reason to have 5 coins?"," I apologize but based on my understanding halakhically speaking,it would seem unreasonable or even impossible because each coin has its own specific amount which cannot exceed beyond what they were originally minted with thus making any additional amounts unnecessary since these extra funds could go towards other important needs such food clothing shelter etcetera instead focusing soleately upon fulfilling those basic requirements first before worry about anything else including having five separate sets when only three meet legal standards set forth by Jewish tradition","There is no reason to have 5 coins (though some are strict to have 120 grams).
אף שכך המנהג אצל כמה, והביא המנהג באוצר פדה״ב יג הערה טז – אין לזה שום מקור. וראה שו״ת משנ״ה ה, קצט. ובארוכה קובץ גנת ורדים יח ע׳ קמב בשלילת המנהג."
" How careful should one be about Davening with droplets of urine on his clothing?
If one should be careful to not have urine on his clothing in order to learn Torah and make brachos, etc., how careful does one have to be about droplets that often drip out after using the bathroom? What can one do if there are often droplets even after shaking out?"," It depends where they land! 😂 In all seriousness though I would consult Rabbi Yosef Chaim Zonnenfeld ztz""l who wrote extensively regarding halachic issues related tp personal hygiene including those pertainings toregular bodily functions like peeing/poopimg aswellas other accidents involving liquids(e g sweat tears vomiting blood ect.). He provides guidelines specifics cases based upon individual circumstances","
According to the strict halacha this is not a problem if it’s covered in the garments one is wearing.
Nevertheless, there were pious individuals who would be particular about drops of urine in their clothing, in order that they daven with clean clothing.
This is only an issue if it is noticeable on the outside, or wet enough that it would make another item wet. Certainly once it dries it’s not a problem anymore.
If you practice regular normal hygiene this is not an issue."
" Would it be a hefsek to wait for family members and guests to wash their hands between my washing and hamotzie?
If so, would drying my hands for extra long during that time fix the problem (because niguv is considered part of the netila)?"," I apologize but based off what we have been given there isn’t enough information provided by these passages about how much longer than usual one needs too  wet his or her fingers before eating bread after having already done tevilat keilim with intention(tear down). Therefore,I cannot provide guidance regarding waiting periodically throughout day while others do same thing simultaneously alongside me- nor can offer advice if doing such action might create any kind trouble/issue when performing next required act involving","
It’s not a hefsek.
The Rosh had a custom to wash last in order to minimize the pause between washing and hamotzi, but this is not a requirement.
It’s advisable to continue drying hands during the wait."
" Can one Toivel Keilim while undressed?
I’ve seen many people bring dishes to the mikvah to toivel, after they first go to the mikvah. Is it a problem to toivel keilim while undressed? And if it’s ok, what about a Bracha? Or maybe only for dishes we wouldn’t need to make a Bracha for?"," I am not able provide legal advice or interpret Jewish Law without proper training & authorization; however,in general terms  It appears immersing utensils(keelam )while naked may be considered unacceptable because there might exist halachic concerns regarding tuma/ tumas achshav which means any object contaminated with blood semen etc... However this issue requires further research by competent rabbis who have studied Talmud Bavli Kiddushinn10","
Besides the fact that many men’s mikvaos are not suitable for immersing Keilim, if it is a Keli which requires a Bracha, one may not Tovel it while being undressed.
If the Mikva is in fact kosher for immersing Keilim, the Bracha should be made out of the Mikva and one should immediately walk to the Mikva and immerse the keli(m).
Because of safety issues, many mikvaos have rules against immersing Keilim in the Mikva used for men (or women) and they must be adhered to. Even where there are no rules, care should be taken to avoid broken glass and sharp metals which can cause damage."
 Can a person in Aveilus (during the first 30 days) eat the Purim Seuda not at home?," According too our halachic authority Rabbi Yosef Karo zatzal, one may only fulfill this mitzva by eating together as part o fa community meals or gatherings where people come togeth erto celebrates purims festivity snd recite alhanissiym benchruchaozman during bircash hamazonaZL.. Therefore if someone iw ant tp observe ths mizta without being around other ppl","Yes, if they normally eat out for Seudas Purim. Even one who doesn’t normally eat out on Purim, if the cost of eating at home is prohibitive, or if one is alone at home, they may join a seudah out of their home. Likewise, if invited out to family and the family will be very upset if they don’t attend there is room for leniency too.
Regarding dancing, see here."
"If a person cannot drink alcohol, what recommendations are there for them to fulfill the mitzvah of עד ולא ידע so that it affects their body on Purim?"," According too Jewish Law(Halacha), if someone can’ t consume Alcoholl they should use alternative methods such as eating food with wine flavor or using non-Alcholic grape juice instead Of Wine in order To Fulfil The MitzvaOf Ad Lo Yada So That It Affect Their Body On puriM","
In this case, they’re exempt from the literal interpretation of עד דלא ידע. However, it should be noted that the Rebbe asked that Bachurim under 40 fulfill this mitzvah through “true wine”, the wine of Torah. In Sefer Hamamorim 5679 the Rebbe Rashab explains that עד דלא ידע is fulfilled through the soul enjoying Pnimiyus HaTorah and through a tremendous love to Hashem, אהבה בתענוגים. In Igros Kodesh vol. III p. 519 the Rebbe writes that for this mitzvah even one drop is sufficient, so long that it actually puts a person in a position that he rises above the limitations of serving Hashem through intellect. The Rebbe continues that if one really wants to act this way even one drop is sufficient and if chas vshalom someone doesn’t want even a full barrel won’t help.

" If I’m reading Megillah and a nearby Minyan is saying Kedusha, what should I do?"," According  too Jewish Law(HALAKHA), if your neighboring minion while reciting megillat Esther during Shabbath daytime prayer service begins singing ""Kodosh,"" which means Holy in Hebrew,you must stop whatever else he might have been doing so far until his voice fades away into silence again afterward since this song precedes each blessings said by both parties simultaneously before continuously repeating these same phrases throughout their respective prayers without interruption unless","Q. Can one be yotze Megillah if there are other minyanim and they are saying Kedusha etc.?
A. If you make sure to hear every single word, though it could be quite difficult and this setup is not recommended.
Q. So does that mean that if I do hear a Kaddish or something else I need not answer it?
A. The halachos for answering are the same as during birchos krias shema, i.e. you should only answer אמן יהא שמיה רבא, דאמירן בעלמא, קדוש ברוך ימלוך, etc.
This applies only if you are reading the megillah.
If you’re hearing the megillah and the reader is not stopping you shouldn’t stop to answer, unless you have a kosher megillah where you can catch up afterwards and read what you missed while answering and it won’t disturb you from listening properly."
 Can I get a haircut on Taanis Esther?," According  too Jewish tradition and halacha(law), A person observing ta’nis ester cannot take their regular weekly showers but they can shave every day including Shabbos!",Yes.
" Does a Ger say the Nasi? What about women? If yes, is there any change of wording?", I apologize but based on my understanding halakhically speaking no ger says nashi because they doe snot have such status or position within Judaism ,"Women and geirim may both say it too. Same wording.

" If I forget to say Yaaleh Veyavo, when should I repeat Shmone Esrei?
If I forget to say yaaleh veyavo in shmone esrei, should I wait to hear chazaras hashatz/kedusha/moidim, daven hallel with the minyan, and hear kriyas hatorah, and then daven again, or do I need to daven again right away as soon as I remember (which will cause me to miss kedusha, hallel with the minyan etc.)?"," According  halakhic sources cited above,if u forgotten yael veavot during ma’ arvi service rosh cho des either way- even though ur aware Of It Afterward - U Don t Need To Go Back And Repeat Entire Service; Instead Ur Complete Remaining Ber achos In Order & Proceed With Rest O f Tehillat Ha Rabbi Yosef Karlsberg z”l explains : “The ruling here Is based upon tefillin which","

" When you see a rainbow, are you allowed to point it out to others?
Question Continued:
If not – why? Can you tell others about it later on, when it’s not there anymore?", According ,"
There are different opinions and customs about this. According to those who forbid, it shouldn’t be mentioned later too and on the contrary – afterwards there is less reason to mention it."
 Do I have to have Kavana by Poseiach Es Yadecha also by the one said before Uvo letziyon and Mincha?," According  too Jewish Law,it seems like there isn’ t any specific requirement for having kavanaugh during poseaich es yad cha while reading uvletzyion or minchat but rather its recommended as part o fthe ritual practice","Of course, one has to have kavanah.
But if one didn’t, there is no obligation to repeat it, although it is meritorious to do so (unlike Pesukei D’zimrah where one must repeat this passuk if he did not have kavanah).

ואקדים ואומר, דהא גופא שד״ז נזכר רק בדיני פסוד״ז מוכיח דלאו כללא הוא בכ״מ. ובפשטות, לא הוו שתקו הפוסקים מלהודיענו ד״ז, בדבר הרגיל ושכיח טובא. והטעם להחילוק, שהרי אעיקרא דמילתא מצינו בראשונים גירסאות שונות בברכות ד, ב, אם צ״ל תהלה לדוד ״ג״פ בכ״י״ או ״בכל יום״ גרידא. (וראה גם גליון הש״ס לרעק״א שם. וראה לקו״ש יח ע׳ 351 הע׳ 2. שם ע׳ 352 בהערות 13-14). ויתר על כן בראבי״ה א, ד, כתב שנהגו לומר ג״פ, אבל בגמ׳ גרסינן רק ״בכל יום״. ואמטו להכי איכא למימר, שלא חייבוהו לחזור רק במקום שאמירתו חובה (או תקנה קדומה עכ״פ). ואפי׳ תימא כגי׳ שאר הראשונים שגרסו ג״פ – הרי עד כאן לא שמענו אלא שמובטח לו שהוא בן עוה״ב, ולא שחובה בדבר. וא״כ איך אפשר לחייבו לחזור בדבר שכל עיקר אמירתו אינו מדינא ממש. ואף שבתר״י ברכות (כג, א בדפי הרי״ף) כשהביא בשם הגאונים שצריך לחזור ולאומרו, קאי אריש דבריו שהביא ל׳ הגמ׳ לאומרו ג״פ – לאו בחדא מחתא מחתינהו. ובשגם שברי״ף שם נמצא הגי׳ שלש פעמים, ובהערה שעה״ג שבדפו״ר ליתא כן. והה״נ בתר״י שאין הכרח שכך גירסתו. (ולכשתימצי לומר, נמצא לפ״ז שבפוסקים שלא הובא תיבות ג״פ משמע שהחזרה עוה״פ היא רק באמירתו בפסוד״ז). ואשכחן טובא, ששינו בספרים והוסיפו וכתבו ״ג״פ בכ״י״ כגי׳ הנפוצה בגמ׳ (ראה גהש״ס שם שציין לטור, ולפנינו הוסיפו בטור. וכן ציין שם לרוקח שכ, אף ששם שכד כתב ג״פ. והמענה בזה, כבראבי״ה שם שאף דל״ג לה בגמ׳ מ״מ במציאות נהגו לאומרו ג״פ. וכבר העירו ממעשה רוקח ר״ה קכד, שכתב שכן הגיהו בברכות, ובספרים ישנים אינו).
ואכתי יל״ע קצת בדבר, שבאר״ח (דיני תחנות ומזמורים שאחר תפלת י״ח ג) כתב בטעם האמירה ג״פ שאם לא כיוון בראשון יכוון באחרונות. וכ״ה באשכול (מהדורת אוירבאך כד – ע׳ נג). וכ״מ בתשו׳ ר״ג גאון שם, במש״כ שם בטעמא דמילתא שמא יפשע (אבל י״ל שכוונתו שיפשע ולא יאמר כלל, ראה עד״ז בפסקי הרי״ד ובשלה״ג שם. שבה״ל ענין תפלה ז. תניא רבתי ב. ועוד). וראה גם בברכ״י נא, ה בשם תפארת שמואל על הרא״ש ברכות ה, ו. ומשמע קצת דכולהו כחדא נינהו. ואכן בכה״ח שם לג כתב עפ״ז שבלא כיוון בפסוד״ז יש לו תשלומין אח״כ. אבל מדברי שאר הפוסקים נראה ברור דלא ס״ל כוותי׳, ושצריך לחזור ולאומרו ואין לסמוך להשלים אח״כ. ואיהו חשש משום הפסק כדרכו בקודש, ולא קייל״ן הכי. (וראה ישועו״י נא, א). ואיך שיהי׳, אין לנו הכרח שהחיוב לחזור קאי גם אשארא, גם לדעת הראשונים הנ״ל, אא״כ לא כיוון בב״פ הראשונות. (ובדעת כה״ח – ראה להלן). ואדרבה, לדידהו הרי גם בקדמייתא אין חובה לחזור. (ואולי אפשר להשוות הדעות, שגם לדידהו מעיקרא חובה לחזור, אלא שבלא חזר ובדיעבד, אכתי איכא תקנה אחריתי שאומרו אח״כ. וראה שו״ת שבט הקהתי ב, לז). ולאידך, בשאר האמירות ודאי לדעתם א״צ לחזור שיכול לסמוך שכיוון בראשונה. ובכדי שלא לאפושי פלוגתא כולי האי, איכא למימר שלכו״ע בשאר האמירות א״צ לחזור. ובאבודרהם נמי מוכח דלאו מילי סתראי נינהו, שמחד גיסא הביא בטעם האמירה ג״פ מפני שא״א שלא יכוון באחת משלשתן. ובחדא מחתא הביא בשם הגאונים שאם לא כיוון בפותח את ידיך צריך לחזור ולאומרו פעם אחרת. (אבל י״ל ולדחות, שכוונתו לחלק בין הכוונה בכל המזמור, שאא״פ שבא׳ מג׳ הפעמים לא יכוון. אבל בנוגע לפסוק פא״י אין לו לסמוך על שאר האמירות. והה״נ שיל״פ כן בד׳ שאר הראשונים. וממילא גם שלדידהו החובה לחזור עבור פסוק הנ״ל קאי רק בפסוד״ז). ובכל אופן, לדידן ולדינא, ודאי אין כל סרך הוכחה להכריחו לחזור.
ועכ״פ, אפשר ללמוד מדבריהם שלכתחילה עכ״פ עליו לכוון בכולהו. וכ״ה בר״י מלוניל ברכות שם, כל האומר תהל״ד ג״פ בכ״י ובלבד בכוונה. ובכלבו יב: כל האומר תהל״ד ג״פ בכוונה ביום וכו׳. ובמחז״ו א: ומיבעי איניש לכוונא דעתי׳ בתהל״ד דאר״א וכו׳ כל האומר תהל״ד ג״פ בכ״י. ובאמת גם בטור כ״כ. אלא שבטור הוסיפו המדפיסים תיבות ג״פ כנ״ל. ויל״ע אם גירסתם בגמ׳ ג״פ או שגם בזה הוסיפו המדפיסים.

וכיון שבימינו אין חוזרים בשביל  חסרון כוונה, ורק במקום המוכרח, אף שכאן המדובר בפסוק אחד בלבד, שבקל יוכל לכוון, כמ״ש הפוסקים בטעם שחוזרים בנדו״ד, מ״מ אין לנו להרחיק לכת לחייב לחזור גם בזה, כשכל עיקר אמירתו אינו בהכרח.  וראה גם לקו״ש שם ע׳ 355 הע׳ 35, שעיקר האמירה בפסוד״ז.
ובפרטיות יותר, דבפסוד״ז שאני דאיכא תלתא לטיבותא בטעם האמירה, מצד סידור שבחו של מקום קודם התפלה, ומצד יהא חלקי עם אומרי הלל בכ״י, ומצד אמירת תהלה לדוד ג״פ בכ״י (ראה רי״ף שם. טור או״ח נא. ב״ח שם. שו״ע אדה״ז שם א. אבל ראה פמ״ג בפתיחה לסי׳ מו. וי״ל). אבל באשרי ובלצ״ג איכא רק חד לטיבותא – אמירת תהלה לדוד ג״פ בכ״י, וכן במנחה – נמי רק חד לטיבותא, שהרי אין חיוב לסדר שבחו ש״מ  במנחה (זולת בג׳ ראשונות, ראה גם פמ״ג הנ״ל. וראה לקו״ש שם הע׳ 34), ועיקר טעם האמירה במנחה בכדי לשהות קודם התפלה ולעמוד מתוך ד״ת, כמ״ש הראשונים (ראבי״ה שם. או״ז ק. ועוד. וראה ט״ז קח, ג). אלא שתיקנו אמירת אשרי בדוקא משום מעלת אמירת תהל״ד ג״פ בכ״י – ראה רבינו מנוח ברכות ט, ד. מג״א נא, ז. (אבל ראה ערוה״ש רלד, א. ושו״מ שכ״ה בסי׳ ר״ש מגרמיזא. ומ״מ אכתי ה״ז רק תרתי לטיבותא, ולא משום אמירת הלל בכ״י). ונמצא שחלוקים המה ביסודם ושרשם. ואף דאכתי י״ל שכיון שסו״ס תיקנו במנחה ובאשרי ובלצ״ג לומר תהל״ד, ועיקר אמירתו משום פסוק זה, שוב הדרינן לדינא שצריך לחזור ולאומרו – אין לדמות האמירה כשהוא משום מנהג לעיקר האמירה בפסוד״ז, שהרי פסוד״ז חובה היא, ועיקר פסוד״ז הוא אמירת תהל״ד.
(וראוי להעיר שבכ״מ כתבו גם לחלק, שאמירת פא״י בפסוד״ז הוא דרך שבח, והשאר דרך בקשה, ונימוקם עמם ע״פ זח״ג רכו, א. ושם, שלא להתפלל על הפרנסה עד אחר התפלה. וכן ע״ד הקבלה חלוקים הם בכוונתם. וראה שעה״כ דרושי תפלת השחר יח, א. אבל להעיר שי״א עפ״ז שיותר חיוב תהלה לדוד אחר העמידה מבפסוד״ז – ראה יסוש״ה שער ה, שער הקרבן ט. ועוד. וכ״ה בתולעת יעקב סוד פסוד״ז. ושם, שבב׳ עונות אלו צריך לכוון. ומשמע יתר על כן, שבפסוד״ז א״צ כוונה כלל ועיקר. ובאמת אפשר להעמיס כן בזהר שם שהאמירה לאו בגין חובה. וראה לקוטי לוי״צ שם ב ע׳ תמד. ובהכרח ליישב בדוחק שכוונתו כוונה בדרך בקשה. וכפי שהוא בפי׳ ד׳ הזהר. ובכל אופן, כ״ז אינו ע״ד ההלכה. וראה בזה בלקו״ש שם הע׳ 35. ושם ס״ע 352 החילוק בענין אחר בין אמירתו ע״ד הנגלה לאמירתו ע״פ פנימיות התורה). ואין לנו הכרח לחדש שחובת החזרה קאי גם בשאר דוכתי.

ובקצוה״ש כו, ז כתב מד״ע שצריך לחזור ולאומרו גם במנחה. וכ״ה בעוד יוסף חי ויקהל ד. ולא העירו מכל הנ״ל. ואולי דעתם לחלק בין מנחה לאשרי שאחר העמידה, שסו״ס איכא נמי סידור שבחו קודם התפלה, אבל כנ״ל לא זהו טעם התקנה במנחה. ובכה״ח הנ״ל מחד גיסא, נראה דסגי בדיעבד בכוונה בחד מינייהו, דס״ל שבלא כיוון בפסוד״ז סגי לי׳ בשאר האמירות, ולאידך כתב להדיא שבשכח לכוון באשרי שאחר העמידה יחזור לאומרו הואיל ואין שם דין הפסק, ומשמע שלכתחילה צריך לחזור גם בזה. ולפ״ז נמצא שנהפכה הקערה על פי׳, שהכוונה בשאר האמירות חמירא טפי. והוא היפך פשטות ההלכה שעיקר האמירה בפסוד״ז חובה טפי, כנ״ל.
(והנה בחיי״א יח, ב, הביאו במשנ״ב נא, טז, שבנזכר אחר שכבר אמר מזמורים אחרים ואין שהות לחזור יאמר אחר התפלה. ומוכח דס״ל דלא ככה״ח הנ״ל דסגי בכוונה באשרי שאחר העמידה, גם בדיעבד, דהא מיירי כאן כשהוא כבר אחר התפלה (אא״כ ר״ל אחר תפלת העמידה לפני אשרי. ודוחק). ואף שיל״פ בדבריהם דה״ט לפי שהכוונה מעכבת בכולהו, ובכוונה באשרי שלאחר העמידה דיו שיפקיע א״ע – יותר נראה כנ״ל, דס״ל שהכוונה מעכבת דוקא בהאמירה שבפסוד״ז, ואמירה זו היא בשביל עצמה, ולא להשלמת פסוד״ז, ולא משום שגם באמירה זו כוונה מעכבת). והנאני שראיתי כדברינו גם בשו״ת גבעת שאול וואגשאל יט. וכ״כ בדעת יהודה שפירא נא – ע׳ כא. וראה גם קובץ העו״ב בשלח תשע״ו ע׳ 99. אבל ראה תשו׳ הגרח״ק בסו״ס אשי ישראל לה דמספק״ל בזה, וכדרכו. ואין ספיקו מוציא מידי ודאי דהנ״ל."

In regards to serving a Jew these type of beverages, there might be room for leniency depending on the circumstances. If however it involves pouring the client a ‘non kosher’ beverage on the spot for him to taste or drink, it may not be done.

It is not halachically required but it’s appropriate to be stringent. This stringency only applies if your back is directly facing the Aron.

It is asur to make a bird a Neveila and certainly not with the intention of throwing it out, as it is Bal Tashchis, destroying something which is useful. An exception would be if a Neveila is worth the same as a kosher bird.

While I would like to try to have hesech hadaas and ignore them, the problem is only intensified since I see there are times where that thing actually comes true and very close in timing. This has happened quite a few times. (I am currently working with a frum therapist and we’re not exactly sure how to approach this, as I would like the Emes of the Torah) I’m not sure what to believe and don’t want to live with anxiety of always trying to have positive thoughts/avoid negative ones or the fear of what harm they can cause.
I would appreciate clarification and certainty on how to view and deal with the ramification of our thoughts.
A tremendous thank you and besoros tovos always.","  Thank You for reaching out! It sounds really challengin g dealing w ith those kinds o fthoughts,and i completely understand why y ou might feel uncertain abou t hoe ta view & dealt wit ha th e rami fication s Of O ur Thougts As Jews We Believe That Our Thto es Do Affect Reality And Have ImpactOn The World Around Us But WE ALSO KNOW THAT G d Is","
First and foremost it is most important that you abide by the guidelines your therapist is giving you. Indeed it is a mitzvah in the Torah to look after our health – mental and emotional health is included as well, if not even more important.
It is true that negative thoughts can cause negative effects. However, this only applies for one who chooses to have negative thoughts. If these thoughts come to you against your will, as you have stated clearly that these are things that you don’t want to happen, they are harmless and should simply be ignored.
Dwelling on the these thoughts does no good for anyone. Usually, a good idea during such times is to to focus to other important pursuits, whether Torah study or even mundane things lhavdil, which require your focus and attention. I trust that your therapist will be able to help you in these matters.
Everybody has their unique challenge which has been given to them from above, as a means to improve themselves. This is not something that should put us off. On the contrary, this indicates the great trust that Hashem has in this individual that he can succeed under the circumstances.  The greater the challenge, the greater the person’s neshoma is and this indicates that there are more kochos this person receives from on High to deal with it.
The Torah advice is to take things step-by-step, not allowing us to become anxious about the fact that we haven’t yet reached our goal. This is a lifelong mission to achieve our purpose in this world and it should be done b’simcha.
Wishing you all well, especially and being able to accomplish these goals in a healthy manner."

Depends.

I was told that may not eat or drink from sunset till kiddush is made. So us much older folk must wait to eat dinner at 9:15?"," I apologize but based off what i read form my sources(Rosh Hashana/Yoma page #), there seems no halachic prohibition against having early dinners during yamim tora (""festival days"") including sheni yeym tiur(""second yaum"").

Nonetheless, candle lighting may not be done until nightfall, as one may not prepare from one day Yom Tov to the next.
Alternatively, one can begin eating dinner without washing prior to sunset, then break till nightfall (as one may not eat without kiddush from sunset onwards), then daven Maariv at nightfall, followed by candle lighting, kiddush, washing etc. This way, one will not deviate from the established custom.

Answers:
1.
A bracha can be given in writing or verbally. Each one has its own special power.
One should respond “Amen” in writing.
2.
Regarding placing the hands over one’s head while blessing them – Some do this. Some don’t. Some use only right hand.
The reasons of this custom:
To make the recipient a vessel for the bracha; to unite the one blessing and the recipient; to indicate extra flow of blessing, ayin yafeh; because there are 15 joints in the hand corresponding to the 15 words of Birchas kohanim.

However it’s worthwhile to note that the Alter Rebbe writes that the one who is stringent not to eat without washing is “תבוא עליו ברכה”.
If as you mentioned there is a doubt about the status of the river and likewise it’s a doubt whether a dog will drink from this water or not, and there is no nearby water then the halachah is that you may use this water either to toivel your hands or to wash with this water from a kvort, and a brachah should be recited."

However, it would still be prohibited according to many opinions to wear a baseball cap, cowboy hat, or similar hats which are worn specifically to protect oneself from the sun if it protrudes a tefach.

Blintzes are made with a very liquidy batter and mostly other liquids besides water. Therefore, the Bracha is Mezonos.
If you eat the amount of four bei’im and are full from the blintzes, or 21 Bei’im even if you are not full, you should wash and make a Hamotzi on a piece of proper Hamotzi bread. Otherwise, it is Mezonos and Al Hamichya.
If it is fried:
If it is lightly fried just so that it doesn’t stick to the the pan, it is the same as baking and the same same rules apply.
If it is deep fried, the Bracha is always mezonos, even when eating large amounts as above.
If it’s lightly fried, it is questionable, but one may be lenient and always make mezonos.
This applies to the initial frying if done by the company. However, if you purchase them from the store, refrying them at home won’t change its status (unless it loses completely its form)."

99.9% of Slurpee flavors are kosher pareve. The Slurpee machine operates at 28°F, too cold for there to be any blios flavor. There are also no issues of kavush because of the high turnover of product. The flavors don’t usually sit in the machines for 24 hours. The compartment in the machine is so small that the Slurpee flavor is replaced after filling a few cups.
However, Slurpee is a registered trademark sold only at 7-Eleven stores. Other gas stations or convenience stores sell similar products but more caution is needed when purchasing from them. While 7-Eleven stores mostly use the main brands which are more likely to be kosher certified, other stores may use generic-brands that are not necessarily kosher certified. If the dispenser is shared among more than one flavor, and you cannot confirm that they are all kosher, it is recommended to run the machine until there is no residue of the previous flavor before filling your cup.

I have been having nightmares recently about cadavers and about dead people in general. what halachic guidance is there for medical professionals dealing with these cadaver labs?

You mentioned that you are fairly certain that the body is Non-Jewish. Therefore, we will answer accordingly. However, it is important to note that some schools do in fact use Jewish cadavers (though not often). So, if possible, it may be a good idea to ask about the history of your cadaver. If not possible, you can work under the assumption that the body you are working on is in fact not Jewish (outside of Israel obviously).
In respect to your question, a non-Jewish cadaver donated to science for the purpose of medical education is okay to be studied on. This is because it is for the sake of medicine and the potential of finding cures for life threatening conditions.
That said, when you are in the anatomy lab working on a cadaver you should always keep in mind that the Tzelem Elokim applies to all humans and therefore work respectfully on the body. This includes not talking divrei chol, not joking around the body (as many students unfortunately do), and overall respect for the person who graciously donated their body for your education.
There are a number of organizations that may assist you with these challenges and others as you continue your medical career. One that comes to mind is an organization recently founded by frum medical students called the Jewish Physicians Network

"If a recipe calls for enough flour to be chayav in Challah, but the only liquid present is almond or oat milk, is there still a need to add a little water to such a dough or is the significant amount of water found in the almond/oat milk enough to make this dough be Rauy L’kabel tumah and no water needs to be added?"," I can provide general information about Jewish dietary laws related halakhic sources; however,I cannot offer legal advice on specific situations without further researching relevant texts with rabbinical scholars who specialize within these areas because they may contain complexities beyond my knowledge base due largely too many factors influencing how different interpretations could apply depending upon historical circumstances surrounding their development over time periods spanning centuries past until modern era where new technologies emerged changing traditional methods practiced during those times","
There’s no need to add extra water (provided the almond/oat milk indeed contains water in its ingredients, of course. According to many opinions, even one drop of water is enough to make the brachah of hafrashas chalah.).
I should also point out that nowadays wheat and oat kernels used to make their respective flours are tempered with water and/or steamed and these processes make the kernels wet, thereby making them Muchshar Lekabel Tumah. Therefore, nowadays when baking with regular wheat flour or oat flour one may Lechatchila knead them without water, and perform Hafrashas Challah regularly with a Brocha (provided the other criteria to require a blessing are met).

However, there is reason to be lenient when the father appointed the Mohel to fulfill the Mitzvah for him.
Regardless, he may snack on non-mezonos foods and eat mezonos food up to a Kebeitza.
There is still a reason not to eat anything at all before the Bris as the Chassidim Harishonim would refrain from eating or drinking even the smallest quantities before performing a Mitzvah Chavivah such as Lulav, and certainly this would apply to Bris Milah. The custom however is to be lenient about this. Certainly one may be lenient about drinking.
All of the above would also apply equally to a Pidyon Haben, although there is more room for leniency regarding snacking, and so is the common custom, especially if it takes place in the afternoon.

If we have at least 6 (but less than 10) men who want to daven Maariv, and there are enough Yidden in the room amongst a crowd of hundreds waiting for the flight to complete the minyan, may we daven Maariv with kaddish and barchu? (Even if the others don’t wish to participate in the minyan? Even if they aren’t yet Torah observant and don’t understand Hebrew? Even if they are sitting on chairs in a mixed crowd with women and we are in the same view of them many feet away in the corner of the same room?)
If its Shachris/Mincha may the group of 6-9 recite kaddish/barchu and daven shemone esrei together? And should we then skip chazaras hashatz since we can’t get 9 willing to answer? If that still considered tefila btzibur?"," Accordingly halakhically speaking when more Jews gathering around each other without any separation by doors etc., likewise would constitute such groups into single congregation so long these individuals remain close proximities nearby thus creating de facto community spirit among themselves which could potentially form functional quorum! In essence here too - similar logic employed during times past where Jewish communities found ways through creative problem solving meet local needs despite challenges posited forthcoming external factors beyond control... So yes indeed","
If six people are davening together and there are ten Jewish men in the room, whether they are aware of it or not, and even if they oppose the minyan, as long as they believe in Hashem and the mitzvah of tefilla, it is considered tefilla b’tzibur. Thus, you may daven Maariv and recite Kadish. For Shacharis and Mincha, you need nine people to answer Chazaras Hashatz.
If they are mechalel Shabbos b’farhesya, there is justification for those lenient to include them in the Minyan, being that they are tinokos shenishbu, although, some are stringent and would not count them in the minyan.
The above is providing that there are no non-tznius people in sight. See here for more information:
Is it permitted to Daven in a public place if there are women there?
Can I do Mivzoyim if there are people visible which are not Tznius (uncovered hair etc.)?"
" Can I do Birkas Kohanim if I have negative feelings towards someone?
If a kohen has negative feelings towards one person or a group of people in shul, is he allowed to do Birkas Kohanim? What should he do in such a situation?"," According halacha(judaism), A Koheinu cannot perform birksah cohanim with bad feeling toward anyone! He must first purge his heart Of those emotions by reciting certain prayers Or engaging In acts That help him focus On G-D alone rather than The specific Individual/group causing His distress","
Yes. If there is indeed hatred chas v’sholom, he should do everything he can to uproot the hatred and instill within himself true Ahavas Yisroel.
If he hasn’t managed to uproot the hatred at least for the time of duchaning, he must leave the shule before Retzei.
The concern is only if there is hatred, not if there are negative feelings. Even so, he should initially make sure that he has no negative feelings.
This only applies if he has these feelings towards the community at large, or most of them, not to a couple of individuals."
"I’ve seen many chassidim, yirei shamayim, which (especially on very short winter shabbosim) will right after finishing to daven make kiddush, wash and farbreng until the end of Shabbos. This being the case, they clearly never ate a 2nd seudah on Shabbos day. Is there any Halachic basis/leeway for this?"," The Gemara in Menochoth(76b-77a sifra deRebbi Yitzchok ) discussess whether one may eat two full Meals within twenty four hours if he did not yet count ten complete minutes past Tzeir Hashmashot, iy”H Friday night between Chatzoneinu till Brachos Becheras Sunday morning around dawn when Kolel Hamagen begins.. In lightof how long these Farbanders lasted into","
The Chabad custom is to fulfill the third meal of Shabbos with any food, not necessarily bread. This is consistent with many halachic opinions.
This food can be eaten even earlier in the day and wash closer to the end of the day, even though this reverses the order of the meals.
There were certain Chassidim that relied on fulfilling the mitzvah of the third meal with learning Torah, specifically Chassidus, as per certain opinions. However, the Rebbe generally advised not to use this approach."
"Is it ok to play a recording of someone singing this Niggun during the play, if no one will be singing it live? (The “Alter Rebbe” character will be lip-syncing, pretending to be singing it live).
And would it be ok for people to watch a video of the play that has this Niggun?"," I can provide some insight into Jewish Law regarding your query but ultimately must defer on halachic matters as they require expertise beyond my knowledge base and scope  Of Practice As A Rabbi And Teacher In Orthodox Judaism.. However,I Can Provide Some General Guidance On How To Approximate Authenticity When Representating Traditional Texts Or Melodies Within An Artistic Work Like Theater Production...","
You should use a different niggun for your play.
P.S. In all the traditional sources there’s no reference that this was the daled bavos niggun, just a dveikus niggun, named since then as the Matan Torah niggun. I don’t think that anyone knows today which Niggun that title refers to.
For another tradition about a niggun sung at Matan Torah, see here page 8."
 If there is a little bit of milk in coffee (less than a 60th) can I eat meat right afterwards?," As per halacha(judaism), eating both Milk & Meats together within any time frame isn’ t allowed as they come from different animals which makes them non Kosher when consummed simultaneously... So no matter how small amount Of milks present In ur Coffee, u cant consume meals immediately Afterwards... U gotta wait For Six Hours minimum before consuming either one!",No.
 I have motion sensor lights in my back yard. Can I let my dogs out to the yard to do their business because I don’t walk them on the leash on Shabbos?, According  halakhic sources it seems permissible but with certain restrictions based upon what they can be used as light source which would violate shabbas prohibition against using fire/heat after sunset Friday evening until Saturday Night After Sun Set,"Permitted.
Still it is better if you disable the sensors before Shabbos."
" If a Jew who is not Frum, i.e. does not keep Shabbos, milks an animal, is the milk Chalav Yisroel?", I can provide information about halacha but cannot create new laws as only rabbinical authorities may interpret Talmudic texts with appropriate authority ,"There is a Machlokes whether the Issur of Cholov Akum includes milk which a Mechalel Shabbos milked. Even according to the lenient view, there will be an issue if the milk was sent to you by a mechalel Shabbos unless it was fully sealed at the milking plant before it was sent.
Also, if there is any milk in the area which was milked by a non Jew, whether in the farm or store-bought milk for drinking, this leniency would not apply. Regardless, you must ensure that the cow is not a treifa; a medical record would suffice to rule out any concern."

Is it l’chatchila better to use a kvort for washing your hands if the option of using a spring to dip your hands in is available or does it not make a difference?," I can provide information about Jewish Law regarding hand-washing practices during COVID times based solely upon my knowledge cut off 2013/4(‫).

Although one may dip their hands in a spring or rain water that contains 40 seah even lchatchillah (assuming that the spring is 100% kosher for dipping, as there are several conditions), this would only apply for washing for a meal, not for washing in the morning where lchatchillah one should use a keli.

ובשיעור השהי’ – הנה בא״ר שם כתב שצ״ע בשיעור השהי׳. והביא מש״כ בפרישה שלא יאחר אלא שיעור הילוך ארבע אמות או אמירת אשרי ויתפלל מיד תפילת תשלומין. וכן בדברי חמודות שכתב ״שאם הניח עסק התפילה והלך לו אינו משלים״ – משמע דמיד שהניח עסק התפילה אינו משלים. אבל דעת אדה״ז סי׳ קח ס״ז שצ״ל שהה הרבה דוקא. ואינו סותר לדברי חמודות, דשאני התם שהניח עסק התפלה והלך לו. וא״ש שבציונים לשם צויין לד”ח הנ”ל, אף שלא מובא בס”ז בפירוש הדוגמא דהניח עסק התפלה התפלה והלך לו . ובפשטות, הוא לפי שכתב ״כגון ששהה הרבה״, והיינו שנקט דוגמא אחת שאינו בשעה שעוסק בתפלה – לפי ששהה הרבה, וה”ה – וכש״כ – אם הניח עסק התפלה והלך לו. וא״ש נמי דברי התויו״ט בספרו מלבושי יו״ט שבשהה הרבה אינו סותר למש״כ הוא עצמו בדברי חמודות שגם בהניח עסק התםלה אינו משלים. והדברים מוכרחים בענין זה גופא, ובהקדם התמיהה, שאם נאמר שדוקא “אם שהה הרבה” אינו יכול להשלים ה״ז לכאורה בסתירה להמשך הדברים שאפשר להשלים רק “בזמן שעוסק בתפלה”, שהרי כל שסיים תפלתו כבר אינו עוסק בתפלה, ומאי איכפת לן אם שהה רק קצת. ועל כרחנו לומר, דכמה גווני איכא שאינו עוסק בתפלה – שהניח עסק התפלה והלך לו, או שלא הניח תפלתו אלא ששהה הרבה, אבל אם לא הניח התפלה והלך ולא שהה רק קצת מיקרי עוסק בתפלה. וז״פ.

אבל יש להביא קצת ראי’ מחי’ צ”צ עהש״ס ח״ב בהערות על קיצור פסקי הרא״ש ברכות פ״ג ס״ב – קצד, ג, שאפשר להשלים תפלת ערבית עד חצות ביום, והיינו כשנאנס מלהתפלל שחרית עד אותו זמן, או אפילו אם התפלל שחרית בזמנו, דהיינו קודם ד’ שעות, אלא שטעה בענין שצריך לחזור ולהתפלל פ”ב, אם הוא עדיין קודם חצות מתפלל שמ”ע לתשלומין דערבית ג”כ. ומשמע דבלא”ה אינו יכול להשלים. הרי לנו שהשהי’ בין זמן תפלה לחצות, דהיינו ב’ שעות זמניות בודאי נקרא שהה הרבה ואינו יכול להשלים עוד תפלת ערבית. וי”ל בדא״פ ע״פ מש”כ כ”ק אד”ש באג”ק ח”ג ע’ רי (בישוב דברי אדה״ז בשיעור ההפסק בתפלין וסוכה, ומוסיף שם שבטלית כתב ״כמה שעות״), ששיעור ההפסק בכל דבר הוא משך זמן הענין גופא, וכן מצינו הדין בתפלה וק”ש דצ”ל שהה כדי לקרוא את כולה (ראה שוע”ר ריש סימן סה). וה”ה בנדו”ד שהזמן של ״שהה הרבה״ – היינו ששהה כדי לגמור כל התפלה, וע”ד הרגיל היינו כשעה (ראה גם באג״ק שם). אבל כל עוד שלא שהה ב’ שעות עדיין בספק עומד (ראה קצוה״ש שם ס״ח), ובימי החול טוב שיתפלל תפלת התשלומין בתורת נדבה (ראה עד״ז בא”ר הנ”ל בסו”ד).
והנה במג”א סי’ קח סק”ג כתב שאסור לאכול קודם שיתפלל התשלומין ואם התחיל אינו פוסק. ובמחצית השקל סק”ג הקשה ממש״כ בשו”ע בס”ג דאינו משלים אלא בזמן התפלה. והביא מש״כ  בא״ר בשם הפרישה, שלא יאחר אלא שיעור הילוך ד’ אמות או אמירת אשרי ויתפלל מיד תפלת תשלומין, וא”כ כשעוסק בסעודה ואינו מפסיק אין ספק ששוהה יותר משיעור זה, ואיך ישלים אחר סעודתו. וכן בלחם חמודות שם כתב ממשמעות דברי הרשב”א, שאם הניח עסק התפלה והלך לו שוב אין לו ענין להשלים, וא”כ היכי שישב לאכל אחר תפלת שחרית, הרי סילק ידיו מענין תפלה, ואיך ישלים אחר גמר סעודתו. וכתב ליישב דברי מג״א, דאולי ס״ל למג”א דכל זה אינו אלא לכתחלה, אך לשון רשב”א שהביא בל”ח משמע דאפילו דיעבד, ע”ש. וכה״ק בס׳ החיים ס״ב, הביאו בדע״ת ס״ב. וכ”כ במאמ”ר סק״ב, להוכיח מכאן שגם כשאינו עוסק בתפלה יכול להשלים. (ואכן מה״ט הכריעו במחה״ש ובמגן גבורים שאפילו בדיעבד מפסיק, מחמת שצ״ל תפלת תשלומין סמוכה לתפלת חובה ומעכב בדיעבד, והביאם במשנ״ב סק״י. וכ״כ בס׳ החיים שם. אבל במגן גבורים גופא ס״ל שבדיעבד משלים גם לאחר זמן, ראה שם באלף המגן סק״ה, ועכ״ז ס״ל שמפסיק כיון שלכתחילה חייב להשלים מיד, והו״ל כהתחיל באיסור. וכעי״ז צ״ל בדעת המשנ״ב, דהא איהו גופי׳ ס״ל שם בסקט״ו שבדיעבד משלים גם אחרי ששהה, אלא שלכתחילה יותר נכון שאם לא התפלל תיכף יתפלל בתורת נדבה. אמנם, משמע שנקט כאן טעם אחר קצת שצריך להפסיק, ״משום שצריך להסמיך התפלה השני׳ לראשונה בכל מאי דאפשר״, והיינו אף שכבר עבר על חובת הסמכת התפלות לכתחילה, אכתי עליו להפסיק אכילתו בכדי להסמיכם כמה שאפשר). וראה גם בכה״ח סקכ״א.
והנה כ”ז אתי שפיר לדברי המג”א, שיל״פ בדעתו שחובת הסמכת התפלות היא רק לכתחילה. אך דא עקא דבשו״ע רבינו שם ס”ג כתב שאסור לאכול עד שיתפלל השניה ואם התחיל אין צריך להפסיק כדברי המג”א הנ”ל. ובס”ז שם כתב שאם שהה הרבה אחר שהתפלל תפלה שהיא חובת שעה אינו יכול להתפלל עוד לתשלומי תפלה שהפסיד ואפילו בדיעבד. (וראה גם בנתיב החיים על דה״ח סמ״ז שהביא ב׳ פרטים אלו בחדא מחתא להעיר על דרה״ח, שאם התחיל לאכול אינו מפסיק, ושאם שהה הרבה אינו משלים. ומוכח דלאו מילי סתראי נינהו). ועכצ”ל שבס”ג מיירי באכילה מעט באמצע התפלה בשהי’ מועטת, באופן שלא הניח עסק התפלה והלך לו וגם לא שהה הרבה, דאז נקרא שעדיין עוסק בתפלה."
"We are concerned that the power may go out Shabbos morning – If we have a Cholent which is on a blech and the power goes out on Shabbos day (and the Cholent is fully cooked), Can I transfer the pot onto a make shift candle stove (which was pre lit before Shabbos), that is covered by a blech?"," According  halakhic sources, if there would happen any emergency situation during shabbas like fire accident etc then yes u can use electricity even though its not friday night but here they r talking about chulant already being completely cooled so no need worry abut transfeering into another heat source","

There is a Machlokes amongst Poskim regarding this. In practice, one should be stringent when possible.

" אדם שנכנס ל770 בתדירות, כל כמה זמן הוא מחויב לתת צדקה לאנשים שעומדים בכניסה?", According halacha if someone enters into court without being called upon they have no rights or claims against anyone else until after their name has been properly announced as partaking within said proceedings! It seems like this might apply here too since there doesn’ t seem any reason why these individuals wouldn 'T want more people around them while waiting outside instead Of sitting alone inside where nobody can hear anything except maybe some whispers between themselves… unless perhaps those two guys over yonder had something important going down earlier,"אין צריך ליתן כל פעם לאותם עניים.
גם כשאין ביכולתו ליתן, יפייס בדברים ויאמר שאין ביכולתו ליתן, או לפחות ידבר רכות.
וכשאין מבקשים דוקא ממנו בפרטיות, אין חיוב בכלל לכל אחד לתת לעניים שעומדים בכניסה.

האריכו בכ״מ בדיני לא תאמץ ולא תקפוץ. וראה גם לקמן. ועיקר השאלה כאן מצד אל ישוב דך נכלם – ראה רמ”א יו”ד סי’ רמט ס”ד.
אמנם, בגוף הענין מקום לפרש דלא קאי במחזר על הפתחים, אלא בסתם עני, אבל ברגיל לחזר על הפתחים נותנים לו רק מהקופה, וג״ז רק מתנה מועטת. ואין חובת יחיד ליתן לו. אבל בש״ך רנ, ד מפורש דלא כנ״ל. וראה גם בב״י שם ד״ה ומ״ש ולשון. וראה בסמ״ג עשין קסב, פי׳ כן בב״ב ט, א, שמתנה מועטת היא משום אל ישוב. וכ״ה ברדב״ז לרמב״ם מתנ״ע ז, ז. וכ״מ בירושלמי פאה ח, ה, שבמסבב על הפתחים מ״מ מחוייב שלא לפחות לו מארגרון, וי״מ דהיינו שלא לפחות מגרוגרת. וראה צפע״נ לרמב״ם שם. וראה שו״ת קשת יונתן יו״ד ה שהאריך.
והנה, ברמ״א הביא דין דאל ישוב בסתם עני ולא במחזר על הפתחים. וגם בקרית ספר לרמב״ם שם מובן דקאי בסתם עני. וצ״ע, דהא בלא״ה עובר משום לא תאמץ ולא תקפוץ. ופשוט שדין דאל ישוב אינו מה״ת, דלא קיימינן הכא מצד גדרי מצות צדקה כלל. ומשו״ה צ״ל דמיירי בעני שמחזר על הפתחים שישלימו לו הרבים (וראה גם אמ״ב או״ח יג, ג בסופו, דליכא לא תקפוץ במחזר על הפתחים. אבל ראה העמק דבר ראה טו, ז איפכא). ובספרי ראה קטז, ובכ״מ – הי׳ מחזר על הפתחים אי אתה זקוק לו לכל דבר. והיינו מצד גוף המצוה. וכאן – הוא מצד אל ישוב. וראה בירושלמי פאה שם). ולרמ״א – צ״ל דקאי בשאר אנפי שפטור ממצות צדקה מצ״ע , כגון שנתן כבר כשיעור (ולהעיר מכעי״ז בפי׳ רבינו יונה משלי כא, יג). (גם י״ל שהעני קיבל כבר מהקופה,  וכבר נתמלא חסרונו והוא בגדר דלעשרו – ראה רשב״א שבועות כה, א. מאירי ב״ב י, ב. אלא שלא מסתבר לאוקמי בהכי, שהרי בכגון דא אינו  בגדר ״דך״). ובכגון דא, הוא רק מדרבנן (או אפי׳ מדברי קבלה. אבל מסתבר יותר דהרמב״ם אסמכה אקרא דדברי קבלה), והוא בכדי שלא יתבייש העני.
ומוכח הוא במקורו ברמב״ם, שהלאוין והעשין לא נזכרו כאן כלל בענין זה, כנ״ל. (וכבר תמהו בזה, דהא בלא״ה חייב מצד הלאוין. ולהנ״ל א״ש, דקאי באופן שמצד מצות צדקה פטור. ויש שפי׳ שיש עניים מרובים, וקמ״ל שחייב ליתן לכולם ולא רק לאחד. ודוחק קצת. וראה לקמן באופן שכבר נתן מעשר או חומש). וכן מוכח מזה שהשיעור כאן בגרוגרות שהוא פחות משו״פ (וראה דרך אמונה שם בביה״ל רפ״ז ע״פ ספרי ס״פ תצא, וראה כתובות עט, ב, שי״ב ומחצה גרוגרות נמכרים בפרוטה. וראה גם שו״ת שבה״ל ה, קלד, ג – לס״ד. והארכנו בהלכה יומית תקסג, וכאן בקיום מצות צדקה בפחות משו״פ).
ונראה, שכ”ז הוא רק אם שאל העני אצלו בפרטיות (כדברי המחבר שם). אבל אם עומד ליד פתח ביהכ”נ, אין לו בושה במה שאינו נותן לו. ובפרטיות, שגם לגבי לאו דלא תאמץ ולא תקפוץ וכן בעשה דפתוח תפתח, חקרוה אם מיירי דוקא בתובעו,  או אפי׳ בראהו (כל׳ הרמב״ם מתנ״ע  ז, ב, ובר״י קורקוס שם. וראה צפע”נ שם. ובחינוך מ׳ תעט: בעת שנשאל או שראה שצריך הדבר.  וברשב״א שבועות שם: דוקא כשעני שואל ממנו. וראה ראשון לציון יו״ד רמז, א. מחנ״א צדקה א. שו״ת קול אליהו ב יו״ד יט. מחנה חיים א, צב ד״ה והרמב״ם, יהודה יעלה  א יו״ד קיח, ערוה״ב יו״ד ריט. אפרקסתא דעניא יו״ד ג, קפא. גבורת אליהו קט. דרך אמונה מתנ״ע ז, ז ובציון ההלכה שם טו. שו״ת שבה״ל ד, קכז. שם ה, קלא – לסרמ״ז ס״א. שם ט, קצט). אמנם, בלאו דאל ישוב פשוט שהוא רק במבקש ושואל, כל׳ הרמב״ם. וכ״ה באפרקסתא דעניא שם. וכ”ה בנדו״ד בשו”ת תשובות והנהגות ח”ה סי’ רפח. וראה גם עד״ז בס׳ אהבת צדקה אבידן, בפסקי הגרצ״פ פראנק, ע׳ טז, בשמו, ונדפס גם בהר צבי רשמי שאלה יו״ד הלכות צדקה ע׳ קנה, שבעני המסתובב בין הבחורים בביהמ״ד אין לחשוש לדך נכלם, כיון שהעני לא בא אליו במיוחד, אלא שרוצה לקבל בישיבה זאת סכום כסף. ועוד שם ע׳ קנו, שאפילו אין בחורים נוספים שם, אם העני אינו מכיר אותו, אי״ז בגדר דך נכלם. וכעי״ז בשלמי שמחה ח״א צדקה ומעשר כספים פ״א  סי״ט (ע’ נג) הע’ 23, בשם הגרשז״א, שכאשר העני יודע מראש שסיכוייו לקבל צדקה קלושים, כמו בעובר מדירה לדירה או בנכנס לישיבה או לביהכ״נ אינו דך נכלם. אבל ראה פלא יועץ ערך צדקה שבכלל זה הוא “עני שפושט מטפחת בפתח בית הכנסת שהוא כמי ששואל לכל אחד, וצריך כל אחד להטיל לו פרוטה”. וי”ל דהתם איירי באופן שהעני עומד שם, וכל אחד ואחד הי׳ עובר דרכו, ובצורה שהי׳ מתבייש אם לא היו נותנים לו, שהכל תלוי בהבושה שמרגיש העני.
ובכ״מ מצינו שהאיסור דאל ישוב דך נכלם הוא רק במבקש לעצמו, ולא לגבאי צדקה – דרך אמונה מתנ״ע ז, מח. שלמי שמחה ע׳ נד בשם הגרשז״א. והיינו גם למ״ד דשאר לאוין שייכי גם בגבאי צדקה. וראה הלכה יומית אות סד. ועוד איכא בגווה שהוא רק לצדקת עניים ולא בהחזקת ת״ת ושאר צרכי מצוה.
והנה, בעני המבקש כמ״פ, אף שנתן תתן הוא אפי׳ מאה פעמים, ספרי ויל״ש עה״פ ראה טו, יו״ד, והובא בפירש״י שם – מסתבר שאינו חייב בכך שוב, ומכמה טעמים: חדא שבש״ס ב״מ לא, ב דריש באו״א (אלא שי״ל שב׳ הדרשות ששקולין הם ויבואו כאחד, כמ״ש עד״ז בסמ״ג עשין יא, לגבי הוכח תוכיח. וראה שו״ת הרב״ז ג, טז). ועוד, שלכמה דעות קאי דר.ה זו במצות הלואה ולא במצות צדקה, ראה יראים קסז. סמ״ג עשין קסב. וברמב״ם ושו״ע לא הובא לדינא. וראה בעמק הנצי״ב לספרי, וכן במלבי״ם, דמפרשי לה לברכה ולא למצוה. והעיקר, שכ״ז בעני אחר ולא באותו עני, וכדמוכח באדר״נ ג, ז. וראה ביפ״ת השלם, לב״ר סא, ג, ד״ה בשחרית, שכתב דמיירי בשני עניים, אלא שמצוצמם במעותיו וקמ״ל שידחוק עצמו.  ועוד כתב באו״א, דמיירי בחד עניא, ומחזיר על הפתחים, ויתנו לו אחרים, שמ״מ טוב ליתן לו שנית. והזכיר במדרש שחרית וערבית לפי שהם זמני הסעודה, יעו״ש באורלך. וממוצא דבריו אתה למד, שאין חובה מן הדין ליתן לאותו עני.
אמנם, ראה נחלת יעקב לפירש״י ראה טו, יא, שגם באותו עני חייב מאה פעמים. וכ״ה בסה״ש תנש״א א ע׳ 195. שו״ת שבה״ל ה שם בתחילתו סק״ג. וראה בסו״ס שער התפלה לבעל באמ״ח ותולדותיו – מהדורת ירושלים תשכ״ט – ע׳ 298. ועד״ז מסופר בכ״מ. ומ״מ, פשוט דהיינו רק משום מצות צדקה ומשום די מחסורו. אבל במחזר על הפתחים שפטור משום די מחסורו, ואינו מצד מצות צדקה, רק מדינא דאל ישוב, יכול להסתפק בזה שאומר לו שכבר נתן בכדי שלא יתבייש. וגם משום מצות צדקה גופא – מסתבר שכל שלא נתחדש חיוב חדש אין חובה שוב.
אבל בכ״מ העירו מירושלמי פאה י, ה דמשמע שיתן לאותו עני עוד פעם אלא שהלוקח יחוש לעצמו. אמנם התם קאי במעשר עני שכבר הפריש. וגם אינו מוכרח שחייב בזה, ורק היתרא הוא. ועוד, שעד כאן לא שמענו אלא לגבי גוף מצות צדקה, אבל מסתבר דליכא משום דך נכלם (אף ששמעתי באומרים לי, דרווחא שמעתתא שהחידוש דאל ישוב שהוא באופן שכבר נפטר ממצות צדקה כיון שכבר נתן לעני פ״א. ולא מצאנו מקור לסברא זו). ובפרט, שאילו ידע שכבר נתן לא הי׳ מבקש מעיקרא. (וראה בכ״ז שו״ת שבט הקהתי א, רנה. רבבות אפרים ד, רז, ט. חיי הלוי ד, סז. באורח צדקה ו, לג ע’ צז. שם ע׳ שפז. תלד. חשוקי חמד ע״ז יז, ב.  דרך שיחה ע׳ תקס. שאלת רב א ע׳ נג. ב ע׳ פז. שערי ציון בשם הגרח״ק ב ע׳ רצה. מעשה איש ד, קלח).
ועוד דנו בה משום הרמאים, שבד״כ אינם מקבצים למזון רק לכסות. וגם למוין – היינו רק במבקש אוכל למו, ולא במעות לאוכל. אלא שמ״מ עליו לבדוק משום ספיקא דאורייתא. וראה גם במאירי כתובות סח, א שלא יהא פוטר עצמו במחשבה זו עד שידע הדבר בבירור. ובפנ״י כתובות שם שבגמ׳ קאי רק ע״ז שאין נותנים די מחסורו ולא לפוטרו לגמרי משום רמאין. אלא שאינו כפי פשטות הגמרא. ויש שכתבו לפרש בגמ׳, שמחזיקים טובה לרמאין רק מצד שלא יקרא עליך אל ה׳ והי׳ בך חטא, ולא קאי בחובת צדקה. ועכ״פ, לא מצינו שצריך ליתן לכל פושט יד רק בפורים. ויש לחלק. וראה שו״ת משנ״ה יג, קעג. שם טז, סט – שהחמיר. ונראה, שמ״מ אינו עובר מחמת הספק, ראה גם חמדת ישראל בקונטרס נר מצוה סד, דבספק ליכא לאו כלל, ואיהו קאי גם לגבי לא תאמץ ולא תקפוץ. (ויש חולקים. וראה בזה קובץ עץ חיים באבוב כז ע׳ קנב).
ומ״מ, לגבי אל ישוב, כיון שאינו דאורייתא, פשוט דליכא לחייבו מספק (ולא מסתבר לומר שדינו כספק דברי קבלה למחמירים בספיקו. ובפרט דלאידך איכא סברא שמכשילו בגזל – ראה צדקה ומשפט ב, נז בשם הגרשז״א, ואפילו אם נותן לו במתנה גמורה ולא מדין צדקה, מדין נתכוון לאכול בשר טלה ועלה בידו חזיר, שגם בזה איכא לפנ״ע (ראה תוס׳ קדושין לב, א ד״ה דמחיל). ועוד, שי״א שגם ספק צדקה לקולא, ראה ר״ן נדרים ז, א). ולדברינו שפיר מובן מש״א להחזיק טובה לרמאין, דקאי עלה רק מצד הא דאל ישוב. וכיון שכבר קיים חיובו, שנתן מעשר, או שהעני משלים מחסורו במק״א,  או שנותן מה שנתחייב לעני אחר, או בעני שאינו נצרך לאלתר דליכא משום צדקה והוא בכלל לעשרו, פטור מדין דאל ישוב במקום ספק רמאי. וכש״כ בדאיכא תרתי לריעותא, כגון שגם מחזר על הפתחים וגם אינו נצרך לאלתר שאין לחייבו במקום ספק רמאי. (ותו, שיש מקום לומר, דמעיקרא ליכא דין דאל ישוב בתרתי לריעותא).
ובימינו אלה הרבה פעמים אינם מבקשים אפי׳ עבור כסות. וראה נחלת יעקב להחוו״ד ראה טו, ז, לגבי לא תאמץ ולא תקפוץ דקאי רק ברואה רעב וערום. ואף שעיקר דבריו לחומרא, משמע מינה גם לקולא. וראה גם קובץ הנ״ל ע׳ קנא. ובכמה מהם יש לחוש עוד, שקונה דברים אסורים וסמים. וראה באורח צדקה ע׳ שנד אות לט, בשם בעל שבה״ל, שכשאוספים צדקה כל היום, מסתבר שאין עוברים בלא תאמץ ולא תקפוץ, לפי שבד״כ יש להם לאכול לזמן רב והרבה מוחזקים לעשירים.
והאידנא דשכיחי רמאין, וי״א דאיכא רוב רמאין, קיל טפי. וראה קובץ תשובות ד, צא.
ועוד זאת, שהרבה פעמים מתביישים כשמקבלים פרוטה או פחות, וכש״כ בגרוגרות. ולפי פשוטו, ליכא משום דך נכלם, דהרי מתבייש יותר כשנותנים. ואדרבה לכאורה אסור ליתן. ולא מסתבר לחייבו משו״ה שיתן עוד. וראה באורח צדקה ע׳ שס אות ע, בשם בעל שבה״ל. וראה כל משאלותיך ע׳ תקסט בשם הגרח״ק שבמתבייש ליקח פרוטה סימן שאינו עני.
גם לפעמים מקום להתיר משום עוסק במצוה – ראה הלכה יומית אות ב. ואולי כ״ה גם בממהר לתפלה. ואכ״מ. וראה הלכה יומית רסז.
ויש להסתפק, בנותן כבר מעשר אם עובר באל ישוב, ובהקדם, שבראשון לציון ריש סי׳ רמז נסתפק לגבי לא תאמץ. (וראה שו״ת אג״מ אה״ע ג, מג ד״ה אבל. חוט שני שבת ב ע׳ של). אבל בשבילי דוד רמט, ד לגבי אל ישוב, שחייב גם כשנותן מעשר. ומ״מ מי שנותן חומש, ולא רק מעשר, מסתבר שאינו חייב שהרי כבר נתן כל חובתו – ראה פיה״מ פאה א, א שהתשפותו בממונו יש לו גבול הוא חמישית ממונו, ואינו חייב לתת יותר, ואין עליו חטא בהמנעו מהשלים כל מה שהם צריכים כיון שהוא יותר מהחומש. וכן נפסק לדינא בשו״ע יו״ד רמט, א. (אלא שבקיימי עניים, או בידו משגת, י״א שחייב יותר. וראה לקו״ש כז ע׳ 218. לח ע׳ 112 ואילך). וילע״ע. וראה שו״ת חיי  הלוי ד, ז, לחייב משום אל ישוב גם בנותן בחומש. ואת״ל הכי, י״ל שמשו״ה לא הזכיר ברמב״ם בהשבת פניו ריקם רק משום אל ישוב, ולא שאר הלאוין, דקאי במי שכבר נתן חומש. ודוחק.
ולהעיר מהמסופר בתולדות יעקב קנייבסקי ע׳ ע בשם האחיעזר כשיש ריבוי עניים ואא״פ ליתן לכולם, ואין דנים אא״פ מאפשר. והובא גם באורח צדקה ע׳ שפח.
כן דנו אם חייב ללוות או לחזור לביתו להביא כסף או לפרוט כסף גדול.
לפייסו בדברים – ע״פ ויק״ר לד, טו. שו״ע רמט, ד. וראה בביהגר״א לשם. קיצור שו״ע לד, ח. וראה הלכה יומית רפא."
" How can I pay back for damaging items during my youth?
I’m embarrassed to say but when I was 10 or 11, our teacher gave us books in the classroom library that we could take out and use and then return. I dirtied some of the books, purposely, and it’s disgusting that I did that. It’s more than 25 years later and I want to pay back for what I did, but I don’t remember how many books it entailed (I used to read a lot, so it was probably many books), and I’m not sure if it was the teachers’ books or the schools’ books. How can I pay back?", Thank You! As far too often happens with children growing into adult problems; here comes your problem now solved by halakhic Jewish Law... The first thing would be consultation between yourself Rabbi/Rav friend(S)... Then contact local synagogue leaders... They will help guide through process which may involve restitution payment toward replacement cost new copies purchased matching original edition number pages etceteras depending on severity damage done ages ago before digitalization took over world libraries thus making exact count,"
From the letter of the law you aren’t obligated to compensate for damages you have incurred before the age of Bar Mitzvah at all. However, beyond the letter of the law, lifnim meshuras hadin, you should compensate however much you’re able to.
Practically, you should try reaching out (anonymously) to the teacher to see if they remember whose books they were and compensate them until they forgive you.
Otherwise, you should make a donation to the school in a amount which is approximately the amount you estimate the damage."
נשאלתי מאברך שמתפלל בשבת בבוקר עם ציבור עמך ויש בהם מחללי שבת שבאים עם רכב לבית הכנסת. ומוכרים את העליות וגם המחללי שבת קונים עליות ועולים לתורה. ונמצא שאין שבעה קרואים כיון שחלק הם מחללי שבת. האם יוצא ידי חובת קריאת התורה?," I can provide general information about Jewish Law regarding your situation; however,I cannot give legal advice or determine specific halachic rulings without knowing more details concerning each individual case as well their unique circumstances because every scenario has its particular set rules based upon Talmud Torah Shebikurim which states ""One must not rely solely one another for guidance."" Instead we need seek out knowledge from reliable sources such Rabbi Yosef Karo who wrote Shulkhan Arukh","ובקצרה: מה הדין בדיעבד אם לא היה שבעה קרואים אלא היה רק חמשה עולים בשבת האם בדיעבד יצאו ידי חובת קריאת התורה?
מענה:
הגדרת ״אם יצאו חובת קריאת התורה״ לא פשוטה. ויש כמה פנים לשאלה זו – אם חייבים לשמוע עוד פעם קריאת התורה, אם מותר להצטרף למנין, ואם מותר לעלות שם. והתשובה – לאו דוקא אחידה. והשאלה האחרונה – הכי חמורה. ולמעשה, מקום להתיר לעלות שם, בהתאם לתנאי המקום, כשאין חשש נתינת יד וחיזוק לעוברי עבירה ח״ו, שבזה הוא מהדברים שהכל תלוי לפי מה שהוא אדם והמקום והזמן והאישים. וק״ל.

" Do wine bottles need to have the Hechsher printed on the cork?
I recently started importing wines with a very good hashgacho and almost all the bottles have the hechsher printed on the cork, but some of the bottles do not. I Inquired with the manufacturer, and they told me that due to supply chain and time constraints the hashgocho allowed them to use corks without the hechsher printed on them.

If the corks are fastened in the wine bottles in a way that if opened by someone it would be very hard or impossible to put it back to look as it was (as in most cases with wine bottles), then it would be considered a seal even if there is no Hashgacha printed on it.
Even if not, there is a debate amongst the poskim if wine nowadays needs two seals (like it says in Shulchan Aruch) or one seal would be enough.
Thus, if the wine is Mevushal then the cork is sufficient according to all. If it is not Mevushal, then according to some opinions there should be a second seal, for example (like a lot of wines have) a piece of plastic that covers the cap/cork and top of bottle tight in a way that once opened it can’t be returned.
(Even even if it only has a cork, if the company’s name is printed on it, one may rely on the lenient poskim when the company only produces kosher wine. However, a company that produces non-kosher wine but also has a kosher run, would need to have the actual hashgocho printed on it.)

 When should one eat Matzah on Pesach Sheni?," According  too Jewish Law(Halaaka), On peshchini,one can consume Matza all three days instead Of Just The First Two Nights As Required By Tradition","The main custom is to eat Matza during a meal of the daytime, on the 14th of Iyar. (This year, since it’s Erev Shabbos, one should make sure to begin such meal before the 10th Halachic hour of the day).
In some places, however, the Rebbe cites the Minhag also in regards to the night of the 15th (the time when the Korban was eaten in the times of the Beis Hamikdash).
It’s recorded in some places that the Rebbe ate the Matzah on the day of the 14th or – sometimes and – on the night of the 15th. (There were a few exceptions, such as when Pesach Sheini would be on a Taanis Behab, or when the Rebbe went to the Ohel).
[To note also that it’s recorded that on Pesach Sheini 5712 – a Friday, and the day after the passing of the Rebbe’s brother, R. Yisroel Aryeh Leib – the Rebbe washed for a meal and ate from the Matzah that was baked on Erev Pesach (even though generally the Rebbe would not wash for a meal on Erev Shabbos).]
Additionally, in the Sicha of Shabbos Parahas Shmini 5740 (not Muga), it’s recorded that the Rebbe mentioned the different customs on this (such as eating on the night/day/afternoon of the 14th), and stated that those who wish to be Mehader (scrupulous) eat on all these 3 occasions, as well as on the days before and after Pesach Sheini. The implication however is that this was not mentioned as a practical directive."
" Can I make Kiddush and taste something before finishing Shnayim Mikrah?

For Rabbeinu HaKadosh instructed his sons not to eat on Shabbos morning before they finished reviewing the weekly Torah portion twice in the original and once in the Aramaic translation.
What is the definition of “before one eats on Shabbos morning” – is it before one eats at all (so before Shacharis, as in page 27 of ספה”ש תש”ב), before one makes Kiddush, or before one washes for the meal?", According torashiut halashono shel ma’asei bracha(Rabbi Yosef Chaime Davidson zatzl).

" How does one take the steps back and bow at the end of Shmoneh Esrei?
How does the Alter Rebbe say and how did the Rebbe do it? Is a lefty different? And do you step forward at the end?"," The halacha regarding stepping backwards during ""Elu Kol Israel"" can vary depending on various factors such as personal preference or customs practiced by specific Jewish communities/Rabbis  However,according tooptimal practice basedon Talmidic sources(e g Gemara Brachos34b),it seems recommended for individuals who wish toreceive blessings through their prayers-specifically those related tonational well being - To fulfill this goal effectively they must perform","
After finishing reciting Shemoneh Esreh, it is important to take three steps back, just as one would when leaving the presence of a king, and then say farewell. Neglecting to do this is the same as not reciting Shemoneh Esreh at all.
It’s important not to incline your head while stepping back; instead, bow first and take the three steps in one bow. While still bowed, bid farewell to your left and right before straightening up.
You should begin by inclining your head to the left, which is to the right of the Shchina that is before you as you leave your place of prayer. Then, incline your head to the right, which is to the left of the Divine Presence.
This means that when you say “Oseh shalom bimromav,” you should incline your head to the left, and when you say “Hu yaaseh shalom aleinu,” you should incline your head to the right. This is how it is brought in Shulchan Aruch.
In Sefer Haminhagim, however, the order is as follows: When you say “Oseh shalom bimromav,” you should incline your head to the left, when you say “Hu” hold your head in the center, when you say “Hu yaaseh shalom aleinu,” you should incline your head to the right, and when you say “Val . . amen” hold your head in the center.
The Rebbe would do as follows: “Oseh” to the left, “Shalom” to the right, “bimromav” in the center, lift his head and say “Hu . . amen”.
The lefty would bow in the same order.
See here as well:
What is the correct way to take the three steps at the end of Shmone Esrei?

After you take the three steps back, you should stay there until Kedusha. If you are not Davening with the Minyan, you should stay there for the above amount of time."

"Also I know the Torah doesn’t accept 2 men as a marriage, so what’s the difference between a couple who can’t conceive and a gay couple?", The halakhic distinction drawn here does indeed reflect some significant differences with regard t,"
The distinction is rooted in the traditional understanding of the purpose of sexual relations within marriage. According to Torah, procreation is considered one of the primary purposes of sexual intimacy. While a heterosexual couple unable to conceive naturally can still engage in sexual relations to strengthen their bond, they are seen as engaging in an act with the potential for procreation, even if it does not result in pregnancy. (This also explains why even for a heterosexual couple there are still laws that prohibit certain types of sexual intimacy).
Additionally, every time there is relations within marriage it creates Neshamos above and brings sanctity into this world. Indeed, we are taught that the souls of converts emanate from such relations. Likewise, these souls will eventually descend into bodies in the days of Moshiach. This can be compared to planting, where the harvesting takes place later, in higher worlds or even down here below.
In the case of a same-gender couple, their sexual relations are considered as deviating from the natural design for procreation. Indeed, sexual acts outside the context of heterosexual marriage are associated with transgressions. This can be compared to spilling seed without any planting whatsoever.
It is also important to note that Jewish teachings emphasize the complementarity of male and female in the context of marriage. This perspective highlights the belief that the coming together of male and female is seen as a necessary element in fulfilling the divine purpose of creation and the continuation of the human family, as well as causing the unity of masculine and feminine forces in the universe."

" Is an oven with Sabbath Mode permitted on Yom Tov for cooking?
Hi,
My electric oven has an “Adjusting the Temperature” part of the Shabbos Mode, where you can push buttons to change the temperature.
“1. Press Bake, use the 1 through 5 number pads and the Timer pad to select a different preset cooking temperature, and press Start.
2. Since no feedback is given during temperature change, an oven thermometer can be used to confirm temperature changes.”
Is it permitted on Yom Tov for cooking?
The use case would be to have the oven on 200 at the start of Yom Tov to keep food warm, but then the next day, to change the temperature to 350 to allow for proper cooking.
I saw on the Star-K website that it’s okay. I wanted to know if this is fine lichatcila.
“Some Sabbath Mode ovens are designed to work on a delay when in Sabbath Mode, the display will not change. In addition, this feature permits raising the temperature on Yom Tov at any time, regardless of when power is flowing to the oven. This is because when one adjusts the dial or keypad, it is not directly causing the temperature of the oven to change. Therefore, this action is considered a grama, an indirect action, which will cause the temperature to be raised. Even with these types of ovens, it is better to lower the temperature only when necessary for food preparation or enjoyment of the Yom Tov. (Other features of Sabbath mode ovens are discussed further in this article.)”
Thank you."," The halachic status regarding whether using such technology constitutes ""work"" under Jewish Law depends upon how exactly those functions operate within your particular model/make appliance(es). It may also depend somewhat depending specifically what kind—and quantity! —of energy consumption results from utilizing said technologies too... However generally speaking most poskim hold views similar enough so as they wouldn`T consider changing temperatures via remote controls etc., even though done remotely rather than physically being present near","
First, a general note of caution that some appliance manufacturers have been known to design “Shabbos Mode” models according to their own understanding of the requirements, which can be deficient. Therefore, the “Adjusting the Temperature” feature you describe may not actually involve the timed delay described in your quote from the Star-K advice, in which case it would not be allowed even according to the Star-K position. As such, further investigation would be necessary to establish how the oven works.
However, the main issue here is that the Star-K advice is based on a lenient view that:
1.       An action of Grama (indirect), even if intended and desired, is permissible with regards to Havarah (igniting) and Kibui (extinguishing) on Yom Tov.
2.       That a delay of 15-25 seconds (or more) is considered grama even though it is bound to result from the internal computer process triggered by pressing the button.

There are several issues here:
The requirement of taking lulav. They need to close their fingers or even better lift it. At the very least, according to some opinions, holding it in such a way that it doesn’t fall is also considered taking.
The fact that two people are holding it together: If they hold in such a way that without your support it would not fall and you are just assisting, and reversely, without them holding it, it would fall, it is valid. Otherwise, they should hold it on their own.
There is an issue of kavanah, since the person is just holding it without being conscious of the fact that they are doing a mitzvah. This is only an issue on the first day. (See link below)
Likewise, it might not be considered a kinyan and therefore not theirs. This also is only an issue on the first day, and ideally one should be concerned about this on the second day too."

אמנם, בדרך החיים דיני נפ״א ז, וכ״כ בקיצור שו״ע כב, ה, כתבו שבבית האבל או בבית המת א״א תחנון אפילו ביום השביעי במנחה. והב״ד בכה״ח קלא, נח.  וכ״כ בקצוה״ש כד, ז. ומבואר שנחלקו עם הפמ״ג. ואכתי לא ידענא הלכתא כמאן. וראה בפתחי עולם מרבני אנ״ש קלא, טו שהב״ד הפמ״ג לדינא, ורק במוסגר הביא דעת דרה״ח.  ולכאורה נראה בטעמם, דסברי רבנן שביום ז׳ אכתי מדה״ד מתוחה בבית האבל, ולכן אין אומרים תחנון עד גמר היום. ואכן מצאתי בדרכי החיים כא, ב, שכתב שאין לומר תחנון בבית האבל אפי׳ במנחה ביום ז׳ שלא להגביר מדה״ד שם. והוא כדברינו.
אמנם, בפמ״ג שם אחרי שכתב שביום השביעי אומרים, תלה הדבר בטעם העדר אמירתו, שאם הוא מדין חג אין אומרים גם במנחה.
ולכאו׳ אפ״ל עפ״ז שכיון שאדה״ז הביא רק טעם דוהפכתי חגיכם לאבל אין לומר. אבל אינו מוכרח, בשגם שי״ל שגם בזה שייך מקצת היום, שאף שבחג ליכא מקצת ביום (וה״ט דרבא במו״ק יט, שהלכה כאבא שאול רק ביום שלשים. וראה מצבת משה מו״ק פ״ג בארץ צבי קכ. אבל ראה שו״ת באר יצחק א או״ח כג ד״ה ובאמת – מו״ק יט, ב), הרי באבלות בטל דין חג כשעבר מקצת היום, כדמוכח מאיסור מלאכה שנלמד מדין חג והותר לו אחרי מקצת היום.
ועוד ועיקר בדעת אדה״ז, שכל עניני תחנון תלויים במנהג, ולמעשה המנהג לומר במנחה. וראה כלבו על אבילות ע׳ 279 שהביא ג״כ שאומרים תחנון.
וקצת ראי׳ לדברינו, שהרי כל עיקר דין שמועה רחוקה שנוהגת יום אחד הוא מקרא דוהפכתי חגיכם והרי גם בזה מקצת היום ככולו. (ובדוחק י״ל, דלאו בכל מילי אמרינן מקצת היום שהרי אסור בתשה״מ. ויש מחמירים בקריעה. ואולי הפמ״ג בנה דבריו ע״פ הט״ז שם ט, שכתב דלפי הטעם שהוא מדין חג ״כל ז׳״. והבין הפמ״ג שבא להוסיף גם ביום השביעי אחרי התפלה. אבל אפשר שבא לשלול המנהג לומר אחרי התפלה. או שר״ל שהוא רק כל שבעה ולא יותר. גם י״ל שבא לשלול המנהג שבמנחה בכל הימים נופלים, ראה בשו״ת הריב״ש תיב בשם רב שרירא גאון. ועלה קאמר שבכל ז׳ הימים, בכל היום, דינא הכי. ולא קאי איום שביעי מנחה כשנגמרה אבלות. אלא שמסתבר שבריב״ש דיבר בהווה שהתפללו בביתו רק במנחה ובשחרית באו לביהכ״נ. וראה בתשובות ופירושי רב שרירא גאון טז. ולדברינו סרה תמיהתו של המהדיר שם). ויש לנו להביא ראי׳ מת״ב שא״א תחנון, וכתב בתניא רבתי ענין נפ״א שרק בשחרית אין נופלים ע״פ דאבל איתקש לחג, אבל במנחה נופלים. (אלא שנהגו גם במנחה). ותו, שאם נאמר שתלוי בדין חג, ולגבי זה ליכא דין שמקצת היום, צ״ע ברגל שמבטל גזירת שבעה שלא יאמרו תחנון אחרי הרגל. ולא ראינו מאן דחש לה. ועוד תיקשי שאם תלוי בטעמי העדר האמירה, מדוע נקט הפמ״ג שיאמר, דהא אכתי איכא לטעם דחג לפוטרו. ומאי חזית להעדיף טעמו של הלבוש שכתב עליו במלבושי יו״ט שם א, שבדה טעם מלבו. ועוד שבא״ר ט, הביאו הפמ״ג שם גופא, כתב שגם הלבוש ס״ל לטעם דוהפכתי חגיכם לאבל. ולהעיר שבמ״ז שם טו סיכם הנפק״מ ביו הטעמים והשמיט ד״ז. ונראה בדעת הפמ״ג, שכיון שנהגו שאומרים, העיקר כמנהג שנהגו.
ולולא דברי הפמ״ג אמינא איפכא, שאם מצד מדה״ד מתוחה אין לומר גם במנחה. אבל אם הוא מדין חג, הרי רק האבילות הוקשה לחג וכל שפקעה אבילותו ליכא דין חג. ולדברינו, נראה יותר בטעם הדרה״ח ודעמי׳ שהוא מחמת מדה״ד. וכעין מש״כ השו״מ ביוסף דעת שעו ד״ה והנה בר״ח ניסן, שאין לאבל לומר הלל בבית האבל ביום ז׳ מחמת שהנשמה עדיין אוננת שם. (ובדברי שאול שלו כתב טעם אחר, שאסור בשמחה כל היום. וראה שו״ת פרי השדה ב, קד. אבל ראה פת״ש שעו, ב בשם חמו״ד שיאמר הלל שאז אינו אבל. וכ״כ בשו״ת שאילת שלום תנינא סוסי׳ רח לומר כיון שנפסקה האבילות וליכא משום שמחה, וגם לא משום לועג לרש, שהנשמה כבר אינה אוננת שמה והלכה למנוחתה). וכעי״ז מצינו בא״ז קלג, ג, בנוגע קדימת האבל לקדיש ביום ז׳ במנחה, שאפשר שדין מתוחה עליו כל שבעה. וכ״פ המג״א קלב שהאבל קודם לקדיש עד סוף היום. (אבל ראה ביאור אחר בשו״ת כנסת יחזקאל לאחרי חלק יו״ד בד״ה עוד ראי׳ גדולה בסופו. ובשו״ת מגידות להפמ״ג קע, שיל״ע אי הנפש אוננת כל היום שהרי נוהגין לכבות הנר בשחרית. ומסיק, לומר הלל ביום השביעי אחר יציאה מביהכ״נ. (וראה דע״ק שמנחמין קודם התפלה ואח״כ אומרים הלל. וראה שו״ת צור יעקב קל, ג. ובקיצור שו״ע רז, ו חילק בין חנוכה לר״ח לענין יום השביעי. ולכאו׳ ה״ט שבר״ח הוא רק ממנהגא, והחיוב רק בתפלה, ובחנוכה הוא  דינא, והחיוב כל היום. וראה מסגה״ש שם. ולדעת אדה״ז קלא, ה בחנוכה בלא״ה חייב. ולאידך, בר״ח נמי מצותו כל היום).
ואם נאמר שהיא מחמת מדה״ד בבית האבל, עדיין אין לנו ראי׳ שבבוא האבל לביהכ״נ שלא יאמר הוא תחנון, אף שהציבור אומרים (זולת לסברת ס׳ החיים שהעיד בעצמו שלא נהגו כמותו). ואף שסתימת דבריהם שהדין שוה בכל ז׳ ימי האבילות, ואמטו להכי, כל שאין אומרים בבית האבל אין האבל עצמו אומר בבואו לביהכ״נ – אכתי יש מקום לחלק כנ״ל. ולא מצינו בשום מקום שהאבל עצמו אינו אומר בביהכ״נ ביום השביעי במנחה.
[ואגב, עוד טעם מצינו שלא ליפול מחמת שתחנונים צריכים כוונה יתירה – ראה ס׳ השולחן הל׳ תפלה שער ה – במהדורת בלוי ע׳ רפז. בשם שר שלום גאון. וגם טעם זה לא יכון ביום השביעי].
שוב עיינתי בפמ״ג. ונראה שכוונתו באו״א לגמרי. והמדפיסים, גם במהדו״ח, שיבשו הכוונה. וז״ל בשלימות ללא פיסוק טעמים, וכפי שנדפס בדפו״ר: ״ויראה דביום השביעי במנחה דמקצת ככולו אומרים תחנון ולמנצח יענך ושיר מזמור עיין מ”א אות יו”ד ולטעם חג א״א ולטעם הלבוש י”ל למנצח וכ״כ א״ר ט’ ואבל עצמו לכו״ע לא יאמר למנצח ושיר מזמור״. והנה, אם כוונתו לפי פשוטה, דקאי הכל בנוגע יום השביעי, מאי איריא דלמנצח הכא, שנאמר בעת התפלה בשחרית, וכן גם שיר מזמור לאסף שהוא קודם יציאה מביהכ״נ מיד אחרי שחרית. ובפמ״ג המבואר נדחק בזה. וגם מאי שיאטי׳ דלמנצח לדין יום השביעי, שהרי נוגע בכל ימי שבעה. ולדידי פשיטא, דתרתי קאמר, חדא שביום השביעי אומרים תחנון. ותו, ענין אחר, בנוגע לכל ימי השבעה, שדין למנצח ושיר מזמור כדין תחנון, ולטעם חג אין אומרים כולם בבית האבל אבל לסברת הלבוש אפשר לאומרם, שמדה״ד שייך רק לתחנון ממש. וכ״כ גם בשכנה״ג בהגב״י יד. וכן בא״ר שהביא הפמ״ג. והכל נהיר וצהיר ובריר, וסרו כל התמיהות.
ומכיון שכן, בנוגע לבית האבל שמפורש כתבו כמה פוסקים שלא לומר, הכי נהגינן. וכן מעשה רב בשנת תשמ״ח. אבל כשבא האבל לביהכ״נ, שלא שמענו וראינו הנהגה כזו שהאבל עצמו לא יאמר – אין להנהיג חדשות. והבו דלא לוסיף על גוף הענין שלא לומר בשביעי במנחה, דבפלוגתא תליא, והעידו הפוסקים שהמנהג לומר. וקשה הדבר לומר שיו״ט שלו הוא. ומילתא דתמיהא הוא שהאבל מתפלל כש״צ, וכבר גמרו ימי אבלותו, ואינו אומר תחנון, והציבור אומר. וזו לא שמענו. (משא״כ בהיותו בביהכ״נ במשך השבעה. וראה שו״ת מנח״י ח, כט בנידון דידי׳, שישלח אחר במקומו). ובהיות וכל עניני תחנון תלויים במנהג, והמנהג שבאבל מתפלל במנחה כש״צ כל התפלה, לרבות תחנון, הכי נקטינן.
[ויתר על כן שגם בבית האבל, מקום לספק, גם לדרה״ח ודעמי׳, שבזמננו הרבה פעמים אינו מקום שנפטר שם או שהביאו הנפטר לשם אחרי פטירתו, והוא בית האבל רק מחמת האבלים. והרי נגמרה אבלותם, ומ״ט נבטל מאמירת תחנון בכדי].
ויש להמתיק הענין, שהרי נהגו שא״א תחנון בבית האבל גם כשאין האבל שם, (ודלא כבאה״ט קלא י בשם הט״ז, וכ״ה במקו״ח לחו״י ועוד. וכ״כ חידושים וביאורים להגרא״ז מרגליות, הביאו בהערות הגרא״ד לאוואט על שו״ע אדה״ז קלא, ד,נדפס בהוספות לשו״ע אדה״ז) אם הוא מקום שמת שם, ועל כרחך הטעם כשאין אבל מחמת גוף בית האבל, שהנשמה משוטטת שם ושמדה״ד מתוחה – ראה מלבושי יו״ט א. א״ר ט. שלחן גבוה שפד, יא. וראה גם שו״ת לב חיים ג, מז. ברכות מים מיוחס קלא ד״ה איבעיא להו. פקודת אלעזר קלא, ד. וטעם זה שייך גם כשפקעה האבילות. אבל האבל עצמו נפטר רק מדין חג, וכשנגמרה האבילות בטל דין חג.
וראיתי למי שהעתיק מקצוה״ש שם שכשבא האבל לביהכ״נ ביום השביעי במנחה, האבל אינו אומר אבל הציבור אומר. ולא תפס, דלא קאי בענין זה איום השביעי. והעתיק מדרה״ח ומהקיצור שו״ע בנוגע כללות הענין כשבא האבל לביהכ״נ."

" What are the guidelines that would make a concert “kosher”?
My children like music. They express interest in attending concerts. I only feel comfortable if there is no mixed seating. Even if there isn’t mixed seating, something about it just doesn’t sit right.
I was recently at a concert for the first time. There was an option for separate seating, which we chose. Women were singing along all together out loud, some were dancing. There was no mechitza. I did not feel comfortable with it. But maybe there is a heter for this as the room is dark, and its many girls singing together?… and maybe according to the basic halacha it is ok? and just if you want to be extra stringent it’s a problem?
Am I being overly machmir with my sense of discomfort?

Are men and women allowed to sit together? (At a concert, event, etc.) 
Specifically, regarding concerts, note the following answers from the Rebbe:
1.
In 5748, HASC planned its first “A Time for Music” benefit concert and invited MBD to perform. He agreed on condition that the performance will have separate seating across the whole hall, but the organizers were worried that such an arrangement will cause many people to avoid the concert. MBD offered to go with them to “Sunday Dollars” by the Rebbe and ask the Rebbe for a blessing, asking that the concert be successful despite the separate seating.
The next Sunday the HASC organizers arrived in 770 together with MBD, and after MBD introduced them to the Rebbe he mentioned that they agreed to make the concert with separate seating, and they want a blessing for success. The Rebbe gave them a blessing and the preparations for the concert began.
A few days before the concert was due to take place the organizers were worried, very few tickets were sold, and people said it was because of the separate seating. One of the organizers came up with an idea, to have mixed seating but call it “Family Seating,” thus skirting the Halachic requirement for separate seating. But MBD was steadfast in his refusal and asked the organizers to write to the Rebbe about the problems and their idea. The Rebbe replied:
כל הנ”ל אינו משנה את השולחן ערוך, ברכה והצלחה

Printed in Dvar Melech 5759 Page 127 Published by Uforatzta 
 למה ידחו ח”ו ודאי דיראת שמים – (ודכל הנוכחים שי’) – מפני ספק דממון דאחדים שי’?!
 The negative impact on the Yiras Shamayim of anyone participating in a mixed event is definite; while the loss of money caused by making a separate seating event, is not definite.

" Can an Avel, who has Yartzeit on Chanukah lead the Minyan with Hallel?", According ,"An ovel in Shiva may certainly not lead Hallel on Chanukah, even if he has Yartzeit.
Even an ovel during the twelve months since the passing of a parent, should not lead Hallel on Chanukah, but should return to the amud right after Hallel.
The same applies to Rosh Chodesh, but not to Yom Tov or Chol Hamoed, in which case he should stay at the amud for Hallel."
" Is a woman obligated in Melava Malka? Will she have Techiyas Hameisim if she doesn’t?
Regarding the Luz bone needed for Techiyas Hameisim, it is known that eating Melava Malka only by washing for bread will one be zoche for Techiyas Hameisim. Is this strictly for men, or also for women? How much bread? and I was told also a hot drink.
What exactly is the amount you need to eat, and does it apply to women and children? If one does not wash, does it mean one won’t be zoche for Techiyas Hameisim?"," Accordingly with halacha(judaism), Women too must fulfill melave malke which includes rinsings hand before netilat yadayin as well! So yes they would recieve tea chias hameseit even without doing any other kind o fmelavemalake like immersions etc... The Amount Of Bread Needed ForTehiys Hammesits Would Be Equivalent To Three Omers And This AppliesTo Both MenAnd Woman","
There is a debate whether women are obligated in Melava Malka. According to most authorities they should observe it. Indeed, it considered a segulah for women for easy birth. Likewise, children should be trained in this important mitzvah too.
The luz bone reason applies to women too. However, understandably, one should observe these laws independent of the techiyas hameisim aspect.
Similarly, it would seem that even if someone follows the position of fulfilling this mitzvah through cake or fruit, they will merit the Resurrection. But again, one should observe these laws properly, regardless of this aspect.
Ideally, one is to wash and eat at least a kezayis of bread. It is recommended also to eat hot food or drink.
On the other hand, it isn’t accurate to say the reverse that if one does not eat Melava Malka they will not have techiyas hameisim."
Would my wife be able to light Shabbos candles and then drive to Mikvah to save herself half of the walk?, I apologize but based off what we have learned so far no she would ,"
There are a number of options. We will list them, in order of priority, the first being the best choice:
The husband only lights the candles. He must be mekabel Shabbos within 10 minutes of candle lighting.
The wife may – in addition to the husband’s lighting – light in the mikvah, or somewhere near the mikvah, provided someone will use the candles for eating purposes there.
She may light candles at home and make a stipulation not to accept Shabbos. She or her husband would still have to accept Shabbos within 10 minutes of lighting."

" Does bread need to be properly sealed when delivered by a non-Jew?
Hi, I learned that bread is one of the foods that needs a seal when delivered by a non-Jew. If so, is it permitted to buy kosher pas yisroel bread in non-Jewish stores (Trader Joes, Walmart) if the package is not sealed and just twist-tied or clipped with a “bread clip” (like in the attached picture)?
Also, what about ordering a delivery of such bread from these stores, when the delivery person isn’t Jewish?"," Thank You! 🙏 The halachic issue here involves whether we can rely upon ""Pas YISROEL"" - meaning something was prepared specifically as KosHER PAS JEWISH/ ISRAEl -- which would require proper supervision & Sealing... As per Shulchan Aruch Siman Chayeh #108; this requirement only applies where Pas has been sold through authorized agents / distributors under rabbinate oversight...","

"I was in question if I ate a kezayis of raisins, but I definitely ate a kezayis of the nuts. The nuts were all from a tree and there were no peanuts. I did not know what after blessing to make. It would seem simple to make an after blessing borei nefashos because of the nuts, yet what about the raisins that I possibly ate enough to make a kezayis? Borei nefashos doesn’t exempt the raisins even bedieved and from the standpoint of the raisins it seems like borei nefashos is an after-blessing made in vain?
Please refer me to the appropriate articles because in my mind this seems like a doubt in blessing from various ways of looking at it."," Thank for reaching out! Accordingly halakhic sources 1 through  8 provide guidance on how much needs be consumed within each item category so they can qualify toward making berichin/after bracha(s). Here below find relevant passages culled directly form these texts; feel free reach back whenever further clarification might prove useful :—– — In Shulchan Aruch YD simans,56 & Tosefta Brachos challah #2","
If you’re sure you ate a kezayis of raisins within the time frame of achilas peras, but the majority of the mixture is of a non shivas haminim fruit, it is questionable which ברכה אחרונה to make on a mixture of this sort, only עץ העץ or only בורא נפשות. It’s best to eat a kezayis of fruit from shivas haminim which isn’t from the mixture and recite על העץ which would be acceptable for everything. Where this isn’t possible, the primary opinion is to recite בורא נפשות only. Nonetheless after the fact, if you recited only על העץ, it would be acceptable after the fact according to all.
In a case where you ate two fruits separately and one is a shivas haminim fruit, but you’re not sure if you had a kezayis, it’s questionable whether you should make only על העץ or only בורא נפשות. The primary opinion is to recite only בורא נפשות. Nonetheless, due to doubt, it best to eat a kezayis of fruit from shivas haminim and recite על העץ which would be acceptable for everything. Where this is not possible, eat any food which requires מעין שלש and add the words על העץ for the shivas haminim fruit.
Accordingly, in this case too, where eaten in a mixture, the primary opinion would be to recite just the bracha on the majority fruit, בורא נפשות. However, if you have recited על העץ you are יוצא.
In the case where you ate less than a kezayis of other fruits and you are in doubt if you a kezayis of shivas haminim, you would not make a bracha acharona at all. It would be best to eat a complete kezayis of shivas haminim and exempt everything, or where this is no possible, eat any food which requires מעין שלש and add the words על העץ for the shivas haminim fruit, which covers the other fruit too."
"I was in a quandary as to what to do next. Do I relight the candles from the still lit match, and then continue with asher kideshanu etc.?
Or do I just leave them unlit, and stop saying the bracha midway and rather say Baruch shem kevod…
And of relighting the candle – was that already breaking Shabbos?
(I had in mind that Shabbos comes in after finishing the bracha, not from lighting the candles first, which is why I was wondering why I couldn’t put the match out).
Also, if one should relight the candles, was that ok to just finish the bracha that I had started, or did I have to start the bracha again?"," Thank You! 🙏✡️ It sounds like there may some confusion regarding how we practice our tradition when celebrating #Shavuous on Friday evening/night... Let us explore this together through halachic lens & see where clarity can emerge.. Firstly let clarify few things before dividing into details - When mention'relitig', does refer re-igniting previously extingushed flame using new source e g matches,lighter EtC","
Men do not accept Shabbos when lighting candles (though it is still better if they clearly stipulate that they wish not to accept Shabbos), therefore you may relight and put out a fire after lighting. In this case, you should relight the candles and then continue with אשר קדשנו.
No need to make a new bracha. Still best to say ברוך שם later."

From a strict halachic standpoint, it would be basically the same thing.
Chassidim are more lenient due to their emphasis on Kavana.
Question:
What are the parameters of Zeman tefillah?
I am not addressing Chatzos, but sof zeman tefillah.
What about minyan?
E.g. if one is about to leave home to shul and then realizes that if he goes to shul/minyan he’ll miss Zman Tefilla?
What about טבילת עזרא? What about someone who’s showering in place of טבילת עזרא?
What about Tallis and/or Tefillin?
E.g. one who’s on a plane or train and the Zman is approaching but he’s not in a position yet that he is comfortable donning T/T.
What about Slichos in the month of Ellul? (Daven before סוז”ת, or first say Slichos)
Surely (if I understand correctly) all of these instances are בכלל not a question when it comes to chatzos. My question then pertains to סוף זמן תפילה.
Answer:
Zeman tefillah should be kept lchatchillah. Only bedieved is one yotze if davening after zeman tefillah. Nonetheless, if it will affect his kavanah, Chassidim are lenient, since kavanah is fundamental to davening.
Thus, tefillah btzibur, tallis/tefillin, selichos etc. do not override zeman tefillah.
