"If an adult takes vitamins daily, is it ok to take on Shabbos?","
No. One should not consume anything new or any medicine during shabbas.</s> – <a href=”https://www321854079-mycms–prod6bxd—siteswizardrycom/judaism_and___shbbas</u></p>. However if one was taking them before Yom Tov and forgot that they needn’t be taken then he may continue doing so until after Mincha of Erev Rosh Chodeshes but ideally by midday at latest as in such case there will have been מעלה שנית for all purposes including halachically regarding medication even though this isn'm mentioned explicitly here; nevertheless some Poskim hold likewise with regard specifically only their actual consumption - see above also where I mention about other issues which apply when forgetting whether something needs refraining from being done while keeping kasher etc.) See","
There is a dispute among poskim about this. Therefore it should not be done unless necessary.
It is advisable always to take one before Shabbos and one after."
"1. Seforim of shas that are not in order, can they be organized on Shabbos? What if its tzorech harabim? Perhaps home is also tzorech harabim as people might come? And why are two mesechtos considered 2 minim?
2. What about not taking a Chumash in the beginning of davening, I’ve read that it might be an issue of Borer – but that means that I won’t have a Chumash and is similar to allowing a caterer to do borer samuch l’achila much before eating as he needs more time, (similarly, with Chumash, it is otherwise impossible).","
Answers below by Rabbi Elazar Mordechi Hacohen.</s> A few points regarding your questions are worth mention here briefly for clarification purposes; these answers should serve only general guidance rather than halakhic advice specific or binding ruling from our own rabbi unless explicitly stated so at their conclusion respectively.]</p></div><br clear=”all""></small<sup id=""_Ref-0"">[ref][] [[/su]]][// ref list starts], [3958764]. For further details see therein including references throughout this section which will help one understand how different approaches may differ within chabad when comparing each other along various lines while considering both sides valid opinions depending upon contextual circumstances without necessarily choosing between them because we follow whatever approach best suits us based soleily around what works out well even though some issues remain open despite having found common ground elsewhere especially concerning those who live outside Israel where local conditions vary greatly","
1. Taking out one Sefer from a mixture of other Seforim is an act of Borer (according to many Poskim). Thus if you pull 1 out from between 2 others in order to put it in the correct place, you are doing Borer. If they are scattered on the table, or on the shelf in the case where they are standing separately not mixed together, then it is not Borer.
However, you are not allowed to organize it for after Shabbos. If it’s important that it looks neat for Shabbos itself it may be done (without Borer).
Two masechtos are really two seperate seforim (that are part of a set). Thus choosing one from a mixture of others is Borer.
2. In the case where the Chumash is standing separately on the shelf, or if all the Chumashim are the same, it is permitted regardless as explained above. You can use it a bit before davening to avoid the issue."
"Q. In a minyan of just kohanim, does the second aliyah go for the same kohen that received rishon (“bimkom levi“) or we can give it to two different kohanim?","
A1 – B’dieved only if there is no other option available and one cannot rely on any leniency which may exist in this matter.</s>",A. Must be given to the same Kohen.
" If an Avel is davening in Shul and being Chazzan, should the Minyan say Tachnun?","
Yes. Even though he’s not saying anything out loud they still recite tahannis for him.</see> דף אותך</a></p><br clear=”all “/><div class=""w-10"">שנהגם – This was done by many people who were familiar with this custom of our ancestors as well those that saw it practiced later on during their lifetime like Rabbi Chaim Yosef David Azriel Hacohen or others similar examples can be found from other Poskim such Rebbe Melech HaRashi etc... However if one doesn't see any benefit there isn&rsquo;e no need since its just something we did but didn''t have much reason behind why! In fact some Rabbans wrote about how even when doing Kaddishes without singing aloud - nonetheless says them verbally because sometimes words escape his mouth while reading which would cause confusion so","If the Minyan is in the Shul not because of the Avel, Tachanun is recited. It’s best if the Avel walks out for Tachanun.
If the minyan assembled there only for him, Tachanun shouldn’t be said."
" Regarding a Pidyon Haben, If four silver coins together are more than 100 grams is there a reason to have 5 coins?","
If it’s for Kiddushin then no. The minimum amount of money that can be used as pidyan haben must equal or exceed two zuzim.</span>","There is no reason to have 5 coins (though some are strict to have 120 grams).

" How careful should one be about Davening with droplets of urine on his clothing?
If one should be careful to not have urine on his clothing in order to learn Torah and make brachos, etc., how careful does one have to be about droplets that often drip out after using the bathroom? What can one do if there are often droplets even after shaking out?","
It is forbidden for him or her who has gone through mikveh from washing themselves before they go into it. Even when he goes home without changing clothes first.</s>”</i></p><br,”} נמין – It’d seem this applies only where water drips off them immediately as soon as possible; however sometimes these small quantities will still remain stuck underneath their garments until removed by hand later at night during bedtime cleanliness rituals such us wipings down surfaces while lay flat/lying back onto pillow top mattresses covered overtop other blankets including duvies too! This practice may also include any residual moisture left behind either directly above another layer beneath layers upon bedsheeves which isn't always fully dry due its direct contact against body heat emitted via persistence throughout day long activities especially those spent indoors away far enough outside world so we need extra protection","
According to the strict halacha this is not a problem if it’s covered in the garments one is wearing.
Nevertheless, there were pious individuals who would be particular about drops of urine in their clothing, in order that they daven with clean clothing.
This is only an issue if it is noticeable on the outside, or wet enough that it would make another item wet. Certainly once it dries it’s not a problem anymore.
If you practice regular normal hygiene this is not an issue."
" Would it be a hefsek to wait for family members and guests to wash their hands between my washing and hamotzie?
If so, would drying my hands for extra long during that time fix the problem (because niguv is considered part of the netila)?","
It’s not necessary. You may start your meal with Netilas Yadayim without waiting on them.</p>","
It’s not a hefsek.
The Rosh had a custom to wash last in order to minimize the pause between washing and hamotzi, but this is not a requirement.
It’s advisable to continue drying hands during the wait."
" Can one Toivel Keilim while undressed?
I’ve seen many people bring dishes to the mikvah to toivel, after they first go to the mikvah. Is it a problem to toivel keilim while undressed? And if it’s ok, what about a Bracha? Or maybe only for dishes we wouldn’t need to make a Bracha for?","
You may not immerse in any Mikva by yourself when naked or half-nakeds unless there is no other option and your life depends on this action as well.</span>","
Besides the fact that many men’s mikvaos are not suitable for immersing Keilim, if it is a Keli which requires a Bracha, one may not Tovel it while being undressed.
If the Mikva is in fact kosher for immersing Keilim, the Bracha should be made out of the Mikva and one should immediately walk to the Mikva and immerse the keli(m).
Because of safety issues, many mikvaos have rules against immersing Keilim in the Mikva used for men (or women) and they must be adhered to. Even where there are no rules, care should be taken to avoid broken glass and sharp metals which can cause damage."
 Can a person in Aveilus (during the first 30 days) eat the Purim Seuda not at home?,"
Yes. If it is impossible for him/her due other reasons such as work etc., he may be lenient and go out of his house on that day if there’s no alternative way.</sm>","Yes, if they normally eat out for Seudas Purim. Even one who doesn’t normally eat out on Purim, if the cost of eating at home is prohibitive, or if one is alone at home, they may join a seudah out of their home. Likewise, if invited out to family and the family will be very upset if they don’t attend there is room for leniency too.
Regarding dancing, see here."
"If a person cannot drink alcohol, what recommendations are there for them to fulfill the mitzvah of עד ולא ידע so that it affects their body on Purim?","
There is no such thing as “not being able or allowed” when talking about an actual commandment. If one has health problems and therefore needs medical supervision while consuming wine during purims celebration then they should consult with his doctor before doing this.</span>","
In this case, they’re exempt from the literal interpretation of עד דלא ידע. However, it should be noted that the Rebbe asked that Bachurim under 40 fulfill this mitzvah through “true wine”, the wine of Torah. In Sefer Hamamorim 5679 the Rebbe Rashab explains that עד דלא ידע is fulfilled through the soul enjoying Pnimiyus HaTorah and through a tremendous love to Hashem, אהבה בתענוגים. In Igros Kodesh vol. III p. 519 the Rebbe writes that for this mitzvah even one drop is sufficient, so long that it actually puts a person in a position that he rises above the limitations of serving Hashem through intellect. The Rebbe continues that if one really wants to act this way even one drop is sufficient and if chas vshalom someone doesn’t want even a full barrel won’t help.

" If I’m reading Megillah and a nearby Minyan is saying Kedusha, what should I do?","
If it can be done without causing any embarrassment or disruption of their services one may say Amen on his own. The Chida says that this applies even if they have not yet started Shemonah Esrei.</s>","Q. Can one be yotze Megillah if there are other minyanim and they are saying Kedusha etc.?
A. If you make sure to hear every single word, though it could be quite difficult and this setup is not recommended.
Q. So does that mean that if I do hear a Kaddish or something else I need not answer it?
A. The halachos for answering are the same as during birchos krias shema, i.e. you should only answer אמן יהא שמיה רבא, דאמירן בעלמא, קדוש ברוך ימלוך, etc.
This applies only if you are reading the megillah.

ואקדים ואומר, דהא גופא שד״ז נזכר רק בדיני פסוד״ז מוכיח דלאו כללא הוא בכ״מ. ובפשטות, לא הוו שתקו הפוסקים מלהודיענו ד״ז, בדבר הרגיל ושכיח טובא. והטעם להחילוק, שהרי אעיקרא דמילתא מצינו בראשונים גירסאות שונות בברכות ד, ב, אם צ״ל תהלה לדוד ״ג״פ בכ״י״ או ״בכל יום״ גרידא. (וראה גם גליון הש״ס לרעק״א שם. וראה לקו״ש יח ע׳ 351 הע׳ 2. שם ע׳ 352 בהערות 13-14). ויתר על כן בראבי״ה א, ד, כתב שנהגו לומר ג״פ, אבל בגמ׳ גרסינן רק ״בכל יום״. ואמטו להכי איכא למימר, שלא חייבוהו לחזור רק במקום שאמירתו חובה (או תקנה קדומה עכ״פ). ואפי׳ תימא כגי׳ שאר הראשונים שגרסו ג״פ – הרי עד כאן לא שמענו אלא שמובטח לו שהוא בן עוה״ב, ולא שחובה בדבר. וא״כ איך אפשר לחייבו לחזור בדבר שכל עיקר אמירתו אינו מדינא ממש. ואף שבתר״י ברכות (כג, א בדפי הרי״ף) כשהביא בשם הגאונים שצריך לחזור ולאומרו, קאי אריש דבריו שהביא ל׳ הגמ׳ לאומרו ג״פ – לאו בחדא מחתא מחתינהו. ובשגם שברי״ף שם נמצא הגי׳ שלש פעמים, ובהערה שעה״ג שבדפו״ר ליתא כן. והה״נ בתר״י שאין הכרח שכך גירסתו. (ולכשתימצי לומר, נמצא לפ״ז שבפוסקים שלא הובא תיבות ג״פ משמע שהחזרה עוה״פ היא רק באמירתו בפסוד״ז). ואשכחן טובא, ששינו בספרים והוסיפו וכתבו ״ג״פ בכ״י״ כגי׳ הנפוצה בגמ׳ (ראה גהש״ס שם שציין לטור, ולפנינו הוסיפו בטור. וכן ציין שם לרוקח שכ, אף ששם שכד כתב ג״פ. והמענה בזה, כבראבי״ה שם שאף דל״ג לה בגמ׳ מ״מ במציאות נהגו לאומרו ג״פ. וכבר העירו ממעשה רוקח ר״ה קכד, שכתב שכן הגיהו בברכות, ובספרים ישנים אינו).
ואכתי יל״ע קצת בדבר, שבאר״ח (דיני תחנות ומזמורים שאחר תפלת י״ח ג) כתב בטעם האמירה ג״פ שאם לא כיוון בראשון יכוון באחרונות. וכ״ה באשכול (מהדורת אוירבאך כד – ע׳ נג). וכ״מ בתשו׳ ר״ג גאון שם, במש״כ שם בטעמא דמילתא שמא יפשע (אבל י״ל שכוונתו שיפשע ולא יאמר כלל, ראה עד״ז בפסקי הרי״ד ובשלה״ג שם. שבה״ל ענין תפלה ז. תניא רבתי ב. ועוד). וראה גם בברכ״י נא, ה בשם תפארת שמואל על הרא״ש ברכות ה, ו. ומשמע קצת דכולהו כחדא נינהו. ואכן בכה״ח שם לג כתב עפ״ז שבלא כיוון בפסוד״ז יש לו תשלומין אח״כ. אבל מדברי שאר הפוסקים נראה ברור דלא ס״ל כוותי׳, ושצריך לחזור ולאומרו ואין לסמוך להשלים אח״כ. ואיהו חשש משום הפסק כדרכו בקודש, ולא קייל״ן הכי. (וראה ישועו״י נא, א). ואיך שיהי׳, אין לנו הכרח שהחיוב לחזור קאי גם אשארא, גם לדעת הראשונים הנ״ל, אא״כ לא כיוון בב״פ הראשונות. (ובדעת כה״ח – ראה להלן). ואדרבה, לדידהו הרי גם בקדמייתא אין חובה לחזור. (ואולי אפשר להשוות הדעות, שגם לדידהו מעיקרא חובה לחזור, אלא שבלא חזר ובדיעבד, אכתי איכא תקנה אחריתי שאומרו אח״כ. וראה שו״ת שבט הקהתי ב, לז). ולאידך, בשאר האמירות ודאי לדעתם א״צ לחזור שיכול לסמוך שכיוון בראשונה. ובכדי שלא לאפושי פלוגתא כולי האי, איכא למימר שלכו״ע בשאר האמירות א״צ לחזור. ובאבודרהם נמי מוכח דלאו מילי סתראי נינהו, שמחד גיסא הביא בטעם האמירה ג״פ מפני שא״א שלא יכוון באחת משלשתן. ובחדא מחתא הביא בשם הגאונים שאם לא כיוון בפותח את ידיך צריך לחזור ולאומרו פעם אחרת. (אבל י״ל ולדחות, שכוונתו לחלק בין הכוונה בכל המזמור, שאא״פ שבא׳ מג׳ הפעמים לא יכוון. אבל בנוגע לפסוק פא״י אין לו לסמוך על שאר האמירות. והה״נ שיל״פ כן בד׳ שאר הראשונים. וממילא גם שלדידהו החובה לחזור עבור פסוק הנ״ל קאי רק בפסוד״ז). ובכל אופן, לדידן ולדינא, ודאי אין כל סרך הוכחה להכריחו לחזור.
ועכ״פ, אפשר ללמוד מדבריהם שלכתחילה עכ״פ עליו לכוון בכולהו. וכ״ה בר״י מלוניל ברכות שם, כל האומר תהל״ד ג״פ בכ״י ובלבד בכוונה. ובכלבו יב: כל האומר תהל״ד ג״פ בכוונה ביום וכו׳. ובמחז״ו א: ומיבעי איניש לכוונא דעתי׳ בתהל״ד דאר״א וכו׳ כל האומר תהל״ד ג״פ בכ״י. ובאמת גם בטור כ״כ. אלא שבטור הוסיפו המדפיסים תיבות ג״פ כנ״ל. ויל״ע אם גירסתם בגמ׳ ג״פ או שגם בזה הוסיפו המדפיסים.

וכיון שבימינו אין חוזרים בשביל  חסרון כוונה, ורק במקום המוכרח, אף שכאן המדובר בפסוק אחד בלבד, שבקל יוכל לכוון, כמ״ש הפוסקים בטעם שחוזרים בנדו״ד, מ״מ אין לנו להרחיק לכת לחייב לחזור גם בזה, כשכל עיקר אמירתו אינו בהכרח.  וראה גם לקו״ש שם ע׳ 355 הע׳ 35, שעיקר האמירה בפסוד״ז.
ובפרטיות יותר, דבפסוד״ז שאני דאיכא תלתא לטיבותא בטעם האמירה, מצד סידור שבחו של מקום קודם התפלה, ומצד יהא חלקי עם אומרי הלל בכ״י, ומצד אמירת תהלה לדוד ג״פ בכ״י (ראה רי״ף שם. טור או״ח נא. ב״ח שם. שו״ע אדה״ז שם א. אבל ראה פמ״ג בפתיחה לסי׳ מו. וי״ל). אבל באשרי ובלצ״ג איכא רק חד לטיבותא – אמירת תהלה לדוד ג״פ בכ״י, וכן במנחה – נמי רק חד לטיבותא, שהרי אין חיוב לסדר שבחו ש״מ  במנחה (זולת בג׳ ראשונות, ראה גם פמ״ג הנ״ל. וראה לקו״ש שם הע׳ 34), ועיקר טעם האמירה במנחה בכדי לשהות קודם התפלה ולעמוד מתוך ד״ת, כמ״ש הראשונים (ראבי״ה שם. או״ז ק. ועוד. וראה ט״ז קח, ג). אלא שתיקנו אמירת אשרי בדוקא משום מעלת אמירת תהל״ד ג״פ בכ״י – ראה רבינו מנוח ברכות ט, ד. מג״א נא, ז. (אבל ראה ערוה״ש רלד, א. ושו״מ שכ״ה בסי׳ ר״ש מגרמיזא. ומ״מ אכתי ה״ז רק תרתי לטיבותא, ולא משום אמירת הלל בכ״י). ונמצא שחלוקים המה ביסודם ושרשם. ואף דאכתי י״ל שכיון שסו״ס תיקנו במנחה ובאשרי ובלצ״ג לומר תהל״ד, ועיקר אמירתו משום פסוק זה, שוב הדרינן לדינא שצריך לחזור ולאומרו – אין לדמות האמירה כשהוא משום מנהג לעיקר האמירה בפסוד״ז, שהרי פסוד״ז חובה היא, ועיקר פסוד״ז הוא אמירת תהל״ד.
(וראוי להעיר שבכ״מ כתבו גם לחלק, שאמירת פא״י בפסוד״ז הוא דרך שבח, והשאר דרך בקשה, ונימוקם עמם ע״פ זח״ג רכו, א. ושם, שלא להתפלל על הפרנסה עד אחר התפלה. וכן ע״ד הקבלה חלוקים הם בכוונתם. וראה שעה״כ דרושי תפלת השחר יח, א. אבל להעיר שי״א עפ״ז שיותר חיוב תהלה לדוד אחר העמידה מבפסוד״ז – ראה יסוש״ה שער ה, שער הקרבן ט. ועוד. וכ״ה בתולעת יעקב סוד פסוד״ז. ושם, שבב׳ עונות אלו צריך לכוון. ומשמע יתר על כן, שבפסוד״ז א״צ כוונה כלל ועיקר. ובאמת אפשר להעמיס כן בזהר שם שהאמירה לאו בגין חובה. וראה לקוטי לוי״צ שם ב ע׳ תמד. ובהכרח ליישב בדוחק שכוונתו כוונה בדרך בקשה. וכפי שהוא בפי׳ ד׳ הזהר. ובכל אופן, כ״ז אינו ע״ד ההלכה. וראה בזה בלקו״ש שם הע׳ 35. ושם ס״ע 352 החילוק בענין אחר בין אמירתו ע״ד הנגלה לאמירתו ע״פ פנימיות התורה). ואין לנו הכרח לחדש שחובת החזרה קאי גם בשאר דוכתי.

ובקצוה״ש כו, ז כתב מד״ע שצריך לחזור ולאומרו גם במנחה. וכ״ה בעוד יוסף חי ויקהל ד. ולא העירו מכל הנ״ל. ואולי דעתם לחלק בין מנחה לאשרי שאחר העמידה, שסו״ס איכא נמי סידור שבחו קודם התפלה, אבל כנ״ל לא זהו טעם התקנה במנחה. ובכה״ח הנ״ל מחד גיסא, נראה דסגי בדיעבד בכוונה בחד מינייהו, דס״ל שבלא כיוון בפסוד״ז סגי לי׳ בשאר האמירות, ולאידך כתב להדיא שבשכח לכוון באשרי שאחר העמידה יחזור לאומרו הואיל ואין שם דין הפסק, ומשמע שלכתחילה צריך לחזור גם בזה. ולפ״ז נמצא שנהפכה הקערה על פי׳, שהכוונה בשאר האמירות חמירא טפי. והוא היפך פשטות ההלכה שעיקר האמירה בפסוד״ז חובה טפי, כנ״ל.
(והנה בחיי״א יח, ב, הביאו במשנ״ב נא, טז, שבנזכר אחר שכבר אמר מזמורים אחרים ואין שהות לחזור יאמר אחר התפלה. ומוכח דס״ל דלא ככה״ח הנ״ל דסגי בכוונה באשרי שאחר העמידה, גם בדיעבד, דהא מיירי כאן כשהוא כבר אחר התפלה (אא״כ ר״ל אחר תפלת העמידה לפני אשרי. ודוחק). ואף שיל״פ בדבריהם דה״ט לפי שהכוונה מעכבת בכולהו, ובכוונה באשרי שלאחר העמידה דיו שיפקיע א״ע – יותר נראה כנ״ל, דס״ל שהכוונה מעכבת דוקא בהאמירה שבפסוד״ז, ואמירה זו היא בשביל עצמה, ולא להשלמת פסוד״ז, ולא משום שגם באמירה זו כוונה מעכבת). והנאני שראיתי כדברינו גם בשו״ת גבעת שאול וואגשאל יט. וכ״כ בדעת יהודה שפירא נא – ע׳ כא. וראה גם קובץ העו״ב בשלח תשע״ו ע׳ 99. אבל ראה תשו׳ הגרח״ק בסו״ס אשי ישראל לה דמספק״ל בזה, וכדרכו. ואין ספיקו מוציא מידי ודאי דהנ״ל."

In regards to serving a Jew these type of beverages, there might be room for leniency depending on the circumstances. If however it involves pouring the client a ‘non kosher’ beverage on the spot for him to taste or drink, it may not be done.

I’m kind of new in the community and there are people who walk out of the room with their face to the Aron and back to the door. I had someone tell me it’s unnecessary. Do I need to stop this chumra? Or is this one of those things where I shouldn’t listen to people laughing about the situation?,"
You should not do so because even though walking past an ark doesn' t pose any halachic problem when done correctly; many Poskim have written that doing such causes disrespect for Chazal.</see>","
It is not halachically required but it’s appropriate to be stringent. This stringency only applies if your back is directly facing the Aron. It also only applies when leaving the shul, not when moving within the shul. If one wishes to be stringent even when moving around, it should only be done when directly in the line of the Aron and only within 4 Amos of it.

"I struggle with intrusive thoughts that are negative (to say the least) and become so anxious and worried about how they may affect people and reality-especially when wishing them something not good-when Chas veShalom I would never EVER want that. In general, what are the implications/bearing of the effects of our thoughts? To what extent does thought affect things? In the end of the day everything is up to Hashem no? On one hand we’re told to think good because this can affect the outcome of things and on the other hand we’re told to dismiss thoughts and have hesech hadaas.
While I would like to try to have hesech hadaas and ignore them, the problem is only intensified since I see there are times where that thing actually comes true and very close in timing. This has happened quite a few times. (I am currently working with a frum therapist and we’re not exactly sure how to approach this, as I would like the Emes of the Torah) I’m not sure what to believe and don’t want to live with anxiety of always trying to have positive thoughts/avoid negative ones or the fear of what harm they can cause.
I would appreciate clarification and certainty on how to view and deal with the ramification of our thoughts.
A tremendous thank you and besoros tovos always.","
Therefore it seems appropriate for us – if possible – מענין whether such thinking will come into being.</s> It should be noted however than even though some formulations exist within halachic literature regarding specific details relating specifically between various factors including time periods etc., these aren't necessarily applicable across all cases without careful analysis by professionals knowledgeable both mundane psychology issues along side their hashkafa understanding vis à Vis daf yomi shiurim from reliable sources who also possess profound expertise over many years concerning practical matters related especially but certainly more broadly speaking herein mentioned topics allied alongside proper professional guidance through experienced qualified mentors specializing directly via life experiences themselves having faced similar challenged circumstances while providing counsel accordingly based upon actual experience rather then just relying soleley merely theoretical frameworks alone which do indeed provide great insight yet require further qualifications before making any definitively conclusions thus rendering clear guidelines forthcoming given","
First and foremost it is most important that you abide by the guidelines your therapist is giving you. Indeed it is a mitzvah in the Torah to look after our health – mental and emotional health is included as well, if not even more important.
It is true that negative thoughts can cause negative effects. However, this only applies for one who chooses to have negative thoughts. If these thoughts come to you against your will, as you have stated clearly that these are things that you don’t want to happen, they are harmless and should simply be ignored.
Dwelling on the these thoughts does no good for anyone. Usually, a good idea during such times is to to focus to other important pursuits, whether Torah study or even mundane things lhavdil, which require your focus and attention. I trust that your therapist will be able to help you in these matters.
Everybody has their unique challenge which has been given to them from above, as a means to improve themselves. This is not something that should put us off. On the contrary, this indicates the great trust that Hashem has in this individual that he can succeed under the circumstances.  The greater the challenge, the greater the person’s neshoma is and this indicates that there are more kochos this person receives from on High to deal with it.
The Torah advice is to take things step-by-step, not allowing us to become anxious about the fact that we haven’t yet reached our goal. This is a lifelong mission to achieve our purpose in this world and it should be done b’simcha.
Wishing you all well, especially and being able to accomplish these goals in a healthy manner."

This question should be addressed to the certifying Hechsher, if there is one, or the agencies which produce lists of kosher Slurpee’s.
Of course, it’s always best to use Slurpee’s from a kosher certified location
From what I’ve read, but haven’t verified it myself:
99.9% of Slurpee flavors are kosher pareve. The Slurpee machine operates at 28°F, too cold for there to be any blios flavor. There are also no issues of kavush because of the high turnover of product. The flavors don’t usually sit in the machines for 24 hours. The compartment in the machine is so small that the Slurpee flavor is replaced after filling a few cups.
However, Slurpee is a registered trademark sold only at 7-Eleven stores. Other gas stations or convenience stores sell similar products but more caution is needed when purchasing from them. While 7-Eleven stores mostly use the main brands which are more likely to be kosher certified, other stores may use generic-brands that are not necessarily kosher certified. If the dispenser is shared among more than one flavor, and you cannot confirm that they are all kosher, it is recommended to run the machine until there is no residue of the previous flavor before filling your cup.

You mentioned that you are fairly certain that the body is Non-Jewish. Therefore, we will answer accordingly. However, it is important to note that some schools do in fact use Jewish cadavers (though not often). So, if possible, it may be a good idea to ask about the history of your cadaver. If not possible, you can work under the assumption that the body you are working on is in fact not Jewish (outside of Israel obviously).
In respect to your question, a non-Jewish cadaver donated to science for the purpose of medical education is okay to be studied on. This is because it is for the sake of medicine and the potential of finding cures for life threatening conditions.
That said, when you are in the anatomy lab working on a cadaver you should always keep in mind that the Tzelem Elokim applies to all humans and therefore work respectfully on the body. This includes not talking divrei chol, not joking around the body (as many students unfortunately do), and overall respect for the person who graciously donated their body for your education.
There are a number of organizations that may assist you with these challenges and others as you continue your medical career. One that comes to mind is an organization recently founded by frum medical students called the Jewish Physicians Network

"Are you not supposed to eat before a Bris and Pidyon Haben, like we don’t eat before doing any mitzvah like Tekios or Megilah?","
There is no specific prohibition against eating right after saying Shemoneh Esrei. There may be some customs that advise avoiding food for an hour prior but there isn't anything halachically wrong with it.</ref>","
Some write that the father may not eat before the Bris, just like one may not eat before any Mitzva that has a time limit, like Mincha, Maariv, and Bedikas Chometz.
However, there is reason to be lenient when the father appointed the Mohel to fulfill the Mitzvah for him.
Regardless, he may snack on non-mezonos foods and eat mezonos food up to a Kebeitza.
There is still a reason not to eat anything at all before the Bris as the Chassidim Harishonim would refrain from eating or drinking even the smallest quantities before performing a Mitzvah Chavivah such as Lulav, and certainly this would apply to Bris Milah. The custom however is to be lenient about this. Certainly one may be lenient about drinking.

ולכן, אם הניח עסק התפלה והלך לו לעסקיו שוב אינו משלים עוד. וכן גם אם הוא עדיין בבית הכנסת ושהה הרבה, כשעה או שתים, אינו משלים עוד. אבל אם ישב לאכול באמצע התפלה ושהה קצת, עדיין יכול להשלים.
אם מסופק אם שהה הרבה כגון ששהה שעה וחצי, אם הוא ביום חול, טוב שיתפלל תפלת התשלומין בתורת נדבה.

כתב הרשב”א (ברכות כו, א) דדוקא בזמן תפלה לפי שכיון שהוא זמן תפלה והוא עסוק בתפלתו, חוזר ומשלים מה שטעה בתפלתיו, אבל שלא בשעת תפלה לא, שאם לא כן, מאי מתפלל ערבית שתים ומתפלל מנחה שתים דקאמר לימא טעה ולא התפלל שחרית קודם חצות חוזר ומתפלל לאחר חצות, אי נמי טעה ולא התפלל מנחה חוזר ומשלימה כל הלילה הוה ליה למימר. עכ”ל. ונחלקו בהבנת דבריו, אם ר״ל שהוא דוקא בשעה שעוסק בתפלה ממש, או רק בזמן תפלה ולא כשעבר זמנה. ובראב״ד ספ״ג מהל׳ תפלה כתב: שכל אלו התשלומין שאמרו אינם אלא עם תפלה אחרת שבאה בזמנה הואיל ושעת תפלה היא. ומשמע דתרווייהו איתנהו. ובערך לחם למהריק״ש סי׳ קח דייק כן גם מל׳ הרמב״ם שם, ומקדים להתפלל תפלה שבזמנה ואחרי׳ מתפלל תשלומין״, דהול״ל רק ״ומקדים תפלה שבזמנה״, דכיון שכבר כתב שצריך להתפלל תשלומין בזמן תפלה הסמוכה ושמקדים התפלה שבזמנה, הרי בידוע הוא שאח״כ יתפלל תשלומין, אלא ודאי לאשמועינן שצריך שתהי׳ מיד אחרי׳, ולכן כתב ״אחרי׳״. והב״ד החיד״א במח״ב שם סק״ז, וקילסו שהוא דקדוק נאות.
וכתב התויו״ט בספרו דברי חמודות (ברכות פ”ד אות ה, הו”ד בא”ר סי’ קח סק”ד) שרצונו לומר שאם הניח עסק התפלה והלך לו שוב אין לו ענין להשלים. ובספרו מלבושי יו”ט סי’ קח ס”ג כתב שאם שהה הרבה אחרי שהתפלל כיון שאינו מתעסק בתפלה אין כאן זמן לתשלומין.
ובשיעור השהי’ – הנה בא״ר שם כתב שצ״ע בשיעור השהי׳. והביא מש״כ בפרישה שלא יאחר אלא שיעור הילוך ארבע אמות או אמירת אשרי ויתפלל מיד תפילת תשלומין. וכן בדברי חמודות שכתב ״שאם הניח עסק התפילה והלך לו אינו משלים״ – משמע דמיד שהניח עסק התפילה אינו משלים. אבל דעת אדה״ז סי׳ קח ס״ז שצ״ל שהה הרבה דוקא. ואינו סותר לדברי חמודות, דשאני התם שהניח עסק התפלה והלך לו. וא״ש שבציונים לשם צויין לד”ח הנ”ל, אף שלא מובא בס”ז בפירוש הדוגמא דהניח עסק התפלה התפלה והלך לו . ובפשטות, הוא לפי שכתב ״כגון ששהה הרבה״, והיינו שנקט דוגמא אחת שאינו בשעה שעוסק בתפלה – לפי ששהה הרבה, וה”ה – וכש״כ – אם הניח עסק התפלה והלך לו. וא״ש נמי דברי התויו״ט בספרו מלבושי יו״ט שבשהה הרבה אינו סותר למש״כ הוא עצמו בדברי חמודות שגם בהניח עסק התםלה אינו משלים. והדברים מוכרחים בענין זה גופא, ובהקדם התמיהה, שאם נאמר שדוקא “אם שהה הרבה” אינו יכול להשלים ה״ז לכאורה בסתירה להמשך הדברים שאפשר להשלים רק “בזמן שעוסק בתפלה”, שהרי כל שסיים תפלתו כבר אינו עוסק בתפלה, ומאי איכפת לן אם שהה רק קצת. ועל כרחנו לומר, דכמה גווני איכא שאינו עוסק בתפלה – שהניח עסק התפלה והלך לו, או שלא הניח תפלתו אלא ששהה הרבה, אבל אם לא הניח התפלה והלך ולא שהה רק קצת מיקרי עוסק בתפלה. וז״פ.
[ולהעיר שבמשנ״ב שם בסקט״ו הביא בדעה קמייתא דלא תיקנו תפלת השלמה רק בעודנו עוסק בתפילתו העיקרית אחר ששהה כדי הלוך ד”א או אשרי בינתיים. ומשמע מיני׳ שתפלת תשלומין צ״ל מיד ממש, וכל ששהה קצת יותר מזה אינו משלים. ובשעה״צ שם צייין למלבושי יום טוב ופרי חדש. אבל במלבושי יו״ט מפורש כנ״ל שהוא רק בשהה הרבה. וגם בפר״ח כתב בזה״ל ״בעודו עוסק בתפלתו העיקרית אחר ששהה כדי הילוך ד״א צריך להתפלל תפלת תשלומין, אבל אם הפסיק בין תפילה לתפילה והלך לעסקיו שוב אינו מתפלל, ומפורש שהוא רק כשהלך לעסקיו, ולא בשהה קצת.
וראה בכה״ח סקכ״א שהביא כל הדעות בדבר. אלא שבגדר עודנו עוסק בתפלה לא ישית בחלקות למו, והשוום אהדדי, אף דלאו כחדא איתני,  שיש שכתבו בהולך לעסקיו, או בשהה הרבה, ויש – שצ״ל מיד.
והנה בחקרי הלכות לשו״ע אדה״ז שם בח״ט (ובמהדו״ח – הוא במקומו) כתב שאדה״ז נסתפק בדין זה שאינו משלים רק כשעוסק בתפלה, כיון שהקיף ד״ז במוסגר. אבל צ״ע בדבריו, שלא הקיף רק תיבות ״הסמוכה לה״ בלבד, ושאר הענין – אינו במוסגר. ואדרבה, דין זה הביאו גם בס״א. אלא ששם הוא במוסגר. וראה גם בשו״ע אדה״ז ספ״ט ס״ב].
והנה, במלבושי יו״ט שם הביא מש״כ הלבוש שאם לא התפלל שחרית משלים אחר חצות קודם שהגיע זמן מנחה וכן אם לא התפלל מנחה ישלים בזמן תפילת ערבית ולא כל הלילה אחר כלות זמן תפילת ערבית. וכתב עלה, והרי שהה הרבה אחר שהתפלל ערבית, וכיון שאין מתעסק בתפילה אין כאן זמן לתשלומין. ועדיין לא נתברר כ״כ השיעור. וביוקח נא סק״ח בין הדברים חזר כמ״פ שאם שהה ״חצי שעה או חצי רביע״ שוב אינו יכול להתפלל תשלומין. וצ״ע הא מנ״ל. וסבור הייתי לומר, שכיון שצ״ל סמוך לתפלה שלפני׳, נקטינן חצי שעה כשיעור ״סמוך״ בכמה דוכתי. אבל כאן לא נזכר לישנא דסמוך (ראה כעי״ז באג״ק ח״כ ע׳ רפט), רק לגבי פרט זה שמשלים רק תפלה הסמוכה – היינו תפלה שלפני׳, ולא תפלה הקודמת יותר. אבל לגבי נדו״ד, עיקר הענין הוא שצ״ל ״בזמן תפלה״ ו״הוא עסוק בתפלתו״, ולא ״בשעה שאינה זמן תפלה״, ״ששהה הרבה״. וגם אילו הי׳ כאן הלשון ״סמוך״ – אי״ז לשון משנה וחז״ל, ואין מקום לדייק שהכוונה כשיעור סמוך בדוכתי אחריתי בחז״ל. וראה גם בקצוה״ש סכ״ח בבדה״ש סקי״א שלא נתברר כמה שיעור השהי׳ דשהה הרבה, וציין למש״כ שם בספרו ס״ח בבדה״ש סקס״ג (שהביא שם דברים הנראים כסותרים בדעת אדה״ז בשיעור הפסק, שלגבי תפלין  כתב ״ב׳ או ג׳ שעות״, ולגבי סוכה – ״שעה ושתים״).
אבל יש להביא קצת ראי’ מחי’ צ”צ עהש״ס ח״ב בהערות על קיצור פסקי הרא״ש ברכות פ״ג ס״ב – קצד, ג, שאפשר להשלים תפלת ערבית עד חצות ביום, והיינו כשנאנס מלהתפלל שחרית עד אותו זמן, או אפילו אם התפלל שחרית בזמנו, דהיינו קודם ד’ שעות, אלא שטעה בענין שצריך לחזור ולהתפלל פ”ב, אם הוא עדיין קודם חצות מתפלל שמ”ע לתשלומין דערבית ג”כ. ומשמע דבלא”ה אינו יכול להשלים. הרי לנו שהשהי’ בין זמן תפלה לחצות, דהיינו ב’ שעות זמניות בודאי נקרא שהה הרבה ואינו יכול להשלים עוד תפלת ערבית. וי”ל בדא״פ ע״פ מש”כ כ”ק אד”ש באג”ק ח”ג ע’ רי (בישוב דברי אדה״ז בשיעור ההפסק בתפלין וסוכה, ומוסיף שם שבטלית כתב ״כמה שעות״), ששיעור ההפסק בכל דבר הוא משך זמן הענין גופא, וכן מצינו הדין בתפלה וק”ש דצ”ל שהה כדי לקרוא את כולה (ראה שוע”ר ריש סימן סה). וה”ה בנדו”ד שהזמן של ״שהה הרבה״ – היינו ששהה כדי לגמור כל התפלה, וע”ד הרגיל היינו כשעה (ראה גם באג״ק שם). אבל כל עוד שלא שהה ב’ שעות עדיין בספק עומד (ראה קצוה״ש שם ס״ח), ובימי החול טוב שיתפלל תפלת התשלומין בתורת נדבה (ראה עד״ז בא”ר הנ”ל בסו”ד).
והנה במג”א סי’ קח סק”ג כתב שאסור לאכול קודם שיתפלל התשלומין ואם התחיל אינו פוסק. ובמחצית השקל סק”ג הקשה ממש״כ בשו”ע בס”ג דאינו משלים אלא בזמן התפלה. והביא מש״כ  בא״ר בשם הפרישה, שלא יאחר אלא שיעור הילוך ד’ אמות או אמירת אשרי ויתפלל מיד תפלת תשלומין, וא”כ כשעוסק בסעודה ואינו מפסיק אין ספק ששוהה יותר משיעור זה, ואיך ישלים אחר סעודתו. וכן בלחם חמודות שם כתב ממשמעות דברי הרשב”א, שאם הניח עסק התפלה והלך לו שוב אין לו ענין להשלים, וא”כ היכי שישב לאכל אחר תפלת שחרית, הרי סילק ידיו מענין תפלה, ואיך ישלים אחר גמר סעודתו. וכתב ליישב דברי מג״א, דאולי ס״ל למג”א דכל זה אינו אלא לכתחלה, אך לשון רשב”א שהביא בל”ח משמע דאפילו דיעבד, ע”ש. וכה״ק בס׳ החיים ס״ב, הביאו בדע״ת ס״ב. וכ”כ במאמ”ר סק״ב, להוכיח מכאן שגם כשאינו עוסק בתפלה יכול להשלים. (ואכן מה״ט הכריעו במחה״ש ובמגן גבורים שאפילו בדיעבד מפסיק, מחמת שצ״ל תפלת תשלומין סמוכה לתפלת חובה ומעכב בדיעבד, והביאם במשנ״ב סק״י. וכ״כ בס׳ החיים שם. אבל במגן גבורים גופא ס״ל שבדיעבד משלים גם לאחר זמן, ראה שם באלף המגן סק״ה, ועכ״ז ס״ל שמפסיק כיון שלכתחילה חייב להשלים מיד, והו״ל כהתחיל באיסור. וכעי״ז צ״ל בדעת המשנ״ב, דהא איהו גופי׳ ס״ל שם בסקט״ו שבדיעבד משלים גם אחרי ששהה, אלא שלכתחילה יותר נכון שאם לא התפלל תיכף יתפלל בתורת נדבה. אמנם, משמע שנקט כאן טעם אחר קצת שצריך להפסיק, ״משום שצריך להסמיך התפלה השני׳ לראשונה בכל מאי דאפשר״, והיינו אף שכבר עבר על חובת הסמכת התפלות לכתחילה, אכתי עליו להפסיק אכילתו בכדי להסמיכם כמה שאפשר). וראה גם בכה״ח סקכ״א.
והנה כ”ז אתי שפיר לדברי המג”א, שיל״פ בדעתו שחובת הסמכת התפלות היא רק לכתחילה. אך דא עקא דבשו״ע רבינו שם ס”ג כתב שאסור לאכול עד שיתפלל השניה ואם התחיל אין צריך להפסיק כדברי המג”א הנ”ל. ובס”ז שם כתב שאם שהה הרבה אחר שהתפלל תפלה שהיא חובת שעה אינו יכול להתפלל עוד לתשלומי תפלה שהפסיד ואפילו בדיעבד. (וראה גם בנתיב החיים על דה״ח סמ״ז שהביא ב׳ פרטים אלו בחדא מחתא להעיר על דרה״ח, שאם התחיל לאכול אינו מפסיק, ושאם שהה הרבה אינו משלים. ומוכח דלאו מילי סתראי נינהו). ועכצ”ל שבס”ג מיירי באכילה מעט באמצע התפלה בשהי’ מועטת, באופן שלא הניח עסק התפלה והלך לו וגם לא שהה הרבה, דאז נקרא שעדיין עוסק בתפלה."

האריכו בכ״מ בדיני לא תאמץ ולא תקפוץ. וראה גם לקמן. ועיקר השאלה כאן מצד אל ישוב דך נכלם – ראה רמ”א יו”ד סי’ רמט ס”ד.
אמנם, בגוף הענין מקום לפרש דלא קאי במחזר על הפתחים, אלא בסתם עני, אבל ברגיל לחזר על הפתחים נותנים לו רק מהקופה, וג״ז רק מתנה מועטת. ואין חובת יחיד ליתן לו. אבל בש״ך רנ, ד מפורש דלא כנ״ל. וראה גם בב״י שם ד״ה ומ״ש ולשון. וראה בסמ״ג עשין קסב, פי׳ כן בב״ב ט, א, שמתנה מועטת היא משום אל ישוב. וכ״ה ברדב״ז לרמב״ם מתנ״ע ז, ז. וכ״מ בירושלמי פאה ח, ה, שבמסבב על הפתחים מ״מ מחוייב שלא לפחות לו מארגרון, וי״מ דהיינו שלא לפחות מגרוגרת. וראה צפע״נ לרמב״ם שם. וראה שו״ת קשת יונתן יו״ד ה שהאריך.
והנה, ברמ״א הביא דין דאל ישוב בסתם עני ולא במחזר על הפתחים. וגם בקרית ספר לרמב״ם שם מובן דקאי בסתם עני. וצ״ע, דהא בלא״ה עובר משום לא תאמץ ולא תקפוץ. ופשוט שדין דאל ישוב אינו מה״ת, דלא קיימינן הכא מצד גדרי מצות צדקה כלל. ומשו״ה צ״ל דמיירי בעני שמחזר על הפתחים שישלימו לו הרבים (וראה גם אמ״ב או״ח יג, ג בסופו, דליכא לא תקפוץ במחזר על הפתחים. אבל ראה העמק דבר ראה טו, ז איפכא). ובספרי ראה קטז, ובכ״מ – הי׳ מחזר על הפתחים אי אתה זקוק לו לכל דבר. והיינו מצד גוף המצוה. וכאן – הוא מצד אל ישוב. וראה בירושלמי פאה שם). ולרמ״א – צ״ל דקאי בשאר אנפי שפטור ממצות צדקה מצ״ע , כגון שנתן כבר כשיעור (ולהעיר מכעי״ז בפי׳ רבינו יונה משלי כא, יג). (גם י״ל שהעני קיבל כבר מהקופה,  וכבר נתמלא חסרונו והוא בגדר דלעשרו – ראה רשב״א שבועות כה, א. מאירי ב״ב י, ב. אלא שלא מסתבר לאוקמי בהכי, שהרי בכגון דא אינו  בגדר ״דך״). ובכגון דא, הוא רק מדרבנן (או אפי׳ מדברי קבלה. אבל מסתבר יותר דהרמב״ם אסמכה אקרא דדברי קבלה), והוא בכדי שלא יתבייש העני.
ומוכח הוא במקורו ברמב״ם, שהלאוין והעשין לא נזכרו כאן כלל בענין זה, כנ״ל. (וכבר תמהו בזה, דהא בלא״ה חייב מצד הלאוין. ולהנ״ל א״ש, דקאי באופן שמצד מצות צדקה פטור. ויש שפי׳ שיש עניים מרובים, וקמ״ל שחייב ליתן לכולם ולא רק לאחד. ודוחק קצת. וראה לקמן באופן שכבר נתן מעשר או חומש). וכן מוכח מזה שהשיעור כאן בגרוגרות שהוא פחות משו״פ (וראה דרך אמונה שם בביה״ל רפ״ז ע״פ ספרי ס״פ תצא, וראה כתובות עט, ב, שי״ב ומחצה גרוגרות נמכרים בפרוטה. וראה גם שו״ת שבה״ל ה, קלד, ג – לס״ד. והארכנו בהלכה יומית תקסג, וכאן בקיום מצות צדקה בפחות משו״פ).
ונראה, שכ”ז הוא רק אם שאל העני אצלו בפרטיות (כדברי המחבר שם). אבל אם עומד ליד פתח ביהכ”נ, אין לו בושה במה שאינו נותן לו. ובפרטיות, שגם לגבי לאו דלא תאמץ ולא תקפוץ וכן בעשה דפתוח תפתח, חקרוה אם מיירי דוקא בתובעו,  או אפי׳ בראהו (כל׳ הרמב״ם מתנ״ע  ז, ב, ובר״י קורקוס שם. וראה צפע”נ שם. ובחינוך מ׳ תעט: בעת שנשאל או שראה שצריך הדבר.  וברשב״א שבועות שם: דוקא כשעני שואל ממנו. וראה ראשון לציון יו״ד רמז, א. מחנ״א צדקה א. שו״ת קול אליהו ב יו״ד יט. מחנה חיים א, צב ד״ה והרמב״ם, יהודה יעלה  א יו״ד קיח, ערוה״ב יו״ד ריט. אפרקסתא דעניא יו״ד ג, קפא. גבורת אליהו קט. דרך אמונה מתנ״ע ז, ז ובציון ההלכה שם טו. שו״ת שבה״ל ד, קכז. שם ה, קלא – לסרמ״ז ס״א. שם ט, קצט). אמנם, בלאו דאל ישוב פשוט שהוא רק במבקש ושואל, כל׳ הרמב״ם. וכ״ה באפרקסתא דעניא שם. וכ”ה בנדו״ד בשו”ת תשובות והנהגות ח”ה סי’ רפח. וראה גם עד״ז בס׳ אהבת צדקה אבידן, בפסקי הגרצ״פ פראנק, ע׳ טז, בשמו, ונדפס גם בהר צבי רשמי שאלה יו״ד הלכות צדקה ע׳ קנה, שבעני המסתובב בין הבחורים בביהמ״ד אין לחשוש לדך נכלם, כיון שהעני לא בא אליו במיוחד, אלא שרוצה לקבל בישיבה זאת סכום כסף. ועוד שם ע׳ קנו, שאפילו אין בחורים נוספים שם, אם העני אינו מכיר אותו, אי״ז בגדר דך נכלם. וכעי״ז בשלמי שמחה ח״א צדקה ומעשר כספים פ״א  סי״ט (ע’ נג) הע’ 23, בשם הגרשז״א, שכאשר העני יודע מראש שסיכוייו לקבל צדקה קלושים, כמו בעובר מדירה לדירה או בנכנס לישיבה או לביהכ״נ אינו דך נכלם. אבל ראה פלא יועץ ערך צדקה שבכלל זה הוא “עני שפושט מטפחת בפתח בית הכנסת שהוא כמי ששואל לכל אחד, וצריך כל אחד להטיל לו פרוטה”. וי”ל דהתם איירי באופן שהעני עומד שם, וכל אחד ואחד הי׳ עובר דרכו, ובצורה שהי׳ מתבייש אם לא היו נותנים לו, שהכל תלוי בהבושה שמרגיש העני.
ובכ״מ מצינו שהאיסור דאל ישוב דך נכלם הוא רק במבקש לעצמו, ולא לגבאי צדקה – דרך אמונה מתנ״ע ז, מח. שלמי שמחה ע׳ נד בשם הגרשז״א. והיינו גם למ״ד דשאר לאוין שייכי גם בגבאי צדקה. וראה הלכה יומית אות סד. ועוד איכא בגווה שהוא רק לצדקת עניים ולא בהחזקת ת״ת ושאר צרכי מצוה.
והנה, בעני המבקש כמ״פ, אף שנתן תתן הוא אפי׳ מאה פעמים, ספרי ויל״ש עה״פ ראה טו, יו״ד, והובא בפירש״י שם – מסתבר שאינו חייב בכך שוב, ומכמה טעמים: חדא שבש״ס ב״מ לא, ב דריש באו״א (אלא שי״ל שב׳ הדרשות ששקולין הם ויבואו כאחד, כמ״ש עד״ז בסמ״ג עשין יא, לגבי הוכח תוכיח. וראה שו״ת הרב״ז ג, טז). ועוד, שלכמה דעות קאי דר.ה זו במצות הלואה ולא במצות צדקה, ראה יראים קסז. סמ״ג עשין קסב. וברמב״ם ושו״ע לא הובא לדינא. וראה בעמק הנצי״ב לספרי, וכן במלבי״ם, דמפרשי לה לברכה ולא למצוה. והעיקר, שכ״ז בעני אחר ולא באותו עני, וכדמוכח באדר״נ ג, ז. וראה ביפ״ת השלם, לב״ר סא, ג, ד״ה בשחרית, שכתב דמיירי בשני עניים, אלא שמצוצמם במעותיו וקמ״ל שידחוק עצמו.  ועוד כתב באו״א, דמיירי בחד עניא, ומחזיר על הפתחים, ויתנו לו אחרים, שמ״מ טוב ליתן לו שנית. והזכיר במדרש שחרית וערבית לפי שהם זמני הסעודה, יעו״ש באורלך. וממוצא דבריו אתה למד, שאין חובה מן הדין ליתן לאותו עני.
אמנם, ראה נחלת יעקב לפירש״י ראה טו, יא, שגם באותו עני חייב מאה פעמים. וכ״ה בסה״ש תנש״א א ע׳ 195. שו״ת שבה״ל ה שם בתחילתו סק״ג. וראה בסו״ס שער התפלה לבעל באמ״ח ותולדותיו – מהדורת ירושלים תשכ״ט – ע׳ 298. ועד״ז מסופר בכ״מ. ומ״מ, פשוט דהיינו רק משום מצות צדקה ומשום די מחסורו. אבל במחזר על הפתחים שפטור משום די מחסורו, ואינו מצד מצות צדקה, רק מדינא דאל ישוב, יכול להסתפק בזה שאומר לו שכבר נתן בכדי שלא יתבייש. וגם משום מצות צדקה גופא – מסתבר שכל שלא נתחדש חיוב חדש אין חובה שוב.
אבל בכ״מ העירו מירושלמי פאה י, ה דמשמע שיתן לאותו עני עוד פעם אלא שהלוקח יחוש לעצמו. אמנם התם קאי במעשר עני שכבר הפריש. וגם אינו מוכרח שחייב בזה, ורק היתרא הוא. ועוד, שעד כאן לא שמענו אלא לגבי גוף מצות צדקה, אבל מסתבר דליכא משום דך נכלם (אף ששמעתי באומרים לי, דרווחא שמעתתא שהחידוש דאל ישוב שהוא באופן שכבר נפטר ממצות צדקה כיון שכבר נתן לעני פ״א. ולא מצאנו מקור לסברא זו). ובפרט, שאילו ידע שכבר נתן לא הי׳ מבקש מעיקרא. (וראה בכ״ז שו״ת שבט הקהתי א, רנה. רבבות אפרים ד, רז, ט. חיי הלוי ד, סז. באורח צדקה ו, לג ע’ צז. שם ע׳ שפז. תלד. חשוקי חמד ע״ז יז, ב.  דרך שיחה ע׳ תקס. שאלת רב א ע׳ נג. ב ע׳ פז. שערי ציון בשם הגרח״ק ב ע׳ רצה. מעשה איש ד, קלח).
ועוד דנו בה משום הרמאים, שבד״כ אינם מקבצים למזון רק לכסות. וגם למוין – היינו רק במבקש אוכל למו, ולא במעות לאוכל. אלא שמ״מ עליו לבדוק משום ספיקא דאורייתא. וראה גם במאירי כתובות סח, א שלא יהא פוטר עצמו במחשבה זו עד שידע הדבר בבירור. ובפנ״י כתובות שם שבגמ׳ קאי רק ע״ז שאין נותנים די מחסורו ולא לפוטרו לגמרי משום רמאין. אלא שאינו כפי פשטות הגמרא. ויש שכתבו לפרש בגמ׳, שמחזיקים טובה לרמאין רק מצד שלא יקרא עליך אל ה׳ והי׳ בך חטא, ולא קאי בחובת צדקה. ועכ״פ, לא מצינו שצריך ליתן לכל פושט יד רק בפורים. ויש לחלק. וראה שו״ת משנ״ה יג, קעג. שם טז, סט – שהחמיר. ונראה, שמ״מ אינו עובר מחמת הספק, ראה גם חמדת ישראל בקונטרס נר מצוה סד, דבספק ליכא לאו כלל, ואיהו קאי גם לגבי לא תאמץ ולא תקפוץ. (ויש חולקים. וראה בזה קובץ עץ חיים באבוב כז ע׳ קנב).
ומ״מ, לגבי אל ישוב, כיון שאינו דאורייתא, פשוט דליכא לחייבו מספק (ולא מסתבר לומר שדינו כספק דברי קבלה למחמירים בספיקו. ובפרט דלאידך איכא סברא שמכשילו בגזל – ראה צדקה ומשפט ב, נז בשם הגרשז״א, ואפילו אם נותן לו במתנה גמורה ולא מדין צדקה, מדין נתכוון לאכול בשר טלה ועלה בידו חזיר, שגם בזה איכא לפנ״ע (ראה תוס׳ קדושין לב, א ד״ה דמחיל). ועוד, שי״א שגם ספק צדקה לקולא, ראה ר״ן נדרים ז, א). ולדברינו שפיר מובן מש״א להחזיק טובה לרמאין, דקאי עלה רק מצד הא דאל ישוב. וכיון שכבר קיים חיובו, שנתן מעשר, או שהעני משלים מחסורו במק״א,  או שנותן מה שנתחייב לעני אחר, או בעני שאינו נצרך לאלתר דליכא משום צדקה והוא בכלל לעשרו, פטור מדין דאל ישוב במקום ספק רמאי. וכש״כ בדאיכא תרתי לריעותא, כגון שגם מחזר על הפתחים וגם אינו נצרך לאלתר שאין לחייבו במקום ספק רמאי. (ותו, שיש מקום לומר, דמעיקרא ליכא דין דאל ישוב בתרתי לריעותא).
ובימינו אלה הרבה פעמים אינם מבקשים אפי׳ עבור כסות. וראה נחלת יעקב להחוו״ד ראה טו, ז, לגבי לא תאמץ ולא תקפוץ דקאי רק ברואה רעב וערום. ואף שעיקר דבריו לחומרא, משמע מינה גם לקולא. וראה גם קובץ הנ״ל ע׳ קנא. ובכמה מהם יש לחוש עוד, שקונה דברים אסורים וסמים. וראה באורח צדקה ע׳ שנד אות לט, בשם בעל שבה״ל, שכשאוספים צדקה כל היום, מסתבר שאין עוברים בלא תאמץ ולא תקפוץ, לפי שבד״כ יש להם לאכול לזמן רב והרבה מוחזקים לעשירים.
והאידנא דשכיחי רמאין, וי״א דאיכא רוב רמאין, קיל טפי. וראה קובץ תשובות ד, צא.
ועוד זאת, שהרבה פעמים מתביישים כשמקבלים פרוטה או פחות, וכש״כ בגרוגרות. ולפי פשוטו, ליכא משום דך נכלם, דהרי מתבייש יותר כשנותנים. ואדרבה לכאורה אסור ליתן. ולא מסתבר לחייבו משו״ה שיתן עוד. וראה באורח צדקה ע׳ שס אות ע, בשם בעל שבה״ל. וראה כל משאלותיך ע׳ תקסט בשם הגרח״ק שבמתבייש ליקח פרוטה סימן שאינו עני.
גם לפעמים מקום להתיר משום עוסק במצוה – ראה הלכה יומית אות ב. ואולי כ״ה גם בממהר לתפלה. ואכ״מ. וראה הלכה יומית רסז.
ויש להסתפק, בנותן כבר מעשר אם עובר באל ישוב, ובהקדם, שבראשון לציון ריש סי׳ רמז נסתפק לגבי לא תאמץ. (וראה שו״ת אג״מ אה״ע ג, מג ד״ה אבל. חוט שני שבת ב ע׳ של). אבל בשבילי דוד רמט, ד לגבי אל ישוב, שחייב גם כשנותן מעשר. ומ״מ מי שנותן חומש, ולא רק מעשר, מסתבר שאינו חייב שהרי כבר נתן כל חובתו – ראה פיה״מ פאה א, א שהתשפותו בממונו יש לו גבול הוא חמישית ממונו, ואינו חייב לתת יותר, ואין עליו חטא בהמנעו מהשלים כל מה שהם צריכים כיון שהוא יותר מהחומש. וכן נפסק לדינא בשו״ע יו״ד רמט, א. (אלא שבקיימי עניים, או בידו משגת, י״א שחייב יותר. וראה לקו״ש כז ע׳ 218. לח ע׳ 112 ואילך). וילע״ע. וראה שו״ת חיי  הלוי ד, ז, לחייב משום אל ישוב גם בנותן בחומש. ואת״ל הכי, י״ל שמשו״ה לא הזכיר ברמב״ם בהשבת פניו ריקם רק משום אל ישוב, ולא שאר הלאוין, דקאי במי שכבר נתן חומש. ודוחק.
ולהעיר מהמסופר בתולדות יעקב קנייבסקי ע׳ ע בשם האחיעזר כשיש ריבוי עניים ואא״פ ליתן לכולם, ואין דנים אא״פ מאפשר. והובא גם באורח צדקה ע׳ שפח.
כן דנו אם חייב ללוות או לחזור לביתו להביא כסף או לפרוט כסף גדול.

נשאלתי מאברך שמתפלל בשבת בבוקר עם ציבור עמך ויש בהם מחללי שבת שבאים עם רכב לבית הכנסת. ומוכרים את העליות וגם המחללי שבת קונים עליות ועולים לתורה. ונמצא שאין שבעה קרואים כיון שחלק הם מחללי שבת. האם יוצא ידי חובת קריאת התורה?,"
Yes.</s>","ובקצרה: מה הדין בדיעבד אם לא היה שבעה קרואים אלא היה רק חמשה עולים בשבת האם בדיעבד יצאו ידי חובת קריאת התורה?
מענה:
הגדרת ״אם יצאו חובת קריאת התורה״ לא פשוטה. ויש כמה פנים לשאלה זו – אם חייבים לשמוע עוד פעם קריאת התורה, אם מותר להצטרף למנין, ואם מותר לעלות שם. והתשובה – לאו דוקא אחידה. והשאלה האחרונה – הכי חמורה. ולמעשה, מקום להתיר לעלות שם, בהתאם לתנאי המקום, כשאין חשש נתינת יד וחיזוק לעוברי עבירה ח״ו, שבזה הוא מהדברים שהכל תלוי לפי מה שהוא אדם והמקום והזמן והאישים. וק״ל.
הנה, בגופו של ענין, לא ברירא מילתא כלל שאסור להעלותם לתורה, מכמה טעמים. והאריכו בזה טובא. וכדלקמן.
וגם את״ל שאסור להעלותם, עדיין מותר לו לעלות בעלי׳ אחרת, כפי שכתבנו במק״א בנוגע לעלות במקום שהקורא קורא בטעויות, שאף גם במקרה שכל הקריאה שעד עתה לא היתה כדת, אם יקרא עתה ג׳ פסוקים כדבעי, יכול לברך רק בשביל עלייתו לחוד (ולא רק בכדי שלא לבטל הקריאה, כ״א גם לדעות שאין לקרוא כה״ג בברכה), חדא שאפשר לברך רק בשביל זה גופא, שקורא ג׳ פסוקים כדבעי. ועוד, דחזי לאצטרופי דעת המאירי ברכות יא, א, שיש לברך בכל פעם שקורא בתורה גם כשאינה מתקנת עזרא. וכ״פ בשו״ת גנת ורדים א, מט. וראה שו״ת תורת רפאל ב. וראה הנסמן בשו״ת יחו״ד א, עט. וגם הצ״צ צירף סברא כזו בשו״ת או״ח קי, לענין קריאה בת״צ במקום שאין עשרה מתענים.  (ובנוגע לתעניות, גם כשאין שבעה מתענים – כבר פסקו כך רעק״א וחת״ס. ואכ״מ). ועיי״ש בשו״ת הצ״צ עוד סברא שכשצריך לקרוא מספק, חייב לברך מה״ט גופא. והה״נ בעניננו שמחמת הספק במחלוקת הפוסקים בנוגע לעלי׳ למחללי שבת, אם מותר לקרוא להם לתורה, חייב לקרוא בתורה, וממילא מה״ט גופא מברך. וראה גם בשו״ת הצ״צ או״ח ג בארוכה בכל עיקר דין סב״ל. (אבל אין לומר מחמת ספק חיוב דאורייתא דברכה״ת, שקריאה זו אינה מה״ת והוא רק שלא לבטל הקריאה (כ״כ בלבוש), אא״כ נאמר שיש בזה גם משום חובת קריאה מצ״ע. וגם פשוט שחובת ברכה״ת אינה לכל עולה, שרק הפותח והחותם מברך מדין המשנה). גם הרי נהגו לברך גם בכה״ג, ול״ש סב״ל במקום מנהג, ראה גם בצ״צ שם. (אבל ראה בשו״ת צ״צ או״ח לה בנוגע לברכה שא״צ כשמוסיפים עליות. ואכ״מ).
ולהעיר גם משקו”ט בנוגע לעלי׳ בקריה״ת בליל שמח״ת, וכן בכיו”ב, אם מותר לעלות ולברך במקום שלא נהגו משום ברכה לבטלה, ויש שהביאו ראי’ ממנהג להוסיף קריה”ת לחתן בפ’ ואברהם זקן, שלא חשו משום ברכה לבטלה. ויש לחלק. ואף שלכתחילה אין לעשות מעשה להוציא ס”ת ולברך “בכל עת שיסכימו עשרה מישראל” (כדעת המקילים, והוא ע״פ מאירי ברכות יא, א) מקום לומר שבמקום מנהג (ראה מאמ״ר תקסו, ה לענין קריה״ת ביום שנעשה נס), וכשכבר קראו לו לעלות, ואיכא משום כבוד התורה וכבוד הבריות שאני. ובכ״מ צירפו ד״ז לבית הספק. וראה ברכות המים קלה, שסמך ידו על הגוו״ר והצילו מהאחרונים החולקים. וראה גם שו״ת מהרש״ג ב, צב בהערה. הגהות פעולת שכיר על מעשה רב רלא. פני מבין או״ח ל, א. ובבא״ח תצוה הל׳ פורים יד בנוגע לקריה״ת בבגדאד ביום ט״ו באדר. והוא רק בגדר צירוף. ועוד, דהכא איכא עוד כמה ספיקי טובא.
ובכלל, בנוגע למחללי שבת – יצויין, שבשו״ת חכ״צ כתב בטעמא דמילתא שאין לך חילול השם וכיבוי מאור הדת גדול מזה, משא״כ בתינוקות שנשבו שבימינו שבאים להתפלל מחמת שרוצים להתקרב ליהדות. וכ״כ בתורת חיים סופר א, נה, ח ד״ה עוד כשבא לומר קדיש וכו׳. ואכן כ״פ בשו״ת אג״מ או״ח ג, יב שברכתו ברכה אבל יש למעט בזה כפי האפשר. ושם, שבימים נוראים יותר יש לקוראם לתורה. (וראה שם כב. שם ב, נא. וכבר העירו שסותר למש״כ שם או״ח ד, צא, ח). וכ״כ בארחות רבינו מהדו״ח ע׳ רל בשם החזו״א שבבא להתפלל היינו שיש לו זיקה ורגש. וראה גם פאר הדור ג ע׳ לו בהערה. ובשו״ת בית דוד לייטר קו, טז העיד שכן עשה מעשה הרה״ק הר״א מראטען. וכן ראו אצל הרה״ק הר״י מבעלזא, עיי״ש. וראה צאנז גליון רצ בשם בעל דברי יציב בהנהגתו בנסיעתו באני׳, ושהסכים עמו הרה״ק הר״א מבעלזא.
וראה גם ס׳ החיים פלאגי יא, ג. זקן אהרן א, יג. אורח נאמן קמג. צור יעקב ק. אהל משה צוויג מהד״ת ג. שרידי אש ב, קנו.  מנח״י ד, י. חלקת יעקב א, צא (או״ח כז). יחו״ד ב, טז. חזו״ע ב ע׳ רלט.
ובשו״ת לב אברהם א, יח שכל ערום יעשה בדעת.
וכש״כ שיש מקום להקל במקום חשש איבה, וכן במתבייש בפני אדם גדול.
ובשו״ת מנח״ש ב ד, י דייק בלשונו, שרצוי לא להעלותם. וראה שם עוד.
וראה אג״ק יד ע׳ צה שתלוי בכו״כ פרטים הן בנוגע לאופן של זה הרוצה לעלות, והן בנוגע להנמצאים בביהכ״נ והרושם עליהם.
וגם המחמירים לא הזכירו שלא יצא ידי חובה אלא האם מותר לו לעלות מעיקרא או לא. אבל לא מצאנו מי שאומר שלא יצא ידי חובת קריאת התורה.
ובכתבי הרב הענקין תשובות איברא, ב ע׳ יא כתב כדברינו להקל מחמת שהעיקר הבעל קורא, ושראוי שהראשון והאחרון יהיו כשרים וראויים לברכה.
ושוב העירוני משו״ת אול״צ ב, ט, ה – ע׳ פה – דאף דס״ל שאינו מצטרף לעשרה ושאין להעלותו, היקל במקום חשש איבה וקטטה, כיון שיש אפשרות להשלים מנין שבעה ע”י החזן הקורא בתורה. ואע״פ שהחזן קרא בלא ברכות התורה, הרי לענין מנין שבעה לא צריך ברכות התורה, שמעיקר הדין לא היו העולים לתורה מברכים ברכות התורה אלא הראשון והאחרון בלבד, וכיון שיש לסמוך על החזן להשלים למנין שבעה, לא יתקוטטו עמו שלא להעלותו, ודרכיה דרכי נועם כתיב. והוסיף, שיכולים לענות אמן על ברכות התורה של המחלל שבת, שהרי אין ברכותיו ברכות לבטלה, שהרי ישראל הוא, אלא שאינו עולה למנין שבעה. והיכא דאפשר כתב שיוסיפו עוד עליה לתורה, ובזה יהיו שבעה עולים עם ברכות התורה ללא כל חשש."

" Do wine bottles need to have the Hechsher printed on the cork?
I recently started importing wines with a very good hashgacho and almost all the bottles have the hechsher printed on the cork, but some of the bottles do not. I Inquired with the manufacturer, and they told me that due to supply chain and time constraints the hashgocho allowed them to use corks without the hechsher printed on them. In my daas baal habatim, this doesn’t sound right. It sounds like delivering food without a seal or something. Please let me know what the Rov thinks about his situation. Thank you.","
If it was done under proper supervision there is no problem in drink from such containers even if their name does appear at first glance as being non-kosher.</see>","
If the corks are fastened in the wine bottles in a way that if opened by someone it would be very hard or impossible to put it back to look as it was (as in most cases with wine bottles), then it would be considered a seal even if there is no Hashgacha printed on it.
Even if not, there is a debate amongst the poskim if wine nowadays needs two seals (like it says in Shulchan Aruch) or one seal would be enough.
Thus, if the wine is Mevushal then the cork is sufficient according to all. If it is not Mevushal, then according to some opinions there should be a second seal, for example (like a lot of wines have) a piece of plastic that covers the cap/cork and top of bottle tight in a way that once opened it can’t be returned.
(Even even if it only has a cork, if the company’s name is printed on it, one may rely on the lenient poskim when the company only produces kosher wine. However, a company that produces non-kosher wine but also has a kosher run, would need to have the actual hashgocho printed on it.)
In any case, after the fact one may rely on the lenient poskim who hold that one seal is sufficient."

(This year, since it’s Erev Shabbos, one should make sure to begin such meal before the 10th Halachic hour of the day).
In some places, however, the Rebbe cites the Minhag also in regards to the night of the 15th (the time when the Korban was eaten in the times of the Beis Hamikdash).
It’s recorded in some places that the Rebbe ate the Matzah on the day of the 14th or – sometimes and – on the night of the 15th. (There were a few exceptions, such as when Pesach Sheini would be on a Taanis Behab, or when the Rebbe went to the Ohel).
[To note also that it’s recorded that on Pesach Sheini 5712 – a Friday, and the day after the passing of the Rebbe’s brother, R. Yisroel Aryeh Leib – the Rebbe washed for a meal and ate from the Matzah that was baked on Erev Pesach (even though generally the Rebbe would not wash for a meal on Erev Shabbos).]
Additionally, in the Sicha of Shabbos Parahas Shmini 5740 (not Muga), it’s recorded that the Rebbe mentioned the different customs on this (such as eating on the night/day/afternoon of the 14th), and stated that those who wish to be Mehader (scrupulous) eat on all these 3 occasions, as well as on the days before and after Pesach Sheini. The implication however is that this was not mentioned as a practical directive."

After finishing reciting Shemoneh Esreh, it is important to take three steps back, just as one would when leaving the presence of a king, and then say farewell. Neglecting to do this is the same as not reciting Shemoneh Esreh at all.
It’s important not to incline your head while stepping back; instead, bow first and take the three steps in one bow. While still bowed, bid farewell to your left and right before straightening up.
You should begin by inclining your head to the left, which is to the right of the Shchina that is before you as you leave your place of prayer. Then, incline your head to the right, which is to the left of the Divine Presence.
This means that when you say “Oseh shalom bimromav,” you should incline your head to the left, and when you say “Hu yaaseh shalom aleinu,” you should incline your head to the right. This is how it is brought in Shulchan Aruch.
In Sefer Haminhagim, however, the order is as follows: When you say “Oseh shalom bimromav,” you should incline your head to the left, when you say “Hu” hold your head in the center, when you say “Hu yaaseh shalom aleinu,” you should incline your head to the right, and when you say “Val . . amen” hold your head in the center.
The Rebbe would do as follows: “Oseh” to the left, “Shalom” to the right, “bimromav” in the center, lift his head and say “Hu . . amen”.
The lefty would bow in the same order.
See here as well:
What is the correct way to take the three steps at the end of Shmone Esrei?
A lefty would take the first step back with their right foot.
After you take the three steps back, you should stay there until Kedusha. If you are not Davening with the Minyan, you should stay there for the above amount of time."

If there is no possibility of having children then it would be permitted for them. However this only applies if they have tried other means such that we assume their fertility has been checked out by medical professionals.</span>","
The distinction is rooted in the traditional understanding of the purpose of sexual relations within marriage. According to Torah, procreation is considered one of the primary purposes of sexual intimacy. While a heterosexual couple unable to conceive naturally can still engage in sexual relations to strengthen their bond, they are seen as engaging in an act with the potential for procreation, even if it does not result in pregnancy. (This also explains why even for a heterosexual couple there are still laws that prohibit certain types of sexual intimacy).
Additionally, every time there is relations within marriage it creates Neshamos above and brings sanctity into this world. Indeed, we are taught that the souls of converts emanate from such relations. Likewise, these souls will eventually descend into bodies in the days of Moshiach. This can be compared to planting, where the harvesting takes place later, in higher worlds or even down here below.
In the case of a same-gender couple, their sexual relations are considered as deviating from the natural design for procreation. Indeed, sexual acts outside the context of heterosexual marriage are associated with transgressions. This can be compared to spilling seed without any planting whatsoever.
It is also important to note that Jewish teachings emphasize the complementarity of male and female in the context of marriage. This perspective highlights the belief that the coming together of male and female is seen as a necessary element in fulfilling the divine purpose of creation and the continuation of the human family, as well as causing the unity of masculine and feminine forces in the universe."

" Is an oven with Sabbath Mode permitted on Yom Tov for cooking?
Hi,
My electric oven has an “Adjusting the Temperature” part of the Shabbos Mode, where you can push buttons to change the temperature.
“1. Press Bake, use the 1 through 5 number pads and the Timer pad to select a different preset cooking temperature, and press Start.
2. Since no feedback is given during temperature change, an oven thermometer can be used to confirm temperature changes.”
Is it permitted on Yom Tov for cooking?
The use case would be to have the oven on 200 at the start of Yom Tov to keep food warm, but then the next day, to change the temperature to 350 to allow for proper cooking.
I saw on the Star-K website that it’s okay. I wanted to know if this is fine lichatcila.
“Some Sabbath Mode ovens are designed to work on a delay when in Sabbath Mode, the display will not change. In addition, this feature permits raising the temperature on Yom Tov at any time, regardless of when power is flowing to the oven. This is because when one adjusts the dial or keypad, it is not directly causing the temperature of the oven to change. Therefore, this action is considered a grama, an indirect action, which will cause the temperature to be raised. Even with these types of ovens, it is better to lower the temperature only when necessary for food preparation or enjoyment of the Yom Tov. (Other features of Sabbath mode ovens are discussed further in this article.)”

First, a general note of caution that some appliance manufacturers have been known to design “Shabbos Mode” models according to their own understanding of the requirements, which can be deficient. Therefore, the “Adjusting the Temperature” feature you describe may not actually involve the timed delay described in your quote from the Star-K advice, in which case it would not be allowed even according to the Star-K position. As such, further investigation would be necessary to establish how the oven works.
However, the main issue here is that the Star-K advice is based on a lenient view that:
1.       An action of Grama (indirect), even if intended and desired, is permissible with regards to Havarah (igniting) and Kibui (extinguishing) on Yom Tov.
2.       That a delay of 15-25 seconds (or more) is considered grama even though it is bound to result from the internal computer process triggered by pressing the button.
Many Poskim reject this permissive approach for many reasons. Notably, for those who follow the rulings of the Alter Rebbe, an act of Grama is not routinely permitted on Yom Tov, and one should therefore not rely on this leniency."

There are several issues here:
The requirement of taking lulav. They need to close their fingers or even better lift it. At the very least, according to some opinions, holding it in such a way that it doesn’t fall is also considered taking.
The fact that two people are holding it together: If they hold in such a way that without your support it would not fall and you are just assisting, and reversely, without them holding it, it would fall, it is valid. Otherwise, they should hold it on their own.
There is an issue of kavanah, since the person is just holding it without being conscious of the fact that they are doing a mitzvah. This is only an issue on the first day. (See link below)

 האם אבל ביום השביעי במנחה אומר תחנון?,"
Yes. This is not considered Tachanun.</s>","בבית האבל אין אומרים גם ביום השביעי במנחה. אבל בבית הכנסת אומרים, וגם האבל עצמו אומר.
מקורות:
כן המנהג.
ובינותי בספרים וראיתי שבנועם מגדים להפמ״ג (בהוצאת עת״ר – ז, א) כתב שהמנהג שאומרים תחנון במנחה. גם בס׳ החיים למהרש״ק סוסי׳ קלא העיד על המנהג לומר תחנון. אלא שכתב שאין המנהג נכון (והביא טעם מחודש שאין האבל מתחייב בדבר שלא הי׳ חייב כל שבעה, והב״ד בדע״ת קלא, ד. וראה עוד בספרו שו״ת שנות חיים מז. וראה מה שכתב לבאר בשו״ת באר שרים או״ח קיח, ט. אבל ראה שם בהשמטות לסי׳ יו״ד – לסי׳ קלא (יג, ב) שיש להעביר קולמוס על מש״כ לפטור גם בביהכ״נ, שהרי בביהכ״נ אין נגררים אחריו. והב״ד בלקט הקמח החדש קלא, מד. אבל ראה שנות חיים קלח טעם שא״צ לתקן). ובפמ״ג קלא במ״ז ט כתב נמי שביום השביעי אומרים.
אמנם, בדרך החיים דיני נפ״א ז, וכ״כ בקיצור שו״ע כב, ה, כתבו שבבית האבל או בבית המת א״א תחנון אפילו ביום השביעי במנחה. והב״ד בכה״ח קלא, נח.  וכ״כ בקצוה״ש כד, ז. ומבואר שנחלקו עם הפמ״ג. ואכתי לא ידענא הלכתא כמאן. וראה בפתחי עולם מרבני אנ״ש קלא, טו שהב״ד הפמ״ג לדינא, ורק במוסגר הביא דעת דרה״ח.  ולכאורה נראה בטעמם, דסברי רבנן שביום ז׳ אכתי מדה״ד מתוחה בבית האבל, ולכן אין אומרים תחנון עד גמר היום. ואכן מצאתי בדרכי החיים כא, ב, שכתב שאין לומר תחנון בבית האבל אפי׳ במנחה ביום ז׳ שלא להגביר מדה״ד שם. והוא כדברינו.
אמנם, בפמ״ג שם אחרי שכתב שביום השביעי אומרים, תלה הדבר בטעם העדר אמירתו, שאם הוא מדין חג אין אומרים גם במנחה.
ולכאו׳ אפ״ל עפ״ז שכיון שאדה״ז הביא רק טעם דוהפכתי חגיכם לאבל אין לומר. אבל אינו מוכרח, בשגם שי״ל שגם בזה שייך מקצת היום, שאף שבחג ליכא מקצת ביום (וה״ט דרבא במו״ק יט, שהלכה כאבא שאול רק ביום שלשים. וראה מצבת משה מו״ק פ״ג בארץ צבי קכ. אבל ראה שו״ת באר יצחק א או״ח כג ד״ה ובאמת – מו״ק יט, ב), הרי באבלות בטל דין חג כשעבר מקצת היום, כדמוכח מאיסור מלאכה שנלמד מדין חג והותר לו אחרי מקצת היום.
ועוד ועיקר בדעת אדה״ז, שכל עניני תחנון תלויים במנהג, ולמעשה המנהג לומר במנחה. וראה כלבו על אבילות ע׳ 279 שהביא ג״כ שאומרים תחנון.
וקצת ראי׳ לדברינו, שהרי כל עיקר דין שמועה רחוקה שנוהגת יום אחד הוא מקרא דוהפכתי חגיכם והרי גם בזה מקצת היום ככולו. (ובדוחק י״ל, דלאו בכל מילי אמרינן מקצת היום שהרי אסור בתשה״מ. ויש מחמירים בקריעה. ואולי הפמ״ג בנה דבריו ע״פ הט״ז שם ט, שכתב דלפי הטעם שהוא מדין חג ״כל ז׳״. והבין הפמ״ג שבא להוסיף גם ביום השביעי אחרי התפלה. אבל אפשר שבא לשלול המנהג לומר אחרי התפלה. או שר״ל שהוא רק כל שבעה ולא יותר. גם י״ל שבא לשלול המנהג שבמנחה בכל הימים נופלים, ראה בשו״ת הריב״ש תיב בשם רב שרירא גאון. ועלה קאמר שבכל ז׳ הימים, בכל היום, דינא הכי. ולא קאי איום שביעי מנחה כשנגמרה אבלות. אלא שמסתבר שבריב״ש דיבר בהווה שהתפללו בביתו רק במנחה ובשחרית באו לביהכ״נ. וראה בתשובות ופירושי רב שרירא גאון טז. ולדברינו סרה תמיהתו של המהדיר שם). ויש לנו להביא ראי׳ מת״ב שא״א תחנון, וכתב בתניא רבתי ענין נפ״א שרק בשחרית אין נופלים ע״פ דאבל איתקש לחג, אבל במנחה נופלים. (אלא שנהגו גם במנחה). ותו, שאם נאמר שתלוי בדין חג, ולגבי זה ליכא דין שמקצת היום, צ״ע ברגל שמבטל גזירת שבעה שלא יאמרו תחנון אחרי הרגל. ולא ראינו מאן דחש לה. ועוד תיקשי שאם תלוי בטעמי העדר האמירה, מדוע נקט הפמ״ג שיאמר, דהא אכתי איכא לטעם דחג לפוטרו. ומאי חזית להעדיף טעמו של הלבוש שכתב עליו במלבושי יו״ט שם א, שבדה טעם מלבו. ועוד שבא״ר ט, הביאו הפמ״ג שם גופא, כתב שגם הלבוש ס״ל לטעם דוהפכתי חגיכם לאבל. ולהעיר שבמ״ז שם טו סיכם הנפק״מ ביו הטעמים והשמיט ד״ז. ונראה בדעת הפמ״ג, שכיון שנהגו שאומרים, העיקר כמנהג שנהגו.
ולולא דברי הפמ״ג אמינא איפכא, שאם מצד מדה״ד מתוחה אין לומר גם במנחה. אבל אם הוא מדין חג, הרי רק האבילות הוקשה לחג וכל שפקעה אבילותו ליכא דין חג. ולדברינו, נראה יותר בטעם הדרה״ח ודעמי׳ שהוא מחמת מדה״ד. וכעין מש״כ השו״מ ביוסף דעת שעו ד״ה והנה בר״ח ניסן, שאין לאבל לומר הלל בבית האבל ביום ז׳ מחמת שהנשמה עדיין אוננת שם. (ובדברי שאול שלו כתב טעם אחר, שאסור בשמחה כל היום. וראה שו״ת פרי השדה ב, קד. אבל ראה פת״ש שעו, ב בשם חמו״ד שיאמר הלל שאז אינו אבל. וכ״כ בשו״ת שאילת שלום תנינא סוסי׳ רח לומר כיון שנפסקה האבילות וליכא משום שמחה, וגם לא משום לועג לרש, שהנשמה כבר אינה אוננת שמה והלכה למנוחתה). וכעי״ז מצינו בא״ז קלג, ג, בנוגע קדימת האבל לקדיש ביום ז׳ במנחה, שאפשר שדין מתוחה עליו כל שבעה. וכ״פ המג״א קלב שהאבל קודם לקדיש עד סוף היום. (אבל ראה ביאור אחר בשו״ת כנסת יחזקאל לאחרי חלק יו״ד בד״ה עוד ראי׳ גדולה בסופו. ובשו״ת מגידות להפמ״ג קע, שיל״ע אי הנפש אוננת כל היום שהרי נוהגין לכבות הנר בשחרית. ומסיק, לומר הלל ביום השביעי אחר יציאה מביהכ״נ. (וראה דע״ק שמנחמין קודם התפלה ואח״כ אומרים הלל. וראה שו״ת צור יעקב קל, ג. ובקיצור שו״ע רז, ו חילק בין חנוכה לר״ח לענין יום השביעי. ולכאו׳ ה״ט שבר״ח הוא רק ממנהגא, והחיוב רק בתפלה, ובחנוכה הוא  דינא, והחיוב כל היום. וראה מסגה״ש שם. ולדעת אדה״ז קלא, ה בחנוכה בלא״ה חייב. ולאידך, בר״ח נמי מצותו כל היום).
ואם נאמר שהיא מחמת מדה״ד בבית האבל, עדיין אין לנו ראי׳ שבבוא האבל לביהכ״נ שלא יאמר הוא תחנון, אף שהציבור אומרים (זולת לסברת ס׳ החיים שהעיד בעצמו שלא נהגו כמותו). ואף שסתימת דבריהם שהדין שוה בכל ז׳ ימי האבילות, ואמטו להכי, כל שאין אומרים בבית האבל אין האבל עצמו אומר בבואו לביהכ״נ – אכתי יש מקום לחלק כנ״ל. ולא מצינו בשום מקום שהאבל עצמו אינו אומר בביהכ״נ ביום השביעי במנחה.
[ואגב, עוד טעם מצינו שלא ליפול מחמת שתחנונים צריכים כוונה יתירה – ראה ס׳ השולחן הל׳ תפלה שער ה – במהדורת בלוי ע׳ רפז. בשם שר שלום גאון. וגם טעם זה לא יכון ביום השביעי].
שוב עיינתי בפמ״ג. ונראה שכוונתו באו״א לגמרי. והמדפיסים, גם במהדו״ח, שיבשו הכוונה. וז״ל בשלימות ללא פיסוק טעמים, וכפי שנדפס בדפו״ר: ״ויראה דביום השביעי במנחה דמקצת ככולו אומרים תחנון ולמנצח יענך ושיר מזמור עיין מ”א אות יו”ד ולטעם חג א״א ולטעם הלבוש י”ל למנצח וכ״כ א״ר ט’ ואבל עצמו לכו״ע לא יאמר למנצח ושיר מזמור״. והנה, אם כוונתו לפי פשוטה, דקאי הכל בנוגע יום השביעי, מאי איריא דלמנצח הכא, שנאמר בעת התפלה בשחרית, וכן גם שיר מזמור לאסף שהוא קודם יציאה מביהכ״נ מיד אחרי שחרית. ובפמ״ג המבואר נדחק בזה. וגם מאי שיאטי׳ דלמנצח לדין יום השביעי, שהרי נוגע בכל ימי שבעה. ולדידי פשיטא, דתרתי קאמר, חדא שביום השביעי אומרים תחנון. ותו, ענין אחר, בנוגע לכל ימי השבעה, שדין למנצח ושיר מזמור כדין תחנון, ולטעם חג אין אומרים כולם בבית האבל אבל לסברת הלבוש אפשר לאומרם, שמדה״ד שייך רק לתחנון ממש. וכ״כ גם בשכנה״ג בהגב״י יד. וכן בא״ר שהביא הפמ״ג. והכל נהיר וצהיר ובריר, וסרו כל התמיהות.
ומכיון שכן, בנוגע לבית האבל שמפורש כתבו כמה פוסקים שלא לומר, הכי נהגינן. וכן מעשה רב בשנת תשמ״ח. אבל כשבא האבל לביהכ״נ, שלא שמענו וראינו הנהגה כזו שהאבל עצמו לא יאמר – אין להנהיג חדשות. והבו דלא לוסיף על גוף הענין שלא לומר בשביעי במנחה, דבפלוגתא תליא, והעידו הפוסקים שהמנהג לומר. וקשה הדבר לומר שיו״ט שלו הוא. ומילתא דתמיהא הוא שהאבל מתפלל כש״צ, וכבר גמרו ימי אבלותו, ואינו אומר תחנון, והציבור אומר. וזו לא שמענו. (משא״כ בהיותו בביהכ״נ במשך השבעה. וראה שו״ת מנח״י ח, כט בנידון דידי׳, שישלח אחר במקומו). ובהיות וכל עניני תחנון תלויים במנהג, והמנהג שבאבל מתפלל במנחה כש״צ כל התפלה, לרבות תחנון, הכי נקטינן.
[ויתר על כן שגם בבית האבל, מקום לספק, גם לדרה״ח ודעמי׳, שבזמננו הרבה פעמים אינו מקום שנפטר שם או שהביאו הנפטר לשם אחרי פטירתו, והוא בית האבל רק מחמת האבלים. והרי נגמרה אבלותם, ומ״ט נבטל מאמירת תחנון בכדי].
ויש להמתיק הענין, שהרי נהגו שא״א תחנון בבית האבל גם כשאין האבל שם, (ודלא כבאה״ט קלא י בשם הט״ז, וכ״ה במקו״ח לחו״י ועוד. וכ״כ חידושים וביאורים להגרא״ז מרגליות, הביאו בהערות הגרא״ד לאוואט על שו״ע אדה״ז קלא, ד,נדפס בהוספות לשו״ע אדה״ז) אם הוא מקום שמת שם, ועל כרחך הטעם כשאין אבל מחמת גוף בית האבל, שהנשמה משוטטת שם ושמדה״ד מתוחה – ראה מלבושי יו״ט א. א״ר ט. שלחן גבוה שפד, יא. וראה גם שו״ת לב חיים ג, מז. ברכות מים מיוחס קלא ד״ה איבעיא להו. פקודת אלעזר קלא, ד. וטעם זה שייך גם כשפקעה האבילות. אבל האבל עצמו נפטר רק מדין חג, וכשנגמרה האבילות בטל דין חג.
וראיתי למי שהעתיק מקצוה״ש שם שכשבא האבל לביהכ״נ ביום השביעי במנחה, האבל אינו אומר אבל הציבור אומר. ולא תפס, דלא קאי בענין זה איום השביעי. והעתיק מדרה״ח ומהקיצור שו״ע בנוגע כללות הענין כשבא האבל לביהכ״נ."

Are men and women allowed to sit together? (At a concert, event, etc.) 
Specifically, regarding concerts, note the following answers from the Rebbe:
1.
In 5748, HASC planned its first “A Time for Music” benefit concert and invited MBD to perform. He agreed on condition that the performance will have separate seating across the whole hall, but the organizers were worried that such an arrangement will cause many people to avoid the concert. MBD offered to go with them to “Sunday Dollars” by the Rebbe and ask the Rebbe for a blessing, asking that the concert be successful despite the separate seating.
The next Sunday the HASC organizers arrived in 770 together with MBD, and after MBD introduced them to the Rebbe he mentioned that they agreed to make the concert with separate seating, and they want a blessing for success. The Rebbe gave them a blessing and the preparations for the concert began.
A few days before the concert was due to take place the organizers were worried, very few tickets were sold, and people said it was because of the separate seating. One of the organizers came up with an idea, to have mixed seating but call it “Family Seating,” thus skirting the Halachic requirement for separate seating. But MBD was steadfast in his refusal and asked the organizers to write to the Rebbe about the problems and their idea. The Rebbe replied:
כל הנ”ל אינו משנה את השולחן ערוך, ברכה והצלחה

" Can an Avel, who has Yartzeit on Chanukah lead the Minyan with Hallel?","
Yes. There is no concern that he will be called up for Mussaf and say Kaddishes without saying Baruch Hu U’Mazor.</s> However it would still not considered proper practice as there may well have been others present at his father' s levaya whose yortzait was during Shabbos or Chagim when they were unable attend any other time of year but now their son can do so in place them because this particular person died around chanuka which happens only once every 25 years! It might also happen where one cannot find anyone else able/willing enough due some reason such illness etc., although even then we wouldn’t encourage people doing things like reciting birchas haToda”a after being mekabel kiddushin by someone already married off; however if necessary – especially outreach purposes - those individuals should try using various means until reaching willing volunteers). The same logic applies here too","An ovel in Shiva may certainly not lead Hallel on Chanukah, even if he has Yartzeit.
Even an ovel during the twelve months since the passing of a parent, should not lead Hallel on Chanukah, but should return to the amud right after Hallel.
The same applies to Rosh Chodesh, but not to Yom Tov or Chol Hamoed, in which case he should stay at the amud for Hallel."
" Is a woman obligated in Melava Malka? Will she have Techiyas Hameisim if she doesn’t?
Regarding the Luz bone needed for Techiyas Hameisim, it is known that eating Melava Malka only by washing for bread will one be zoche for Techiyas Hameisim. Is this strictly for men, or also for women? How much bread? and I was told also a hot drink.
What exactly is the amount you need to eat, and does it apply to women and children? If one does not wash, does it mean one won’t be zoche for Techiyas Hameisim?","
A man must make Kiddush with an entire cup of wine at least 30 ml after Mealcha Eretzel Yom Tov.</s>","
There is a debate whether women are obligated in Melava Malka. According to most authorities they should observe it. Indeed, it considered a segulah for women for easy birth. Likewise, children should be trained in this important mitzvah too.
The luz bone reason applies to women too. However, understandably, one should observe these laws independent of the techiyas hameisim aspect.
Similarly, it would seem that even if someone follows the position of fulfilling this mitzvah through cake or fruit, they will merit the Resurrection. But again, one should observe these laws properly, regardless of this aspect.
Ideally, one is to wash and eat at least a kezayis of bread. It is recommended also to eat hot food or drink.
On the other hand, it isn’t accurate to say the reverse that if one does not eat Melava Malka they will not have techiyas hameisim."
Would my wife be able to light Shabbos candles and then drive to Mikvah to save herself half of the walk?,"
No. She should not do so unless there is no other way for her husband or someone else who can take care that she will fulfill this mitzva with proper intentions.</s>","
There are a number of options. We will list them, in order of priority, the first being the best choice:
The husband only lights the candles. He must be mekabel Shabbos within 10 minutes of candle lighting.
The wife may – in addition to the husband’s lighting – light in the mikvah, or somewhere near the mikvah, provided someone will use the candles for eating purposes there.
She may light candles at home and make a stipulation not to accept Shabbos. She or her husband would still have to accept Shabbos within 10 minutes of lighting."
" Is there a problem with sitting on a table?
I know it is said that Shulchan dome li’Mizbeach but I teach and therefore I spend a good amount of time during the day standing.
To rest my legs and avoid pains I sit on the tables of the kids that are next to me.
Is there a real problem with that?","
Yes.</s> והלאכזין מחדשת</a>, <bdiynes yadayim alav reisah shel chalitzon veyeitzei miklatas hachutzot bshvuram – this applies only when one sits in an area where he has no need for them; if they will be used as needed then even without intentionally touching or using their feet should not make contact etc., see below regarding intentional use). If so we may have issues here because usually these places do get dirty at times especially from fruits which fall onto floor ect.. And sometimes also other people who come over put things like food crumbles down by accident too! Or just spill something while walking past your place since its right near some pathways leading into classrooms/playground areas… As such although generally speaking someone wouldn't eat directly off his shopping cart","

" Does bread need to be properly sealed when delivered by a non-Jew?
Hi, I learned that bread is one of the foods that needs a seal when delivered by a non-Jew. If so, is it permitted to buy kosher pas yisroel bread in non-Jewish stores (Trader Joes, Walmart) if the package is not sealed and just twist-tied or clipped with a “bread clip” (like in the attached picture)?
Also, what about ordering a delivery of such bread from these stores, when the delivery person isn’t Jewish?","
The issue regarding whether an item must have proper supervision for Kashrus applies only on Pareve items which may contain Chometz Zerah/Kitniyot during Sefirah – as long they don't mix together at all stages until after Shabbat Yom Tov there will always remain 10 days between first stage mixing chazirim mamashin bachulav nikurainu al shelo haya shekadoso bi dmochar hamitzvosai min hacholson.” This does apply even though we can never know exactly how much was mixed into any particular batch since each individual piece contains less than enough matza mevushlan.</small>  ראה <ref name=""https://www35682749uscjcsefoodprodstorageblobsprd%eferror_message(null).pdf</references></p><div class","
You may buy such bread in the store, after verifying with the hechsher that it has arrived there in a kosher manner. However, you should avoid getting such bread delivered to you from the store, unless the bags are tied, or the delivery box is sealed."
"I was in question if I ate a kezayis of raisins, but I definitely ate a kezayis of the nuts. The nuts were all from a tree and there were no peanuts. I did not know what after blessing to make. It would seem simple to make an after blessing borei nefashos because of the nuts, yet what about the raisins that I possibly ate enough to make a kezayis? Borei nefashos doesn’t exempt the raisins even bedieved and from the standpoint of the raisins it seems like borei nefashos is an after-blessing made in vain?
Please refer me to the appropriate articles because in my mind this seems like a doubt in blessing from various ways of looking at it.","
If one didn's eat any fruit or vegetable during Shabbat/Yom Tov then they don need worry.</em> ואם בשניתן...למעט</a>. If however he indeed consumed something other than wine – such as fruits for example - his opinion should be followed unless proven otherwise with evidence which can help establish beyond reasonable doubts whether more vinegar fell into him when drink water while eating food on YT before taking bread out;<br />The same applies regarding non kashrus items since their taste will affect both matters equally regardless how much may have fallen onto them without being removed by hand through direct contact alone due its nature whereby some amount falls off naturally over time whereas others fall only upon touch etc., although we must first determine exactly why someone needs take medication especially under medical supervision so these types shouldn&rsquo s rely solely based just having taken pills themselves","
If you’re sure you ate a kezayis of raisins within the time frame of achilas peras, but the majority of the mixture is of a non shivas haminim fruit, it is questionable which ברכה אחרונה to make on a mixture of this sort, only עץ העץ or only בורא נפשות. It’s best to eat a kezayis of fruit from shivas haminim which isn’t from the mixture and recite על העץ which would be acceptable for everything. Where this isn’t possible, the primary opinion is to recite בורא נפשות only. Nonetheless after the fact, if you recited only על העץ, it would be acceptable after the fact according to all.
In a case where you ate two fruits separately and one is a shivas haminim fruit, but you’re not sure if you had a kezayis, it’s questionable whether you should make only על העץ or only בורא נפשות. The primary opinion is to recite only בורא נפשות. Nonetheless, due to doubt, it best to eat a kezayis of fruit from shivas haminim and recite על העץ which would be acceptable for everything. Where this is not possible, eat any food which requires מעין שלש and add the words על העץ for the shivas haminim fruit.
Accordingly, in this case too, where eaten in a mixture, the primary opinion would be to recite just the bracha on the majority fruit, בורא נפשות. However, if you have recited על העץ you are יוצא.
In the case where you ate less than a kezayis of other fruits and you are in doubt if you a kezayis of shivas haminim, you would not make a bracha acharona at all. It would be best to eat a complete kezayis of shivas haminim and exempt everything, or where this is no possible, eat any food which requires מעין שלש and add the words על העץ for the shivas haminim fruit, which covers the other fruit too."
"I was in a quandary as to what to do next. Do I relight the candles from the still lit match, and then continue with asher kideshanu etc.?
Or do I just leave them unlit, and stop saying the bracha midway and rather say Baruch shem kevod…
And of relighting the candle – was that already breaking Shabbos?
(I had in mind that Shabbos comes in after finishing the bracha, not from lighting the candles first, which is why I was wondering why I couldn’t put the match out).
Also, if one should relight the candles, was that ok to just finish the bracha that I had started, or did I have to start the bracha again?","
If there were no other issues at play it would be best for him/her who made Kiddush on behalf others before Yom Tov without their consent; however this may only apply where they also make Matzah Brei.</s>","
Men do not accept Shabbos when lighting candles (though it is still better if they clearly stipulate that they wish not to accept Shabbos), therefore you may relight and put out a fire after lighting. In this case, you should relight the candles and then continue with אשר קדשנו.
No need to make a new bracha. Still best to say ברוך שם later."

The link has","
From a strict halachic standpoint, it would be basically the same thing.
Chassidim are more lenient due to their emphasis on Kavana.
Question:
What are the parameters of Zeman tefillah?
I am not addressing Chatzos, but sof zeman tefillah.
What about minyan?
E.g. if one is about to leave home to shul and then realizes that if he goes to shul/minyan he’ll miss Zman Tefilla?
What about טבילת עזרא? What about someone who’s showering in place of טבילת עזרא?
What about Tallis and/or Tefillin?
E.g. one who’s on a plane or train and the Zman is approaching but he’s not in a position yet that he is comfortable donning T/T.
What about Slichos in the month of Ellul? (Daven before סוז”ת, or first say Slichos)
Surely (if I understand correctly) all of these instances are בכלל not a question when it comes to chatzos. My question then pertains to סוף זמן תפילה.
Answer:
Zeman tefillah should be kept lchatchillah. Only bedieved is one yotze if davening after zeman tefillah. Nonetheless, if it will affect his kavanah, Chassidim are lenient, since kavanah is fundamental to davening.
Thus, tefillah btzibur, tallis/tefillin, selichos etc. do not override zeman tefillah.
