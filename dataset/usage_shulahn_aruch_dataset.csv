There has not yet come up an issue which would cause concern. However it must be noted if one received two doses within six months she should wait at least until her next cycle before receiving another dose.</s>","
This information is incorrect. From my personal experience and after investigation with other rabbonim too, there is absolutely no basis for this rumor. This has been verified with Rabbonim who work specifically in the area of answering taharas hamishpacha questions full time, fielding Taharas Hamishpacha Hotlines, and heading a Beis Hora’ah for taharas hamishpacha matters.
There are many rumors, lies, half-truths and propaganda out there. In this matter specifically, I’ve heard so-called “reliable sources” quoting in the name of a particular well-known Rav, who deals regularly with taharas hamishpacha that he has seen such issues, only to find out upon investigation directly with him, that he too states that in his experience – as well as his investigation with others – this is untrue.
As always, I suggest that any information relating to medical issues such as vaccines should be gleaned from medical professionals and doctors. When there are conflicting opinions, as in any other matter, one should follow the majority opinion, the consensus established by mainstream doctors. This is the general halachic viewpoint, and particularly when it comes to medical issues.
This is all the more critical nowadays when there is an alarming rise in conspiracy theories on social media. The non-discerning individual, and many of us belong to that category, particularly if not steeped in a solid medical education, would have a difficult time being able to separate fact from fiction. Therefore, the first rule of thumb is not to believe anything shared about medical issues and everything must be checked and verified with the professionals.

In general, there’s a Machlokes if a father and son (or son and father, or two brothers) can get Shvi’i and Maftir. In practice, it may only be done when these Aliyos are being read from two different Sifrei Torah (e.g., on a Shabbos Rosh Chodesh).

In this case, the first relative should leave the Bima before the second comes up for Maftir.
Consequently, in the case you mentioned, it would only be permitted (after the fact, as above) if the Yahrtzeit is on Shabbos.

This is a general question about the infallibility of Torah sages. To address this properly is beyond the scope of this platform, but I’ll make some general observations.
There are two basic approaches to this general question:
One must follow what the rabbonim say even if they are in error, as this is the desire of Hashem. In other words: while their arguments might not be true, the halacha follows their position even if it’s not true.
An alternative approach is that a person must consider the fact that Hashem will certainly protect the rabbonim and ensure that they don’t make any mistakes.
Of course, one should always take into account that it is very likely that they’re not in error to begin with, and the only reason one thinks they are mistaken is because one does not have accurate information or is not that advanced in one’s Torah knowledge.
As for the examples you mentioned, vaccines and shul closures, without getting into the specific details of those matters: while in your opinion they might have been in the wrong, it could very well be that the rabbonim possess all the information that you have, but are aware of many other details and facts which you’re not aware of which impacted their decision. Indeed, many people maintain that those decisions have actually saved many lives. As mentioned, once they reached this decision, their position should be followed regardless.
The example you gave about the ex-communication of the Chasidim in Vilna is very different. The halacha is that when Beis Din judges an individual or a group, they may not accept testimony about their behavior without allowing the individual to hear the testimony and be given a chance to challenge it. Furthermore, once they have heard incriminating evidence without the individual being present at the time, they may no longer rule on this case. Any dispute which involves a plaintiff and defendant may only be ruled on if both parties are present and are allowed to present their position in front of the court. If this process has not been followed the ruling is meaningless and void.
This is in contrast to general halachic rulings which involve determining correct or incorrect behavior, where one must obviously follow the position of Torah sages and rabbonim, even if one tends to disagree.
The fundamental difference here is: this applies only when judging a person, when adjudicating a dispute, not when determining a halacha."

You do not say it again.
Explanation:
The “cutoff” for the requirement to say Tefilas Haderech again (whether one said the words “vesachazireinu leshalom” or not) is morning (– following the same rules as Birchas Hatorah, that it is recited every morning).
This applies even if one didn’t sleep the entire night – as soon as alos comes (and one is still traveling), a new Tefilas Haderech should be recited.

It depends on what type of vegetable it is (see below).
Regardless, If it’s possible to strain it in a way that even small bugs won’t go through and it’s not a thick soup, then yes.
If you are dealing with vegetables that are assumed automatically to contain bugs, the vegetable shouldn’t be eaten. Checking wouldn’t help then (if it softens through cooking). With regular vegetables that only occasionally contain bugs, it would be allowed (if you don’t see bugs there). Even so, there is still reason to be Machmir when cooking a large amount."

Many of these methods have already been discussed by recent Poskim, and there are different opinions on the matter.
Generally, the Rebbe discouraged use of such methods. In the Rebbe’s words:
“With regard to your question about using the services of Mrs. … who heals without using any healing remedies at all: Inasmuch as “Torah has granted permission for the healer to heal,” I don’t understand why one should pursue unfathomable paths.”

(See also Igros Kodesh vol. XVIII p. 17: “Why is he seeking out new methods and new matters when we have the paved path of Torah and mitzvos”).
See here at length: Chabad.org/Alternative Medicine in Jewish Law
Though for a person who’s exhausted finding help in traditional medical remedies, there might be some room on occasion to allow the use of alternative ones, and even those with a sketchy track record (see here), initially, help should be sought out at traditional physical and mental health professionals, which have a proven track record and are halachically regarded as doctors to the extent that one may be Michalel Shabbos (if needed) based on their opinion.

The common custom is not eat them.</sm>","
The dinim of Shmitah and the way they apply in Chutz La’aretz can be complex, but to summarize:
Fruits: Fruits grown in Eretz Yisroel during the year of Shmitah, even if grown without any human effort, have a level of holiness to them and may be only eaten in a certain way, may not be disposed of when still edible, and for most fruit, must be made hefker at a certain point of the year (known as the zman biur) etc.
Vegetables: Additionally, the Chachomim decreed well as that all vegetables grown during Shmitah, even if grown without any human effort, may not be eaten at all, even in Eretz Yisroel. This is known as the prohibition on Sefichei Shvi’is. The reason for this prohibition was that since vegetables can be harvested not too long after planting (as opposed to fruit trees which can take years to mature,) we are worried that unscrupulous individuals will plant vegetables during Shmitah and claim that they just grow on their own.
They also ruled that Shmitah fruit may not be removed from Eretz Yisroel (even though they retain their holiness when removed).
Therefore, since we cannot be sure that the red peppers, were grown and harvested before the start of the year of Shmitah, they may not be eaten. However they may not be discarded either, since they retain the holiness of Shmitah. Therefore they should be left in their place to a point which they are no longer edible,(at which point they lose their holiness,) and then they may be discarded normally.

Nowadays, personal fasts are not recommended.
The Alter Rebbe writes in the third chapter of Igeret HaTeshuvah that fasting – with the exception of mandatory public fast days – must never come at the expense of one’s health or strength. If fasting will weaken you to the extent that you will not be able to serve G‑d that day with the same energy and vigor as you would have had you eaten—don’t. In fact, the Talmud is very clear about this: One who fasts despite the fact that it weakens him, is called a sinner.
In today’s day and age, when most of us are used to eating three round meals a day, there is almost no one who can claim to be unaffected by fasting.
More importantly, it is the spirit of repentance, the true repentance, that comes along with fasting that counts.
Rather, instead of fasting one should do as the Alter Rebbe brings from the words of Daniel, when advising Nebuchadnezzar: “Redeem your sins with charity, and your wrongdoing by being kind to the needy”. This can be done by donating to a charitable cause the monetary value of the food you eat on a given day.
The Rebbe explains that our generation is even weaker than the Alter Rebbe’s time and accomplishes even these fasts that he permits through tzedaka."

 Is it permissible to pay for non-Jewish workers to eat Treif in a Jewish-owned Halal store?,"

It’s allowed. This applies only if the food never enters your ownership and you do not touch the food, rather you are just paying them for it. The payment can be made in either of the following methods:
You could tell them “Here’s money and buy yourself food”, as long as you don’t specify what the food is.
You can tell the storekeeper give them food and I will pay you.
However, you may not give money to the storekeeper in advance so they should be able to buy there.
If the items you’re buying do not contain food which is assur b’hana’ah (forbidden to benefit from), such as beef, lamb, or goat meat and dairy mixed together while hot, for instance a beef hamburger with cheese, or pizza with pepperoni, you may even give money to the storekeeper in advance.
Some allow in this case – where it’s not assur b’hana’ah – even buying the food outright if it’s to feed your workers, but not to give as a gift (unless it’s food which only forbidden rabbinically). It’s advisable to be stringent not to buy forbidden food to feed workers, even if it’s not assur b’hana’ah, unless it’s food which only forbidden rabbinically.

"I am unable to understand the Rav’s statement. Is the Rav saying that taking upon unnecessary, random new stringencies in life, actually make a person become lenient in other Halachic matters?","
The Rebbe was referring specifically about Chassidus and Torah study.</ s>","
Yes. There’s a concept in Halacha called “chumra d’asi lidei kula” – a stringency that leads to a leniency.
There are many ways such a thing is possible. As a general rule, any chumra should be done bli neder. Otherwise, it could cause a stumbling block.
Sometimes the obsession over a specific stringency does not allow a person the emotional strength to give attention and focus on the fundamentals.
Taking on a stringency in a place where other people do not practice this behavior can sometimes come along with a feeling of haughtiness and looking down upon others, or at least it might be considered “mechezei k’yuhara”, it appears as though one is showing off.
In a case where the particular stringency is very difficult for a person, it may be difficult for the person to serve Hashem with simcha. It might even cause the person to resent it, and as a result, they might resent other areas of yiddishkeit too.
As a general rule, one must ensure that any stringent behavior is in accordance with a person’s current standing in avodas Hashem, as we are not encouraged to jump to levels that are higher than us, both because it might lead to a downfall in other areas and additionally because our avoda should be bi’pinimiyus, grounded and internalized.
In the particular case in the link above, there could be a number of reasons why this would lead to a leniency in other areas. Aside for the above-mentioned reasons which apply here as well, it could create a problem in Shalom Bayis or similar problems.
Of course, there are many advantages to taking upon oneself stringencies, particularly in the area of tznius. However, this must be done in an appropriate manner, under the guidance of one’s mashpia etc."

Is there an issue with having a blacktallis gadol with white strips, instead of the standard white beged with black strips? The actual tzitzis strings would remain white as normal.","

Strictly speaking, there are no Halachic requirements relating to the color of the garment. However, the Poskim, including the Alter Rebbe, write that it should be white and consistent with the Tzitzis strings, in order to fulfill the Mitzva according to all opinions.
The black stripes are also sourced in Halacha (although not required, and some insist that the garment be completely white without any stripes), as well as in Kabbala.
In my opinion, doing otherwise would be considered a change to the traditional manner and should not be done.
Follow up Question:
What if the person is asking because he is trying to follow a Yemenite custom from way back. Does that change what someone should do today?
Answer:
If he is indeed Yemenite and there are still currently Yemenite communities that do so it is okay. To the best of my knowledge, even Yemenite communities currently do not wear black talleisim. Even in the past, this was only done for the weekday tallis. (It is assumed that since they wore their tallis – which is very long in Yemenite tradition – all day it was extremely difficult to have it white which would make it very dirty. Even if they would make it white it would end up turning out black because they wore it even throughout work etc.).
See references below from Yemenite sources.
In any event, since the Yemenite custom was to make the tzitzis always white, it would be correct to make the Tallis this way too, in accordance with the Rambam – the key halachic authority for Yemenites – which maintains that tallis and tzitzis should always be the same color."

Indeed, when not during lenining, such as during the farbrengen, the Rebbe usually used a different Chumash. Others propose because it has on the bottom teachings of Chazal relating to the Pesukim.

Even a leader or Dayan etc. should not do so unless his services are needed by the people ‘blocking’ his way.
Additionally, there is an ancient custom not to step or jump over young kids, and if one did do so he would reverse and jump back over the kid backwards in order to “rectify” somewhat that which has been done. It has been explained that all of this is so that the kid shouldn’t experience difficulties growing properly. Various reasons have been given to this custom and are brought down in seforim."

You should try your best to start davening earlier. In case you were unable to daven beforehand, most poskim maintain that you should Daven without a Minyan in order to Daven before Sof Zman Tefillah.

 When is the last time to make a Chanuka Habayis. Can one do it a year after move-in date?,"
If this would be done for Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur – yes; otherwise no.</s>","Q. When is the last time to make a Chanuka Habayis. Can one do it a year after move-in date?
A. If it has not been done yet it should be done within a year. Best to schedule to have some of the mezuzos checked and affix them at the event, as long as you don’t delay because of this the affixing of the mezuzos.
There’s no prohibition of doing it afterwards but it loses most of the significance.

 Does oat flour need to be kosher in general? Does Chabad eat Matzah made out of oats?,"
Yes. Often they do.</s>","Kashrus:
Oat flour is inherently kosher and requires no hechsher for year-round use (not for Pesach), if there are no added kosher sensitive ingredients.

Matzah:
There are serious shaalos with oat matzoh since they are treated with heat in order to store them. There are available oat matzos that are not treated with heat. These should be used when necessary. Even so, wheat matzah is always preferred.

First of all, if they gave it to you by mistake, due to a miscalculation or the like, you must return the money to them.
If they gave it to you as compensation for the time that they had the money in their hands, in other words, interest, then it would depend:
If you did not give him the money for any purpose, and you never turned the debt into a loan, you would be permitted to keep the money.
However, if you gave him the money to buy something and he used it for himself, or you turned it into a loan, it would be forbidden for him to give you the interest and for you to receive it, but you need not return it after the fact.

I am descended from the Shaloh hakadosh and my family minhag is not to eat turkey.

There’s no reason why one would be stringent in this matter.</sm>","
Indeed, not all descendants of the Shaloh have adopted this minhag. But those who have done so should continue adhering to it. Many descendants of the Shaloh follow this minhag even though they’re not ben achar ben.

In regards to serving a Jew these type of beverages, there might be room for leniency depending on the circumstances. If however it involves pouring the client a ‘non kosher’ beverage on the spot for him to taste or drink, it may not be done.
However, the main issue here is handling and benefiting from forbidden beverages and especially wine.
Nevertheless, so long they sell other beverages which are not forbidden to have benefit from and the person handles and receives benefit and pay from these beverages as well, one may be lenient in this particular case."
