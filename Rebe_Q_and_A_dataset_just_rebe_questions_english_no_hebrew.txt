###question 
  May I put a frozen bag of vegetables etc. on my body on Shabbos as it might melt from my body heat?
If the answer is yes, may I cool myself off with these packets of frozen milk knowing and benefiting from the fact that they will melt? If neither of these are acceptable,may I use a cold cloth placed in the freezer?.
 ###answer 
 
1) One may handle ice packs to cool off with, since only a small amount of water is melted, there is no intention of melting them and the melted water is going to waste. Melting ice is problematic when one actively melts it, or even when no action is taken if this his intention, for example if wants to melt it save the melted water – which is not applicable in this case.
However, frozen food items like meat and vegetables should not be used since they are muktzah.
2) Since you want to melt the milk, you should not purposely use it to cool off so as to proactively melt it.
3) Cold towels that are not wet and will not become squeezed is permissible to use.###question 
  Can I get a heter to be intimate with my husband during the day?
Hi, I am nine months pregnant and too tired most of the time to be intimate at night. Can I get a heter to be intimate with my husband during the day?.
 ###answer 
 
According to halacha, relations must be at night or even after break of dawn until it’s light enough where people can recognize each other (misheyakir), the time when one may put on tefillin, provided it’s dark. This affects also the mazal as well as the neshama of the child born from these relations.
Ideally, you should attempt to do the same, but where this proves very difficult, and particularly in your case of pregnancy where it’s not for the purpose of conception, there is room for leniency. However, you should ensure that the room is completely dark, or at least cover yourself completely with a blanket that no light enters. If possible, one should schedule relations for Shabbos day.###question

  Does one need to ask a Rav before being induced? Is there any Halachic issue?.
 ###answer 
 
This matter is discussed in a number of Poskim. The general rule is that one may not induce or rush the onset of labor unless there are clear medical reasons to require it. Some of the reasons for this prohibition are because:
There is a level of risk inherent to childbirth, and one should therefore not hasten it even though it is bound to come.
The special assurance of protection Hashem provides at the time of childbirth does not necessarily apply to the same degree if the birth is hastened without a clear medical need.
The procedures and/or medicines involved in induction can themselves cause complications, and one should not take that risk needlessly.###question 
  Can one bring a Sefer Torah to their son who is Bar Mitzvah for Leining in their house without Minyan on Zoom with family? No Birchas Hatorah just Leining. Friday afternoon. Has been preparing..
 ###answer 
 One should not transfer the Sefer Torah out of it’s set place to bring to read it in a home.
There is no such an obligation to read the Torah on a Friday afternoon, similarly there is no need to do it with a Kosher Sefer Torah.
Certainly there can be other ways to share the simcha of the Bar Mitzvah boy’s simcha of joining to being obligated in the mitzvos.

  What are the Halachos of Yichud when using Uber? .
 ###answer 
 Uber:
Almost all of the Halachos of driving a regular car apply to a taxi or Uber, i.e. one may travel when it is lit up and during the time when there are people in the street (on those streets), and the windows are not tinted in a way that someone can’t see into the car.(    ’  ” )
However, there are those that are Machmir and hold that wherever possible, one should not travel with a non-Jew or a ‘Parutz’ even by day  (     ’ ). With an Uber there is more room for leniency, as there are governing laws of the company for drivers, with GPS monitoring.
Parutz:
There is a Machlokes in Poskim how to define a Parutz. One must be especially careful in this regard when exposed to Yichud on a regular basis, such as in a workplace.
It is clear that a person who is not particular with the Issur of Kriva L’arayos and does not keep the guidelines of Tznius, even if he otherwise a Shomer Torah U’mitzvos, is  certainly considered  a Parutz. For example, a man who has no inhibitions about embracing women or girls, one who regularly watches television, reads unsuitable material, frequents indecent chat rooms on the internet, or visits movie theaters is considered a Parutz. The mere exposure to immodesty affects their morality. See Toras HaYichud 3:2:4. Shevet Halevi Vol. 5:202:1.
A man whose business dealings are questionable might be considered a Parutz in relation to Yichud — see Nitei Gavriel Yichud 22:9.
Furthermore, the average non-observant Jew is to be considered a Parutz too. The Tzemach Tzedek E”H 39 rules, that the definition of Anashim Ksheirim is one who has a special Chezkas Kashrus, such as a Talmid Chacham, and the standard Chezkas Kashrus of all Klal Yisroel isn’t sufficient. It seems that it need not be Mamosh a Talmid Chacham; it could be a Yeshiva Bachur etc., but it is not enough that we are not aware of any Pritzus behavior. See also Nitei Gavriel Yichud 19:3,10.

 Our son was born on 19 Iyar. This year Erev Shavuos is on Shabbos. When should we make the Upshernish – on Friday 4 of Sivan or Tuesday Isru Chag?.
 ###answer 
 
• Generally:
For a child whose birthday is from after Lag Baomer until Erev Shavuos, the Upshernish haircut should take place on Erev Shavuos. [When Erev Shavuos falls on Shabbos – on 4 Sivan (with the exception of someone whose birthday is on Erev Shavuos, in which case it should be postponed until after Shavuos)].
See more in the following pages:
https://asktherav.com/4243-when-should-one-get-his-hair-cut-before-shavuos-this-year-since-erev-shavuos-is-shabbos/
https://asktherav.com/13133-when-should-a-boy-start-wearing-kippa-and-tzitzis/
• However, regarding someone whose birthday is on 19 Iyar, a day after Lag Baomer:
There are instructions from the Rebbe to perform the haircut on Lag Baomer.
While in most places it appears that it should take place on Lag Baomer itself (during the day), a day before the child turns 3, others record that it should be done on the actual birthday, right after nightfall on the night after Lag Baomer.
See here the testimony of three people who were all instructed by the Rebbe to do it on Lag Baomer: R. SB Popak, R. YY Hecht and R. Refoel Hartman. In the case of R. Hecht, the Rebbe himself did the cutting. (This information has been independently verified by us). In the case of R. Hartman, we have the actual answer of the Rebbe.
Independent of the above, there is yet another directive presented regarding the Upshernish of Ari Halberstam hy”d (whose birthday is on 19 Iyar), of which there are pictures of the Rebbe cutting the hair. See in the Hebrew references below.
This account raises several questions. Regardless, I feel there is enough information to rely upon to do it on Lag Baomer (by day).###question

 ###answer 
 Initially one should make the Bracha on a large and whole bread. If there isn’t any whole bread, the Bracha should be made on the larger piece.
When one will cut the bread into a smaller piece after making the Bracha before eating, the bread should be dipped it into the salt only after cutting that slice (as done at the Shabbos meal).
If, however, the (larger) slice of bread is already small and one will ingest it as is, one should dip it into the salt before making the Bracha.###question 
  We have a new toaster oven. Which parts, if any, need to be Toiveled?.
 ###answer 
 A utensil does not require Tevilah when it does not come into direct contact with food when it is being prepared, served or eaten.
Therefore, the oven racks should be Toiveled, as food is sometimes placed directly on it. Similarly, the other components that come into direct contact food should be Toiveled. However, the oven itself need not be immersed. (Yoreh De ’ah 120).

 I do a lot of street-mivtzoim throughout sukkos and at times when people are rushing I tell them just to hold the lulav and esrog together. Sometimes they do it but don’t get full grasp, so I have to hold it together with them (to assure it doesn’t fall). My question is: are they still  or do they have to be fully holding the lulav and esrog on their own?.
 ###answer 
 
There are several issues here:
The requirement of taking lulav. They need to close their fingers or even better lift it. At the very least, according to some opinions, holding it in such a way that it doesn’t fall is also considered taking.
The fact that two people are holding it together: If they hold in such a way that without your support it would not fall and you are just assisting, and reversely, without them holding it, it would fall, it is valid. Otherwise, they should hold it on their own.
There is an issue of kavanah, since the person is just holding it without being conscious of the fact that they are doing a mitzvah. This is only an issue on the first day. (See link below)
Likewise, it might not be considered a kinyan and therefore not theirs. This also is only an issue on the first day, and ideally one should be concerned about this on the second day too.###question 
  I see many people pick up the coins from Machatzis Hashekel a bunch of times when giving it. Is there a reason for this?.
 ###answer 
 The common custom is to exchange our personal money with the silver half dollars owned by the Shule. We lift up the Shule’s silver coins in order to acquire them and then give them to tzedaka. Some individuals give machatzis hashekel also on behalf of family members, and therefore they pick up the silver coins several times, to acquire them again after each time they gave them to tzedakah.
There are individuals who for some inexplicable reason have a custom that even if they are only giving only on their own behalf they lift up the coins three times. This custom has no known source or explanation. Some say that’s what the Rebbe did (although it could very well be that he was giving on behalf of others).###question

  Is an oven with Cook-time or Stop-time Mode acceptable for Shabbos use?.
 ###answer 
 There are many ovens on the market, and it is impossible in this short space to investigate and address every single model. The best we can do is provide a summary of the many issues to look out for. It is important that you read through the manuals of any model you are considering for purchase, in order to determine whether, and to what degree, the issues outlined below apply.
Thermostat:
The main problem with using a oven on Shabbos is the thermostat, which is affected by opening or closing the oven while the oven is on. When the oven door is opened, the thermostat will detect the cold air that rushes in and will activate the heating element if it is off at that moment. It is forbidden to cause this to occur, even if all the food will be removed all at once before the oven door is re-closed. [If the oven door is re-closed with some of the food remaining inside, there may be additional concerns of Bishul on Shabbos, depending on the circumstances.]  The thermostat is not a concern for Yom Tov use, but there are additional problems with a oven on Yom Tov as detailed below.
If the oven is off, like after the cook-time or stop time has finished this would not be an issue.
the problem with using such an oven on Yom Tov is primarily a practical one; most modern ovens have an auto shut-off feature that turns the oven off after around 6-12 hours. Yet another problem, applicable on both Shabbos and Yom Tov, is that many models have lights or fans that are activated and deactivated as the door is opened or closed. In summary, a modern oven without Sabbath Mode may be completely unusable on Shabbos and Yom Tov.
Ovens with “Sabbath Mode”:
Buying an oven with Sabbath Mode will alleviate many of these problems. Sabbath Mode will generally disable the oven’s display panel and any electronic controls, as well as disengage the fans and lights from being activated by opening and closing the oven door. The Sabbath Mode feature will also disable the auto shut-off feature. However, one very big problem, at least with regards to most models, is that the thermostat usually remains operative. [Some ovens have a light which illuminates when the heating element is on, in which case the oven could theoretically be opened when the light is on. However, it has been demonstrated through rigorous testing that these indicator lights are generally inaccurate, and may be illuminated even when the heating element is off.]
The thermostat does not present a problem for Yom Tov use, but makes it completely forbidden on Shabbos, according to most opinions. The outcome is that, ironically, the Sabbath Mode oven remains forbidden for Shabbos use, and is permitted only on Yom Tov. Perhaps it would have been more apt to name this feature “Yom Tov Mode”.
There is a practical workaround for Shabbos use that is easy and simple: Estimate about what time the main course will be served, and make sure that the oven turns off before then. This is generally easy to achieve, as the Sabbath Mode feature can usually be set to turn the oven off in any increment amount of time up until 72 or 96 hours. So, you can easily set the oven to go off after 2 or 3 hours, for example. Once the oven is off, opening the door does not create a problem with regards to the thermostat.
However, this method will usually create a new problem, which requires its own workaround. Now that the oven is off, this means that Sabbath Mode is now deactivated as well, and opening the door will turn the light on (if the oven has a light). This can be circumvented before Shabbos by manipulating the magnets or levers that detect whether the door is open. The specific manner of circumvention will vary from model to model, and in the case of magnetic detectors, may take some trial-and-error. Some oven doors are designed to be taken apart to allow proper cleaning of all the glass panes, and the magnet can be physically removed from the door. In other models, it may work to place a strong and thin magnet on the oven wall at the correct place.(The location of the oven’s magnet can usually be detected by sliding a paperclip around the top of the oven door.) These options may or may not work, depending on the model, so you would have to try before Shabbos, when you have the time and patience to troubleshoot it. [Note: Disabling the magnetic sensor only helps with regards to the functions controlled by the door sensor, such as the oven light and fans. However, the thermostat is not controlled by the door sensor, which is why the oven needs to be off before opening the door on Shabbos.]
Following the advice above, when Shabbos is followed by Yom Tov, one would have to choose whether to reserve the oven’s use for Shabbos or Yom Tov, as using it on Shabbos would require the oven to be set to turn off on Shabbos, in which case it will remain off for the duration of Yom Tov as well.
The Issur of Sheiyah with regards to an oven:
The above answer focuses purely on using the oven itself. However, there are also restrictions about which foods may be placed in an oven before Shabbos without a Blech, and much discussion about whether, and how, a Blech can be facilitated in an oven. Here is a brief summary of the issues:
From the Torah perspective, one may place food over an open flame before Shabbos in order that it cooks on Shabbos. Nevertheless, Chazal forbade this due to the concern that a person may come to stoke the fire on Shabbos in order to speed up the cooking process. This prohibition is knownas Shehiya.
One method of avoiding Shehiya is to cover the flames, typically with a Blech. Covering the fire indicates that one does not desire a strong flame, it diverts his attention from the fire, and it serves as a reminder not to increase the flames. With regards to an oven, there is a dispute whether – and how – a Blech can be adequately created. In practice, a Blech in an oven should be situated so that it covers the heating elements, which may be located either at the top of the oven, the bottom or the backwall. In many ovens, there are heating elements in all of these places.
Another way of addressing Shehiya, and to sidestep the need for a Blech, is to ensure that the food is cooked prior to Shabbos. It is sufficient if the food is already half cooked.  This fraction does not represent time, but rather, is qualitative and measured against the degree of cooking most people would regard as fully cooked. Nevertheless, for a number of reasons, it is best that the food be fully baked before Shabbos.
There is yet a third possible way to circumvent the prohibition of Shehiya. Chazal allowed one to put completely raw meat on an open flame just before the onset of Shabbos. They were not concerned that one might come to stoke the flames, because doing so would not serve any productive purpose – it would not ready the meat in time for the Friday night meal, nor would it be necessary to ready the meat in time for the Shabbos day meal. This leniency is known as “Kidra Chaysa” – literally: raw pot. (Indeed, some people may wish to put raw chicken and rice right before Shabbos to slow bake in the oven for the daytime Seudas Shabbos.)
In order for this leniency to apply, two criteria must be met. First, the food item must be one that takes a relatively long time to cook properly (such as meat). Second, the food must be put on the fire just before Shabbos, late enough that it will not begin cooking before Shabbos comes in. Some contemporary Poskim therefore assert that this leniency seldom applies nowadays, because most modern cooking appliances are able to cook in a relatively short amount of time. As a case in point, meat put up to cook rightat the  onset of Shabbos would usually be fit for consumption by the time the meat course  arrives. Even if the heat is set to low, this does not diminish the oven’s overall ability to bake quickly, because the seat heating can be easily raised. Thus, according to these Poskim, this option is not applicable to a modern oven.
Other associated issues:
1. It should be pointed out that even when the oven is off and cold, if it will be turned on with a Shabbos clock or a timer (see next point), one may not place inside any food which is not completely cooked. Furthermore, even completely cooked food that has cooled down may not be placed inside either, unless the food is completely dry (and will remain dry when heated). The same applies to an oven which will remain off but has  not yet cooled down.
2. With regards to Shabbos clocks in general, the Rebbe writes in a letter (Igros Kodesh Vol 12 page 192): “There are those who are extremely stringent and are even sceptical about the permissibility of using a Shabbos clock… Therefore, I am abstaining from giving this idea in an official capacity.” Even so, it is reported that the Rebbe instructed some individuals that they may be used (See Shulchan Menachem Volume 2 page 173).  At the same time, many authorities who permit Shabbos clocks in general nevertheless rule that they should not be used with regards to cooking specifically, for a number of reasons.

  Can a Sukkah be built under a screened enclosure?
Hi Rabbi Braun,
Someone moving to our community is looking into buying this house. They have a big sukkah and only place it will fit is in their backyard. The issue is that their whole backyard is screened. They want to know is they can build it under a screened enclosure.
I found this discussed in   ,  and he seems to say it’s fine. I’m not sure if his svoro/psak is correct. Is his psak accurate? Can it be done?
See attached pic of enclosure and the tshuva..
 ###answer 
 
Being that the screen is pasul for schach, that renders the area of schach directly under the screen invalid. One would therefore need to estimate that if one were to remove those areas of schach which is directly under each wire, whether the sukkah would still have more shade than sun.

  Can giving money towards a Kallahs gifts before her wedding (bridal shower), be taken from Tzedaka money (Maasar)?
Asking regarding friends, as well as acquaintances that I wouldn’t necessarily buy a gift for, but want to help towards their marriage..
 ###answer 
 
One may use maaser to buy a gift for a chosson/kallah, provided that the following conditions are in place:
The chosson/kallah are considered poor and eligible to receive maaser.
It’s not an expected norm that people give gifts to chosson/kallah.
You have not already resolved to give a gift, prior to your thought of using maaser money.
See also:
Can I use Maaser money towards airfare to go to a friend’s wedding?
Follow-up Questions:
1. What makes someone “poor”? Many people do not have enough money to pull off wedding expenses…
2. While it can be the norm to give gifts, one doesn’t MUST give a gift, so a gift might be given with only the intention of helping the kallah who needs it. (Or to make her happy).  Does that count?
3. On another note, does maasar need to be given from the monthly interest earned from the bank?
Answers:
1. Each case can be different. The general rule is if someone’s salary doesn’t cover their expenses for that year they may take tzedakah. For example if he makes $1,500 a month and it cost him $2,000 a month to live he will be able to collect the $500 from tzedakah.
   ’ ’ .
While it is true many people do not have enough money to pull off wedding expenses and they would be halachicly permitted to take from tzedakah, some choose instead to take a loan and when things are easier and there are less expenses they pay back that loan at a slower pace rather than take tzedakah. Obviously the latter is the preferred option if possible. But if it’s not possible as mentioned above they would be permitted to take money from tzedakah for the wedding.
2. A simple test to determine this would be: ask yourself whether you would give the gift if you wouldn’t be able to use maaser funds for it. If the answer is yes then you wouldn’t be able to use maaser funds for the gift, if not you would be able to use maaser funds. If you would have bought a cheaper gift then the difference would be able to come from maaser.

It would also be advisable to refrain from saying anything until they’ve arrived home and are no longer carrying something.

  Can a lady give a Shiur to men?
Full Question:
I run a lunch and learn in my office, the crowd is mixed and diverse, and we bring different speakers every week. It was suggested from our main sponsor to have a lady (who is fully Frum and Tznius) to give the Shiur/lecture. Is this permissible? Obviously, I am in a sensitive position. If the answer is in the negative, I would need to present it to the local rabbinic authority, and present the sources in Halacha..
 ###answer 
 
This is not proper for a religious crowd. Poskim advise against this. (Men need to look at the speaker, and to have men looking at a woman speak for a long period of time is not Tznius. We find in the Poskim that by the age of 9, it is important to have only male teachers).
Some poskim even forbid it outright.
(See Shaarei Yosher III: 21. Shevet Halevi 3:14. Mishnah Halachos 5:218. 11: 58. L’horos Nasan 1 EH 60:5. Igros Moshe OC 5: 12. See also ibid. 2:36).
However, if the crowd is not religious, and the purpose is to teach them Torah, there could be some room for leniency in very specific scenarios, and one should seek guidance from a Rav.###question 
  May one interrupt while reading Shnayim Mikra?.
 ###answer 
 The Alter Rebbe (OC 285:6) states that some are accustomed to read the entire week’ s Shnayim Mikra without interruption at all, but that according to the basic Halacha, one may interrupt it and read “one Parsha today . . and another Parsha tomorrow”. [In this context, Parsha refers to a segment of Pesukim in the Torah that appears without any space between the Pesukim, also known as  .]
This implies that if one does not wish to read the entire week’s Shnayim Mikra at once, he may interrupt only when there is a break in the Torah between Parshiyos.
From this it can be inferred that:
1. It is ideal to read the entire week’s Shnayim Mikra without interruption at all.
2. It is acceptable to pause when there is a break in the Torah between Parshiyos.
3. One should not interrupt within a Parsha at all.
Although point 3 is only implicit in the Alter Rebbe, the Mishna Brura (Shaar Hatziyon 285:11) states this explicitly.
It should be noted that obviously where necessary one may interrupt.###question 
  Reform Books: Garbage or Shaimos?
I found a big book on a shelf in Shul that is put together by reform “Rabbis” and L’havdil “based on Tanach”. I hesitate if to put it in the Garbage because I believe it quotes a lot of Tanach. On the other hand, I think it would be Mivazeh the Geniza to bury it with real Shaimos. What should be done with such a book?.

What about when Rosh Chodesh is Shabbos-Sunday – do we say “limochoroso bayom harishon“?.
 ###answer 
 
There is no clarity about the minhag (see references below). The common minhag is only to say  when Rosh Chodesh is on the following Shabbos and Sunday.
If it is just the upcoming Sunday (the day after Shabbos Mevorchim)  is recited:   .###question 
  How can I enter my building on Shabbos if the door can only be opened with an electric key?
I need an electric key to enter the building I live in (attached is a picture of the key). On Shabbos, they try to put something in the door that it shouldn’t lock, sometimes though some  from the building take it out and it gets locked. The question therefore is:
1. Can one carry this key on their bendel on Shabbos?
2. Can one give the key on Shabbos to a goy passing by (and ask them) to open the door
Note, there is no other way to enter the building!.
 ###answer 
 
The key is Muktzah given that its primary purpose cannot be used for Shabbos. It therefore cannot be touched with one’s hands. If it is the only key on the Bendel, you would not be able to put the Bendel on or take it off with your hands. However, you may attach the key to a Bendel which has other regular keys that are at least as significant, and the Bendel may then be put on and taken off, but without touching this actual key. [Although it would normally be ideal to remove Muktzah keys before Shabbos, this is not a requirement.]
Asking a Goy to open the door for you, would be permitted, being that it is a Psik Reisha. Also, it is a Shevus Dshevus in a case of reasonably great need.

I live in an apartment building, and the only way to get it in is through an electronic door…###question 
  Am I allowed to eat in a married woman’s kitchen if she does not cover her hair?.
 ###answer 
 This depends on various factors. Firstly, do you know if she keeps the basic kosher standards that are not necessarily kept by all kosher consumers such as: Cholov Yisrael and Pas Yisrael, etc..? In other words, what is her official standards?
Is she knowledgeable and active in checking salads for bugs? Does she check eggs for blood spots? Does she understand that there are many hechsherim and not all of them are acceptable to Anash?
If it seems to you that her knowledge seems adequate to run a kosher kitchen to your liking, then we need to consider the second question: can you rely on her Yiras Shamayim due to the fact that she does not cover her hair?
This would depend on her upbringing. For example, if she is only starting to become frum the reason for not covering her hair might be because she knows that many Orthodox women do not cover their hair and she considers herself like one of them, (of course this is wrong, but it is her nisayon – challenge). If so, it could be acceptable to eat in her home if otherwise, her Yiras shamayim seems to be good in all other aspects.
If, however, she has had a frum upbringing and now does not cover her hair, then this is a negative reflection on her yiras shamayim. This is since there is no true justified reason she can have that she is not covering her hair.
Therefore, the matter would depend on your kosher standards and the specifics of some of the above-mentioned points to consider.###question 
 I live in an apartment building, and the only way to get it in is through an electronic door. I normally wait for a car to drive through the garage door and follow it. Today, I walked up to the garage door and it opened, and there was no car around. I suspect that my non-Jewish neighbor saw me waiting for a passing car and did me a favor and opened the garage door through his remote control. Am I allowed to walk in?.
 ###answer 
 
In general, one may not benefit from a Melacha that a Goy has performed for him on Shabbos.
But in this case, being that it is a Psik Reisha, it would be permitted even to ask a Goy to open the door for you.###question

 There is no halachic objection to go horseback riding in the nine days, particularly with regards to children. Obviously, safety precautions are important at all times, and especially during these days.
It’s important however that the trips are done with less fanfare and excitement, so as to distinguish somewhat between these trips and other trips.###question

 I have a Sefer Torah in Chabad house in a portable dresser/closet. What is the minhag in general regarding how many coverings and how to cover it? Right now it is just in the dresser (it’s the only thing in the dresser). There’s no paroches. Should I put a talis on the entire dresser, should I just cover the Torah itself inside with a talis? Or is it ok to just leave it the way it is, because either way no one is living permanently in the Chabad house?
If you can tell me if there’s a specific minhag, even if there’s no halachic necessity to do it that way, that’s good too..
 ###answer 
 
The custom is to have a curtain always covering the Aron Kodesh’s door. This is not only to beautify the Aron Kodesh but a sign of modesty. This is based on the verse (Terumah 26:33) “… The partition shall separate for you between the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies.” An additional reason is that the curtains are a cover over the aron, as was done in the midbar that the Klei Hakodesh (holy vessels) were covered. (See Bamidbar 4: 5 onwards).

The Zereh Emes clearly writes that even if the curtain is not as nice as the Aron Kodesh, one still should cover it from the outside.

 ###answer 
 Yes.###question 
  Can an electric cooktop be used on Yom Tov?.
 ###answer 
 
On Shabbos, we are forbidden from raising/lowering a fire. Chazal said that one must cover the fire – and according to some poskim, the knobs too – in case one might forget and raise the fire over Shabbos.
On Yom Tov however we are permitted to raise a (real, not electric) fire, but we may not extinguish it or lower it, and therefore this halacha does not apply for Yom Tov. However, it is still forbidden to actually raise/lower an electric appliance.
Therefore you may use an electric appliance without worry about the knobs/buttons, just make sure not to actually use the knobs/buttons.###question

  What is the minimum of Challah one can eat and still be able to wash & Bentch?
I try to keep the minhag of melave malka every week, including washing. Sometimes it’s hard to eat a lot after having eaten recently at the Shabbos meal…
What is the minimum of challah/Matzah one can eat and still be able to wash/bentch?
Over the years I’ve seen many different places where there is a weight amount or, worse yet, a description such as “kazayis” or “kabeitza” to describe food shiurim, and those leave a person very confused as to the exact amount of food. Would the Rav be so kind as to describe the size of a piece of challah or the amount of matzah (usually box Square Matzah)? (E.g. The amount of challah comparable to a golf ball or two golf balls etc or a different item that the challah could be measured against).
Additionally, does the shiur consist of only the hamotzi food, or could something that’s put on top of the challah/matzah also count as part of the shiur? (Let’s say if someone puts egg salad or tuna salad on challah, can this be counted and this way one eats let’s of the actual hamotzi food but can nevertheless still wash and bench).
And finally, is there a time frame in which one needs to eat the shiur?.
 ###answer 
 
One must wash (without a Bracha) and make Hamotzi for even the smallest amount.
One must wash with a Bracha if he’s planning on eating a K’beitza. This is approximately 2 K’zeizim. Each K’zayis should be eaten within K’dei Achilas Pras (= 4 minutes) and without pausing between the two of them.
One must make a Birchas Hamazon if he ate a K’zayis of bread within 4 minutes. Other foods do not count for this amount.
If 4 minutes proves to be too difficult, one can be lenient and eat it within 6 minutes but should eat approximately the size of 1/3 of a K’beitza within 4 minutes. If one is not sure if it was eaten in the right amount of time – if he is satiated, he should still make a Birchas Hamazon.
Torah measurements are usually volume-based, not weight. A K’zayis is the approximate volume of half an average size egg. A K’beizah is the volume of an average size egg. Nonetheless, for simplicity, they have been converted to weight measurements, although the weight measurements are far from accurate. This is because different foods with an equal volume weigh differently. The following is the weight for water; bread and certainly matzah weighs less. For a K’beitza this is approx. 53.8 gram or 1.89 oz. For a K’zayis, approx. 25.6 gram or 0.90 oz.
One-third of a standard square machine matza is approximately a K’zayis. With bread, it is harder to measure, as they are not uniform but it is approximately the size of what would fit into a small l’chaim cup. In order to be safe, one should err on the side of caution and eat slightly more than the shiur, due to a number of reasons, among them since some crumbs remain between the teeth.

  Are Potato Chips/Pringles with an OU Fine?.
 ###answer 
 Potato chips – fried potato chips should be Bishul Yisroel. However steam cooked potato chips do not need to be exclusively bishul Yisroel.
Pringles – there is a Machlokes in regards to regular Potato chips if they need to be Bishul Yisroel and one should be stringent as mentioned, however, even according to the lenient opinion, there is room to be more stringent in regards to pringles.
Reasoning:
Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh Deah 113:1) requires Bishul Yisroel only on foods that are Oleh Al Shulchan Melachim (that would be served at the meals of royalty).
The Chachmas Adom 66:4 writes that foods like potato cuttings require to be Bishul Yisroel.
Although most opinions maintain that we define Oleh al Shulchan Melachim solely by the fact how it is served right now (if it is fit for a meal of royalty), since a fried potato would require to be bishul Yisroel, the potato chip should also be bishul Yisroel,
despite the fact that it is cut thin.
This would be analogous to a piece of meat: one cannot say that only certain cuts of meat that are fancy require Bishul Yisroel and non-fancy cuts of meat do not require Bishul Yisroel.
However If the potato chips are steam cooked, it does not require to be bishul Yisroel (see Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 113:13).
Pringles made from potato starch or potato flour – if the potato was cooked first it would have needed to be bishul Yisroel before it was turned into potato starch.
Therefore, Pringles are different than potato chips since during the process they were already cooked like regular potatoes even though they are dried afterward. Thus, it is problematic even for those who would argue that potato chips are fine, since the original Issur when it was cooked by a non-Jew remains. (Those who allow it use certain leniencies and some claim it’s better than potato chips.)

  Does one need to ask a Rav before being induced? Is there any Halachic issue?.
 ###answer 
 
This matter is discussed in a number of Poskim. The general rule is that one may not induce or rush the onset of labor unless there are clear medical reasons to require it. Some of the reasons for this prohibition are because:
There is a level of risk inherent to childbirth, and one should therefore not hasten it even though it is bound to come.
The special assurance of protection Hashem provides at the time of childbirth does not necessarily apply to the same degree if the birth is hastened without a clear medical need.
The procedures and/or medicines involved in induction can themselves cause complications, and one should not take that risk needlessly.###question 
 As things look, it seems we may need to be making Pesach at home this year. Since Mikvaos are closed, how can we go about doing tevilas kelim for the new utensils we buy?.
 ###answer 
 
For the time being, if there are no places available to tovel keilim, one can give to a non Jew and then borrow it from them. This exempts the dishes from tevilah for the time being. This is not a solution long-term. After such time that it becomes possible to immerse the dishes, one should do so without a blessing.

There is no such an obligation to read the Torah on a Friday afternoon, similarly there is no need to do it with a Kosher Sefer Torah.

 ###answer 
 
Thank you for contacting AskTheRav. We have received your question.
Please note that AskTheRav receives many questions from our visitors every day. We strive to answer these matters of practical Halacha in an efficient manner. Therefore, we ask our visitors to limit their questions to those of practical Halachic nature rather than learning style research questions, so that we can spend our time serving you best with your Halachic questions.
Regarding your question: The Chabad position re Zionism is very nuanced. An excellent summary can be found here, and here.
Regarding the usage of Ivrit, see here 
Regarding taking control of the mountain, Jews have complete control over that area. As for an obligation to build the Beis Hamikdosh on Temple Mount, this is actually one thing where the Rebbe was very clear on this matter. The same as virtually all gedolei Yisroel, the Rebbe was firmly opposed to any such talk and maintained that Geulah can only come about through Moshiach, and he is the one who is to instruct on building the Beis Hamikdosh.

  Is it permissible to bury remains of a body that was cremated?
A man died in another country of natural causes. The caregiver had the body cremated (due to issues of cross-border transportation during these times). This man had previously purchased a grave in this country beside his previously deceased wife.
Is it permissible to bury remains (eventually) in a previously purchased grave?.
 ###answer 
 
In this case, the remains should be buried in a Jewish cemetary. This is because the niftar and the family did not choose cremation, rather it was done against their will.

  NJ governor just allowed drive-in gatherings as long as everyone stays in their cars and are 6 feet from the next car. Accordingly, is there any way to make a kosher minyan while staying in cars?.
 ###answer 
 If the people in the cars can see each other (or at least the chazzan can) they can be combined as 10 people for a minyan, provided no public thoroughfare separates between them.
The car window is must remain open, so there is no actual mechitzah between them.

  Is a toy frog “Kosher”, since it’s one of the ?
This may be more of a “chassidishe rov” question than a pure halacha question, but I would still be happy to hear your thoughts.
My wife and I are careful to minimize our son’s exposure to non-kosher animals, based on what we understand to be the Rebbe’s instructions, although I have never seen the sources myself. Recently, though, we wanted to get him a lot of new toys, and one thing I bought him was a toy frog, which I assumed was fine since it’s one of the . He really likes it, so he still plays with it even now, but we started wondering if maybe it was a mistake to give it to him since it’s not kosher. Should we let him keep it, or work on distracting him from it and giving him something else instead?
By the way, if you know offhand where the Rebbe discusses this whole topic, I would love to know the sources. We seem to have questions about it come up a lot, especially when visiting not-frum relatives..
 ###answer 
 
You should try to de-attach him from this toy as you suggested – slowly but surely.

  Is it Tznius for over Bas Mitzvah girls to daven in a place like Prospect Park?
Is it tznius for over Bas Mitzvah girls to daven in a place like Prospect Park (not while on the go, specifically going to park to daven there)? Is that considered in a “public place”?.
 ###answer 
 
There are 2 points to consider:
1. One should not daven in an open area (like a field) unless they are traveling (see Alter Rebbe Shulchan Aruch 90:5).
2. While it’s not a lack of tznius for a girl or woman to daven in a public place – see here – it wouldn’t be appropriate to schedule a public event for girls and women in a public place if that activity will attract attention to them.###question

  Can a few women split the daily Chitas between themselves?
Is it ok and considered fulfilled to split chitas of the day with more than one person. I so badly want to fulfill the Rebbes Hora’ah especially with everything that’s going on in the world and to bring Moshiach. But chitas is too long for me to actually do while raising my kids etc. I had in mind to make a WhatsApp group to divide it between other women. Would that be considered fulfilling the chitas?.
 ###answer 
 
The takana to learn chitas is on an individual basis, where everyone will finish the Chumash and Tanya throughout the year. And the Tehillim on a monthly basis.
Splitting up the chitas is not the ideal method, since you as an individual will not have completed the above. There is however some merit in it, since you, as part of a group, will have it completed (similar to the division of Shas has done on 19 Kislev, although as noted, this was not the original takana of chitas).
I suggest that in addition to splitting it among your friends, you also try to learn just the Chumash without Rashi, or to cover a certain amount throughout the day and complete the rest at a later point.The same can be with Tehilim (first kapital) and Tanya.###question 
 It’s known that a man should not say hello to a woman. What if she said hello to me, what do I do? And is a man allowed to say hello to his niece and sister in-law?.
 ###answer 
 
In a place where the custom is to say hello to a women, it is commendable to say hello as well as reply to greetings, as this is not a greeting that contains any promiscuity, or affection, and on the contrary may result in a desecration of G-d’s name.
In a place where it’s not the custom, its prohibited to say hello, as this is a portrayal of affection, replying should be respectful and curt.
To family members (sister-in-law, niece) one may say hello, and speak work related speech only, and minimizing small talk as this leads to issues.

  Can a girl work in the younger division of a boys camp?
I work as an assistant director of a BOYS day camp.
We have campers age 6-12 and counselors aged 13-20.
We have a “kiddies” bunk in camp, with an older married woman as the main “morah”, there is the option to have a 18 year old girl as the helper for that bunk.
They would be in a totally separate classroom, doing their own activities. They would only eat in the lunchroom at the same time (separate table of course) share the bus during trips (sitting separately in the back or front), and some few activities.
Is there an issue having an unmarried girl in camp?.
 ###answer 
 
Absolutely unacceptable. Even with married staff, there are concerns, certainly with teenagers. It is obvious that single boys and girls working together will undoubtedly lead to a sub-conscious laxity in tznius, and can extend even outside the workspace as they get more comfortable with each other, or in general, they can become comfortable with the opposite gender – a breach of the wall of tznius that exists in our society where boys/girls are kept separate. Often the staff will need to be in contact regarding different matters (transportation, trips, deliveries, etc.) that will require direct communication via cell phone, with its consequences.
I would rather not elaborate on such a topic, but many issues have arisen from such camps, with many having long-term effects. (I want to add that putting boys/girls in this situation with these challenges is a severe violation of Lifnei Iver, and very unfair to them, especially if they are/were unaware. Some counselors will be too embarrassed to speak up about it although the situation is difficult for them or they know it’s wrong).
This is even if what you describe is true and your intentions are pure, nevertheless, we daven every day   . .   and are warned      . However, practically we know what actually happens, ”. And If we are dealing with a mossad of chinuch which endeavors to instill in the children proper chassidish values, the responsibility is greater.
This touches on multiple prohibitions which are practically impossible to prevent, including but not limited to:
Needless chatter (inevitable) – other than a polite hello when needed:

  Can the husband be in the delivery room, especially if there is no doula present?
I am a doctor. I have seen from personal experience that people get better care if they are not alone in the hospital. Especially sometimes if the woman is alone during birth, she may be pressured to do a procedure to save a doctor or other provider time which is not necessary and can lead to negative health outcomes for herself or the newborn baby..
 ###answer 
 
According to halacha, there are serious concerns with the husband being present in the delivery room. Even where a potential heter can be found, the Rebbe spoke strongly against this practice and stated that it is considered a breach of modesty. The Rebbe commented that at the time of birth one should seek out extra z’chusim and certainly not add in matters which are the opposite of z’chus.
That being said, if there is a concern of danger or if the woman is actually scared (and not just because she wants it or because others are doing it…)  and there is no one else to assist, you may help and do as she needs. You should preferably wear gloves to minimize contact and face the other direction.###question

Indeed, the Rebbe added the word  and removed the word , and this is the custom to write in such a way when used as one of the 12 Pesukim, but not in Tanya.
Nonetheless, at all of the rallies in the presence of the Rebbe they said the lashon as it is written it Tanya, i.e. without  and with the word .###question 
  Does a woman within 24 months of birth need to fast if she stopped nursing?.
 ###answer 
 Her status is considered as any other woman, as being in the 24 months of giving birth is not sufficient reason enough for exempting her from fasting.
Although the Maharsha”m states that women should not have to fast for twenty four months after giving birth, his Pesak is not accepted by the mainstream Poskim.

 I know we don’t cut on Thursday, but is Wednesday night included too? Because the day starts from the night before.
Also, it there an inyan not to cut at nights (any other night)?.
 ###answer 
 
Nails shouldn’t be cut on Wednesday night – like Thursday.
Regarding nights in general –
May I cut my hair and nails after chatzos (midday)?
Sifrei Kabbalah (Holy writings of Kabbalah) relate that the Arizal would refrain from having his hair cut after midday. Some are of the opinion that the same would apply to cutting nails. The question is: what was the reason for this custom?
If it was because we shouldn’t engage in any new melachah (work) once the zman (time) of Mincha has arrived—lest we be distracted from davening Mincha—then we can assume that there is no issue with cutting our hair after having davened Mincha. Nails, however, may be cut even before davening Mincha.
However, if the reason was that according to Kabbalah the forces of dinim (Heavenly judgment) begin gaining strength after midday, it would be cause to refrain from doing so throughout the entire afternoon, and in fact more so at night, when the dinim are even more severe. Although the influence of the forces of dinim is mentioned specifically only regarding haircuts, it can arguably be applied to nail cutting too.
Common practice, though, is that we do take haircuts and cut our nails after midday—provided that we have davened Mincha—and at night as well. Likewise, If one has a fixed minyan for davening Mincha, one need not refrain from engaging in melacha prior to davening.###question 
  How important is it for the Bris Seuda to be Fleishik?.
 ###answer 
 Fleishig should be served if possible. This applies to any seudas mitzvah, especially a Bris.
There are also sources which attribute special segulos the fleishig meal has upon the child.###question 
 I also wanted to post this work on a website to make it available to all teachers. I contacted the publisher to ask permission and he said no (not even for pay). He said I can’t even copy it for my own classroom use. Is he entitled to make these restrictions 1) for my classroom use 2) for publicity on the website (both not for money)?.
 ###answer 
 
The concept of ownership over intellectual property is debated in the Poskim and the general consensus is that when a publisher puts out a new book or invention, he has the right to it forever and no one may reproduce it without his permission. Many different reasons are offered to explain this halachic concept. The secular copyright laws can also apply, .
In the case of the illustrations particularly, since it’s not Torah thoughts but illustrations there is more reason to prohibit reproduction. Certainly, the publisher has the right to restrict others from using them without permission. Even for classroom usage one would need their permission.###question

  If a child has a dirty diaper is there an issue of me davening or saying Hashem’s name within 4 Amos?.
 ###answer 
 If the child is of age that he can eat a kezayis of grain within the amount of time that it takes an adult to eat a pras of grain (approx. 7 minutes), usually at the age of one year and older (but often even younger), one must keep a distance from his urine and excrements.
The distance is 4 Amos from where the smell finishes, and they may not have it in their vision line when davening even if it’s more than 4 Amos away.
Nonetheless, it’s good and proper to daven in a clean place, even from excrements (not urine) of a one-day-old child, if it’s easy to do so, although it’s not forbidden.
If the excrement is inside a pamper, one may daven nearby, provided there is no foul odor. Likewise, one may daven near urine in a pamper, if it’s not wet to the touch on the outside, to the extent that anything touching it could cause wetness to another item.
Some are stringent that if one is aware that the pamper is dirty with excrement — not if it only contains urine— they must treat the pamper like a toilet bowl, and keep a distance of 4 Amos, even if there is no smell and may not have it in their vision line when davening even if its more than 4 Amos away. If the pamper is covered with another garment, one may daven nearby, if there is no smell.###question

  Which Bracha do we say on packaged apple sauce?.
 ###answer 
 The Bracha for applesauce is Ha’etz. However, if it’s pureed and has no recognizable pieces of fruit, such as commercial applesauce, there is a Machlokes as to its Bracha—and therefore the Halacha is that one should recite Shehakol. There is a tradition that the Rebbe Rayatz recited Ha’etz on applesauce. However, its not clear whether this was totally pureed or not. Likewise, in the Brachos guide reviewed by Rav Marlow A”H it says that applesauce is Ha’etz. To avoid any issue, it is recommended that one should recite Ha’etz on a piece of fruit first.###question 
  Is mother’s milk considered Pareve, Milchig or Fleishig?.
 ###answer 
 Q. Must I wash bottles or dishes of breast milk with its own sponge?
A. Mother’s milk is considered Pareve. However, we give it the status of Milchig because of Maris Ayin (that people might not know that this is breast milk and think that it’s regular milk).
Therefore, ideally, you should wash pumps and dishes in Milchig or Pareve, but not with Fleishig. If it was washed by mistake in Fleishig, it is still Kosher.
Q. I only have a fleishig dishwasher, can I put a breast milk bottle in it?
A. Lechatchila you shouldn’t do it. However, if it is rinsed first you may put it there.###question

  Do apricots or honey need a Hechsher?.
 ###answer 
 Honey:
Raw unflavored honey which is 100% pure and filtered may be used without a Hechsher. However, retail size honey often goes through heating which can be a problem when using shared equipment. It is therefore recommended to purchase honey only with a Hechsher. One must ensure that no other ingredients are added like alcohol and sweeteners. Additionally, the honey needs to be filtered very well from any pieces of the bees that can get mixed in it.
Apricots:
Fresh apricots do not require a Hechsher unless they are from Eretz Yisroel. Even dried apricots, if produced out of Eretz Yisroel (usually they are made in Turkey), do not require a Hechsher, provided they are unflavored, and without additives, since no other ingredients go in the drying process. Sulfur dioxide added is not a concern. However, some apricot companies season their apricots with flavoring to give their apricots a unique taste. Therefore, to be on the safer side it is best to buy only with a Hechsher as food processing is always changing. One must certainly ensure the apricots are insect free. They must be checked appropriately.###question 
  What is the Rebbe’s Minhag in how many Haddasim to use?.
 ###answer 
 It is the Chabad custom to add multiple Haddasim to the standard three, adding at least another three. The greater the number of additional Haddasim, the better.
In Sefer HaMinhagim page 65 it says: 4, 12, 13 or 26 but not 9, 68 or 69.
The Rebbe’s personal custom is to take 36 since 5741. (In 5711 – 13; from 5712 till 5740 – 26).
Q. Is there a specific reason why Chassidim shouldn’t use that amount? 
A. I don’t see any reason to use or not to use the same amount the Rebbe does.
It should be noted that unlike other customs, in this specific matter, the Rebbeim give specific guidance to different individuals how much they should take. Also, the Rebbe himself changed the amount after the nesius. Same with the Rebbe Rayatz.
Whatever amount one uses is okay so long as one can afford it and it does not come on expense of Simchas Yom Tov of the family.

SimilarQuestion:
Can one make a sukkah by removing T tops and placing a mat on top, into a kosher albeit, temporary sukkah? Both sides of the roof would be off, but there is a .5 foot separation running down the middle..

A few introductions:
A Sukkah has to:
be (and have walls that are) at least 32 inches tall and have width of at least 22.4 inches by 22.4 inches;
have at least 3 walls;
be a place where you are comfortable to eat, drink, spend time and sleep.
In this case:
A. the Schach would have to be covering a (uninterrupted) space that is 32″ tall and 22.4″ by 22.4″ (the seats would be considered an interruption);
B. the car (which is being used as walls) cannot be more than 9.48″ off the ground and the sides have to be directly under the Schach, and have above height;

In conclusion, unless you meet all the above requirements, it cannot be done.
See also the following excerpts from our Day to Day Halachic Guide:
MOBILE SUKKAH
A person who is traveling without access to a Sukkah, can create a Sukkah out of a vehicle (or two), as follows:
LOCATION
The spot you choose should be semi-secluded, and not on a public path where it would interfere with foot traffic. It should also be a safe, crime-free area, where you would technically be able to sleep at night. It should also fulfill the other requirements for the positioning of a Sukkah – the area above the s’chach free of tree limbs or overhangs
ASSEMBLY
Use the front and back door of a single vehicle (on the same side) or open a single door on mirroring sides of two vehicles. (The interior of a convertible or roadster that fits all the dimensions below can be used as well.)
The area created by the three sides (either the two doors and the one car body, or the two car bodies and the adjacent doors) has to be at least seven tefachim long and seven tefachim wide (about 22.5 inches on each side).
The doors must reach ten tefachim (3.25 feet) in height and start no more than three tefachim (9.5 inches) off the ground. Parking near a curb and opening the door(s) over the curb will help in this regard.
The doors must be fully and firmly open, so that a gust of wind will not slam them closed.
ROOF
It is preferable not to prop the s’chach directly on the car doors, but to first place wood laths or the like across and the s’chach on top of that. The s’chach should be fixed to the “roof” with jute twine or string (not zip ties) so that it will not blow away.
The above is set up in such a way that the “walls” of the Sukkah are adjacently perpendicular to the s’chach. If there is an area of four amos (six feet) of car roof on any side of the Sukkah or four tefachim (13 inches) of car roof or other unkosher covering in the middle of the Sukkah, it is unusable.115 If the mobile Sukkah is of the smallest possible size (seven by seven tefachim), any three-tefach span of car roof – whether in the middle or on the side – will invalidate it.
USE
You must hold your food or put it down on a table or surface inside your makeshift Sukkah. You may not eat under the s’chach and use the seat in the car (outside your Sukkah) as your table.
You must stipulate that the vehicle(s) will be able to be used for (non-holy) purposes after the Sukkah is dismantled, since, as stated above, we are usually not allowed to use the parts of a Sukkah for another purpose once they were used for a mitzvah.###question

The Rebbe continued in his response to point out the halachic references for this opinion.###question 
  My husband is in Aveilus. Can we play music at our son’s Upsherin, even though he and his siblings are in attendance? Do they each serve something to someone?.
 ###answer 
 
You may have music. The Aveilim R’”L should not pay attention to the music. Certainly, not to join any dancing.
Yes, each one of the Aveilim should be doing some serving.
Also, if there will be a full meal, they should not eat the meal there (Hamotzi etc.). They may taste/eat a little, (or they can eat meal in another room).###question 
 Is there an exception to that “rule”, like when auspicious days fall out on Shabbos? (i.e. are we supposed to go ahead and ask anyway?).
 ###answer 
 
According to Halacha one may not request their needs on Shabbos.
One of the reasons for this is because Shabbos accomplishes everything by itself without the need for us to resort to asking for it.  Even when Rosh Hashana or Yom Kippur – which are the most auspicious days of the year to request all of our needs – fall out on Shabbos we do not request our needs with Avinu Malkeinu.
You can make all your requests after Shabbos ends, especially regarding Yud Tes kislev which we celebrate the 20th of kislev as well.
Additionally, anything which is part of the standard text of davening is permitted. Thus, you may have your requests in mind in the Davening of Shabbos, especially during the sections of davening which we say on Shabbos for personal needs (which are permitted being that they are part of the Nussch which the Chachomim instituted) like Yehi Rotzon in the morning Berochos, the middle Beracha of Shabbos Shemone Esrei, Eloki Netzor at the end of Shemone Esrei, Brich Shmei when the Aron Hakodesh is opened and Yekum Purkan and Mi Shebeirach before Musaf. It is important that we have extra kavana when reciting these tefillos. This is more preferred over any personal prayers.
As well, requests for a Refuah Shleima of critically sick person or spiritual requests are permitted on Shabbos. However we do not confess our sins on Shabbos.
We must use out these auspicious days especially when they fall out on Shabbos for extra Davening, learning, Farbrengen and undertaking good resolutions.###question

  May I press snow with my foot while walking on Shabbos?.
 ###answer 
 If it will for sure cause the snow to melt (for example if your shoes are already wet), it’s preferable to take a different route or to hop over or walk around if easily possible. Otherwise it would not be an issue. However, just to press down the snow by itself while not walking would not be allowed.###question 
  Can sticky notes (like post-it’s) be used on Shabbos to mark a place in a book?.
 ###answer 
 You may place them and remove them if it’s meant to remain there less than a day. If it will stay longer, one should ideally be stringent.
Regarding taking one off its stack (if they are stuck together):
It should be removed for the first time before Shabbos, and then it can be reattached as needed.

  How much does one have to clean after the bathroom?
How far does one have to check after the bathroom to be concerned about these issues brought in shulchan Aruch? For some, being overly concerned can at times cause fissures and bleeding, which can be an issue on Shabbos, and which can cause medical problems in the long term..
 ###answer 
 
Even though one should Lechatchila clean until a tissue would come out clean, one should definitely not stress about this and clean to the point where damage may be inflicted. Additionally, when using water or a bidet one can be lenient about the wiping. (And there’s definitely no room for cleaning inside the anus which has no basis in Halacha.)###question 
 Does the car service need to be Jewish? Frum?
Note: usually, the taxi gets paid at the time he drops off the food.
Also, one of the non-Jewish kitchen workers rids over to the other location with his bicycle. He brought me a tuna sandwich from the kitchen – and it’s not double ‘sealed’. (it’s double-wrapped (saran wrap + silver foil. No tape or special siman), can it be eaten or not?.
 ###answer 
 
If it’s a set driver every time that would be afraid to lose his job if he gets caught one may be lenient.
If it’s not a set driver, he needs to be a yid who is careful with eating kosher (he does not need to be shomer shabbos in regards to this halacha). If not, then there would be an issue also with fish and milchigs if it’s not sealed properly.
A siman has to be a significant sign that indicates that there is no chance of it being switched like a stamp and/or a seal. If one could recognize the food and knows for sure where it comes from is also fine.
When riding a bicycle through reshus horabim one may be lenient after the fact, unless it’s a frum neighborhood then it shouldn’t be a problem at all.###question 
 Q1. For heartburn/acid reflux, may one chew Tums with letters on Shabbos? If not, what should one do?.
 ###answer 
 A. Swallowing pills with letters isn’t a problem. The issue is eating where it breaks before swallowing.
However, tums are a problem due to taking medication on Shabbos. It is permissible if either of the following conditions exists:
If one takes it before the onset of heartburn. Likewise, if taken for its nutritional value, as a calcium supplement, rather than to cure existing heartburn, there is room to be lenient.
If one is bedridden or his pain causes a sickness/ weakness in the entire body (such as severe pain where one cannot function).
If one has no choice as all foods cause heartburn.
If mixed into food before Shabbos.
Q2: What if the pain prevents sleep, or is really disturbing in general, may one take tums then?
A. Tzaar Gadol, strong pain, isn’t a license to take medications unless it causes one to be bedridden or general weakness in the entire body.
In such situations, it is recommended to mix the medication into food before Shabbos, as mentioned.
Q3. Is it the same with Yom Tov?
A. Yes, but second day Yom Tov it’s OK and there is no problem of Refuah (or the letters breaking).###question 
  How should I light Shabbos candles in a hospital?.
 ###answer 
 One may light electric candles in the hospital with a Bracha. It is recommended to use a battery operated light, rather than a regular electric lamp. Some say the light must be incandescent and not fluorescent. One should certainly not use LED lights.
Ideally it should be a light not ordinarily used during the week.###question 
  Can I use a sock to strain the tap water on Shabbos?
Many have a custom to keep a sock on their tap over Pesach, to make sure that no Chametz will come out of the tap, What should we do on Shabbos or Yom Tov?
I could think of two possible concerns:
1. The sock is clean, but the sock dries overnight and the water coming out of the tap is clean. Would this be an issue of Melaben?
2. It’s true that practically there Is no chance of actual Chametz coming out of the tap, but would we still have to be Choshesh for Borer?.
 ###answer 
 
It is best to use a strainer/filter manufactured especially for this purpose (sold in most Jewish stores that sell Pesach items).
If it is not attainable, you may use another type of cloth that you set aside for that, best if it is a white cloth.
P.S. A sock might not be the best idea, for practical reasons.###question

 So how can venting be done in a correct way?.
 ###answer 
 
If necessary, one may vent about an insult etc. and include the person’s name, provided one meets the following conditions:
1. The objective is only to vent so that you feel better and nothing else. The venting is what makes makes you feel better and not putting someone else down.
2. Speaking directly to the person who insulted you etc. would not be productive.
3. You do not have any other options to make yourself feel better.
4. You are talking about something that you experienced directly and not that you heard from someone else.
5. Before talking to someone else you must first reexamine the scenario calmly to determine if you are truly in the right and the other person’s action was unwarranted etc.
6. You may only tell one person.
7. There won’t be a significant negative fallout to the person who insulted you.
8. You may not exaggerate and you may not leave out details that would show the other side in a more positive light.###question

Could there be a cheshash of shtorai hedyotos?.
 ###answer 
 
Not a problem mitzad Halacha, although it may not be in the spirit of Shabbos depending on the circumstances.###question 
 Is there an inyan to leave the Shabbos tablecloth on Motzaei Shabbos? My wife wants the house to be cleaned and she prefers the (fresh) weekday tablecloth, but I always feel a little uncomfortable taking off the Shabbos one so soon. (Is it like Shabbos clothes?).
 ###answer 
 
Preferably, one should remove the Shabbos tablecloth after Havdalah and then place a new one for Melave Malka. This new one should be respectable. It’s questionable whether one should ideally avoid using a tablecloth that is ordinarily used for weekday meals.
Many, however, are accustomed to leave the Shabbos tablecloth on for the Melave Malka. This is okay as long as some type of act of preparing the table for the Melava Malka has been done.
Both approaches are acceptable, as long as one’s ultimate intention is to increase the honor of Shabbos.
Of course, one can choose to accommodate both approaches, by putting on a new plastic for the Melave Malka tablecloth on top of the Shabbos linen cloth (even if he doesn’t usually use a plastic on Shabbos).
In your specific case, I’d recommend doing the way your wife desires, for Shalom Bayis purposes.###question 
  Is it OK for me to attend a workshop/state training that is being held in a room in an Islamic school building?.

  Is there any problem with piercing a bag of juice to drink with a straw (e.g. Capri Sun) on Shabbos?.
 ###answer 
 There is an argument amongst contemporary poskim if one is allowed to open it on Shabbos.
In practice, one should open it before Shabbos. If one forgot to do so, there is room for leniency to do it on Shabbos. However, even then it is best to cut or rip the entire top of the carton and avoid the issue.
See here for similar topic:

  Can I make the Bracha when installing a Ma’ake/fence?
We are renovating our home and we move the stairs to a different place. Now there is an area upstairs which we need to put a fence on. The open area at some point is about 8 feet from the floor underneath it. Can I make the Bracha when installing the fence?.
 ###answer 
 
On the side of the steps, no Bracha is needed. Above the steps, if it’s in the house, the walking area is wider than 4x 4 Amos, and the fall is ten tefachim, a Bracha is recited if you put up the fence, or a Jewish worker does so.
A Shehechiyanu isn’t recited. If you wish, however, you can purchase a new garment or fruit and when reciting Shechayanu over it have in mind the mitzvah of the fence too.###question 
  Am I allowed to open and close the radiator knob in my apartment?
I do not control the heat. The heat is turned off and on in the whole building and since the thermostat is not on my apartment, it doesn’t go on and off depending on the temperature by me.
I can only open or close the radiator in my apartment which will allow the heat, which is already on and heating apartments below & on top of me, to flow (or to not flow) into the radiator that is in my apartment.
Am I allowed to open and close the radiator knob in my apartment?.
 ###answer 
 
On Shabbos, it is forbidden to turn on the taps of the radiator as this causes the cold water in the radiator to flow into the boiler, where it would be heated.
You cannot turn on the taps even if the heating system is not yet operating but will be turned on during Shabbos.
It is permissible to turn off the taps of the radiator on Shabbos, however it is proper to refrain from doing so as long as the water inside the radiator is in the process of being heated and has not yet reached a temperature of 113 degrees Fahrenheit (45 degrees Celsius).
This is because turning off the taps causes the water in the boiler to reach a temperature of 113 degrees Fahrenheit more quickly than it otherwise would.
On Yom Tov there is a different Halacha.

However, we did bring a Chitas and a pushka into the kitchen right away. Should we/do we need to put up mezuzos on the house?.

  How often can I make the Bracha on a rainbow?
Recently I had the opportunity to make the Bracha on seeing a rainbow. Surprisingly enough, the same thing happened the next day. I vaguely recall learning that this Bracha is made only once in thirty days. Searched kitzur and Alter Rebbe’s Shulchan Aruch; could not find such a thing. Is there such a tradition?.
 ###answer 
 
On the contrary, you would make even within 30 days as it’s a different rainbow. This is unlike other similar brachos (like on mountains, rivers and shooting stars, etc.) that the sight is the same, and therefore the Bracha is on the first time seeing, and in some cases every 30 days.###question 
  Can we purchase and give a gift during the nine days?
We need to thank someone who extended great kindness to us. Is it permissible to purchase and give a gift (silver or similar type gift) during the nine days?.
 ###answer 
 
Gifts may be given in the nine days, but not on Tisha B’av. If it’s a very expensive gift, some suggest that it should not be purchased in the nine days and should only be bought after Tisha Beav.###question 
 Now, I understand that generally speaking, since they are obligated to learn Torah, their Torah learning expenses can’t be Ma’aser. So could their payment for my service be taken from Ma’aser?
If this is problematic, then my question is the following. Can we frame this halachically in the following manner: That the money that each client would be paying will be facilitating others to learn more. This is actually true, because with the money I will be able to expand my services, etc. With that framing/understanding, can the clients payment be considered Ma’aser?.
 ###answer 
 
Using Ma’aser for personal education is highly debatable. As this is not part of the Chiyuv of Limud Hatorah, but a enhancement to the Mitzvah, there is room to allow to use Ma’aser money for this cause.###question 
  How long does a one year old baby need to wait between a meat meal and getting a Milchig bottle?.
 ###answer 
 For very young children and sick people, one can rely on the Minhag brought in the Remah to only wait one hour after meat. One should wash the child’s hands and try to give him something to eat and drink before giving him milk.
With regard to children that are under 2-3 years old, one may be lenient and not wait even an hour where necessary.###question 
  Is a Goy allowed to get a tattoo?.
 ###answer

 Are there parts he can skip? Is there an order of priority he can follow depending on how much he feels he can do that day? Can he say any parts skipped at a later time?.
 ###answer 
 
The Shulchan Aruch when discussing which parts of davening to skip when coming late to davening gives preference to certain parts of davening. Even though it is not our minhag to skip any parts of davening, in this situation one should follow that order. Here is the list in order of priority:
Shema and Shmeno Esrei
Birchos Hashachar
Birchos Krias Shema
Baruch She’amar, Ashrei and Yishtabach. (If they are not going to do at least Ashrei, they shouldn’t say Baruch She’amar and Yishtabach.)
The Hallelukahs. Preference is given to Halelu kel b’kodsho. Then, halelu Hashem min hashomayim. Then, the rest.
Mizmor L’sodah.
Vayevorech Dovid until Lshem Tifartecha.
Hodu untill Romemu Hashem Elokeinu.
Vayosha and Az Yoshir
The rest of Hodu and Yehi Chevod.
Mizmor Shir Chanukas, Hashem Melech, Lamnatzeiach Binginos
Then, add on as you are able.
If able to say the parts one skipped after davening, one should do so except for Baruch She’amar and Yishtabach.###question

I can’t drink tea, coffee, or take in any liquid including water after fasts as it makes me vomit. I am a woman, so I’m limited in choices about people making Havdala for me. I’m staying on my own, so no one was there to make havdala for me. Can I say havdala and have someone else to drink for me? Everyone was already yotzeh havdala. I am not able to drink anything or it will make me feel worse..
 ###answer 
 
If you can’t find anyone that was not yotze havdalah to drink the wine, coffee or tea, you shouldn’t make havdala.###question 
  Should I circle the Bima by Hosha’anos if I’m Davening without a Minyan?
If someone is Davening in a shul by themselves, should they take out the Sefer Torah for hoshaanos and put it on the Bima, or is it only taken out betzibur?.
 ###answer 
 
They shouldn’t take out the Sefer Torah but should circle the bimah.###question 
 What are the exact halachos of a woman or girl who is a niddah in regards to kissing a Sefer Torah or looking at an open scroll?
Is there anything that can practically be done to prevent these issues in cases like kissing the Rebbe’s Sefer Torah on Simchas Torah and Vzos HaTorah in shul?.
 ###answer 
 
Out of respect, women have adopted a custom not to look at an open Torah scroll or touch a Torah scroll when they are in the state of niddah. This isn’t strictly required halachically, but it’s a custom it has developed out of reverence for the Torah. This stringency is only observed while she is still menstruating (even though Halachically a woman is considered to be in a state of niddah until she immerses in the Mikvah).
This stringency applies even on Simchas Torah when many women and girls kiss the Torah scrolls. While some are particular for this reason not to bring the Torah scrolls into the women’s section, there is no halachic objection in doing so.
There’s really no need to do something if women and girls are kissing the Torah or looking at an open Torah scroll.###question 
 Is it acceptable to think words of Torah if you or someone else passed gas and there is an odor?
If one is not sure if there is still an odor, is there a general time frame that you can assume the smell has dissipated?.
 ###answer 
 
If you passed gas: To think words of Torah is allowed, but not to verbalize Torah.
If someone else passed gas: One may even speak Torah, but not Shema and davening.
If you don’t sense an odor it’s permitted always.###question 
  Is one allowed to give an Aliyah to someone who is married to a non-Jew R”L?.
 ###answer 
 As a general rule, they should not be given an Aliyah. This will also serve as a statement that doing such an aveira is worse than many other aveiros, and crosses a serious line.
In a pressing situation, where it may cause friction, there might be room for leniency to give them other Kibudim as Pesicha or the like.
If the individual is on his way up, becoming closer and closer to Yiddishkeit, and it’s believed that by giving him an aliya it could cement his relationship with Torah and Mitzvos, one should consider carefully the correct approach by discussing this with a rav.###question

  I attend a Sephardi shul that says Birkas Kohanim for shacharis every day and musaf. Should I say Ribono shel olam every time?.
 ###answer 
 The “Ribono Shel Olam” is recited during Birkas Kohanim, only on the day following a disturbing or worrying dream. Otherwise, it should be recited on Yom Tov (because we assume that everyone has had a disturbing dream during the long duration between one Yom Tov and the next).###question 
 Is this change reliable or should we stick with the nusach printed in all other siddurim?.
 ###answer 
 A. The nusach shouldn’t be changed.
Q. Does this also apply to a regular Mi sheberach lecholim (whether Shabbos or weekday), that one should say  ” ()   , or should that be switched to bli neder?
A. Should not be switched.
Q. And what if the gabbai himself is the one giving (so it’s his own neder) [And does he say his name or should he just say  ]?
A. He should say    , and he need not specify his name.###question 
 I am making Shir Lamaalos cards. In order that people not be Nichshal by bringing them into a bathroom with one covering, I would like to add a tiny film (a Ma’shehu) that makes it shinier. Would this tiny plastic film covering for the purposes of shininess help so that when people place it in their pocket, they have a situation of Kis B’toch Kis?.
 ###answer 
 
The definition of Keli B’toch Keli is that at least one Keli isn’t designed specifically for this holy item.
There is a disagreement how to interpret the concept of “not being designated”. In fact, some authorities allow preparing in advance two coverings with the intention of it being considered Keli B’toch Keli, even though both coverings were made for the holy item. This position can be explained as follows: the purpose of the Keli should not be for protection of the holy item, rather in order to permit those activities which need covering. Otherwise, it’s not a sufficient covering. However, the plain reading of the Halacha is that a cover which was designated in advance is never acceptable.
Nonetheless, there are many arguments to allow for leniency. Also, they will most likely be covered in one’s pocket which isn’t designated for them, thus at least one Keli isn’t designated for them. Even if not, at least they will be protected according to the Poskim who permit it.  Additionally, it should be pointed out that there are Poskim who maintain that one Keli is sufficient. See the analysis below.###question 
  What are the Halachos of Yichud when using Uber? .
 ###answer 
 Uber:
Almost all of the Halachos of driving a regular car apply to a taxi or Uber, i.e. one may travel when it is lit up and during the time when there are people in the street (on those streets), and the windows are not tinted in a way that someone can’t see into the car.(    ’  ” )
However, there are those that are Machmir and hold that wherever possible, one should not travel with a non-Jew or a ‘Parutz’ even by day  (     ’ ). With an Uber there is more room for leniency, as there are governing laws of the company for drivers, with GPS monitoring.
Parutz:
There is a Machlokes in Poskim how to define a Parutz. One must be especially careful in this regard when exposed to Yichud on a regular basis, such as in a workplace.
It is clear that a person who is not particular with the Issur of Kriva L’arayos and does not keep the guidelines of Tznius, even if he otherwise a Shomer Torah U’mitzvos, is  certainly considered  a Parutz. For example, a man who has no inhibitions about embracing women or girls, one who regularly watches television, reads unsuitable material, frequents indecent chat rooms on the internet, or visits movie theaters is considered a Parutz. The mere exposure to immodesty affects their morality. See Toras HaYichud 3:2:4. Shevet Halevi Vol. 5:202:1.
A man whose business dealings are questionable might be considered a Parutz in relation to Yichud — see Nitei Gavriel Yichud 22:9.
Furthermore, the average non-observant Jew is to be considered a Parutz too. The Tzemach Tzedek E”H 39 rules, that the definition of Anashim Ksheirim is one who has a special Chezkas Kashrus, such as a Talmid Chacham, and the standard Chezkas Kashrus of all Klal Yisroel isn’t sufficient. It seems that it need not be Mamosh a Talmid Chacham; it could be a Yeshiva Bachur etc., but it is not enough that we are not aware of any Pritzus behavior. See also Nitei Gavriel Yichud 19:3,10.

If I understand correctly from chapter 4 of “The Laws of Cooking on Shabbos” (by Rabbi Nissan Dovid Dubov, SIE) it can be placed on the blech on Shabbos. [“b) A dry kugel that may emit a small amount of oil may be reheated.”].
 ###answer 
 
This section in the book is addressing the laws of nolad, heating something up when some liquid dissolves, which applies even if below the temperature of yad soledes bo, the temperature which governs the laws of cooking on Shabbos. This is independent of the melacha of bishul, and the concern of mechzei kimvashel, the appearance of cooking.
True, there is no issue of nolad in the case of a kugel that emits a small amount of oil. However, there certainly is an issue of bishul. The only way one may reheat a kugel on Shabbos is if it’s absolutely dry to the touch, something highly unusual with ordinary fried kugel. Nonetheless, it still shouldn’t be placed directly on the blech on Shabbos, due to the issur of mechezei kimevashel, rather on top of a pot etc.###question 
  Is there an Inyan in saying Hallel with the Minyan?.
 ###answer 
 Yes.
One should make an extra effort to be holding with the Minyan for Hallel. The Rebbe once told someone who was accustomed to daven be’arichus that he should begin prior to the Minayn so that when they reach Hallel he should be holding with them. Similarly, the Rebbe writes in Igros Kodesh: ”Despite the fact that our Rebbeim would extend their Shabbos prayers over many hours – long after the congregation had concluded the service – they would nevertheless organize their time on Yom Tov so that they would conclude the amidah with the congregation and then recite Hallel together with them”.
This applies not only to Rosh Chodesh (and other times we recite chatzi Hallel), when there is a safek in regards to the proper way the Bracha on Hallel should be recited, but also to Chanukah and other Yomim Tovim -when regardles a Bracha on Hallel is said because the complete Hallel is recited- for there are other reasons that Hallel should be recited with the Minayn (namely, to answer  and  with the Minyan; it is more honorable to praise Hashemin public; to publicise the miracles we are praising Hashem for).###question 
  Can a father and son be called for Hagbah and Glilah?.
 ###answer 
 In a Shul where it is not the custom to call them up by name and also not to say a Mi Shebeirach for them, yes. Otherwise, no.###question 
  Can I write Parshas Ha’azinu not as part of a Sefer Torah?
Can I write Parshas Ha’azinu (as in this picture) not as part of a Sefer Torah? If yes, can it be written using ksav ashuris?.
 ###answer 
 
This should not be written.###question 
 Is it a problem to drink water while eating fish or right after eating fish without eating or drinking something in between?.
 ###answer 
 
Some are particular about this. The common custom is not to be particular about this. Nonetheless, it’s best to eat or drink something else first or have the water flavored somewhat.

 1) Do I need to make a new Brocha if I change my Tzitzis midday (after exercise, for example)?.
 ###answer 
 2a) If I merely try-on a pair of Tzitizis, or otherwise plan to soon take them off—is a Brocha still required?
2b) What if I try them on over another pair of Tzitzis? Do I need to make a Brocha for both pairs?
Answers:
1) Yes. 
A new Mitzvah is performed every time one wears a four-cornered garment with Tzitzis. Therefore, a Bracha should be made each time one puts on Tzitzis.
2-a) Yes. 
As long as one benefits from wearing a garment, Tzitzis is required and a Brocha should therefore be made (benefit can include simply not being without Tzitzis even for a moment). (According to Poskim, wearing the Tzitzis for the time it takes to walk four cubits (3 seconds) qualifies as “deriving benefit”.)
2-b) No. 
As mentioned, each four-cornered garment you wear is an additional Mitzvah and therefore requires a new Bracha (no matter how many pairs you are wearing). In this case, however, you are merely trying-on the Tzitzis for size and no benefit is had. And unlike above, the benefit of avoiding being temporarily without the Mitzva is also absent (since you have not taken off your own Tzitzis).###question 
  Do we hold that one shouldn’t take a piece off the bread with one hand and eat with the other hand?.
 ###answer 
 The rule of not holding the food in one hand and tearing off a piece with the other hand applies only to food which is on a plate. Food which is normally held by hand such as bread may be eaten that way.###question 
 How to use a toilet which flushes by a sensor?.
 ###answer 
 Where no other bathroom is available, you may use an auto-flush toilet by activating the sensor in an irregular manner, for example walking away on your heels or sides of the feet in an uncomfortable manner. Ideally, you should first place a tissue or paper towel over the sensor, in a manner that it will eventually fall off later by itself, so that the toilet won’t flush immediately when you leave the toilet.
How to use water from a faucet which is operated only by sensor?
You should use a bottle of water or another cleanser.
Where this is not possible: After using the bathroom, you may satisfy with rubbing your hands with a cloth or other material, unless you’re planning on davening thereafter, in which case you may ask a non-Jew to fill up a cup of water for you. If however, you want to wash your hands before davening but you did not use the bathroom or touch parts of the body that are usually covered, you should just rub your hands. For washing before bread or upon awakening in the morning, you may also ask a non-Jew to fill up water for you.
Can we use the “Shabbos” elevator?
Wherever you can, you should use the staircase.###question 
 Our son was born on 19 Iyar. This year Erev Shavuos is on Shabbos. When should we make the Upshernish – on Friday 4 of Sivan or Tuesday Isru Chag?.
 ###answer 
 
• Generally:
For a child whose birthday is from after Lag Baomer until Erev Shavuos, the Upshernish haircut should take place on Erev Shavuos. [When Erev Shavuos falls on Shabbos – on 4 Sivan (with the exception of someone whose birthday is on Erev Shavuos, in which case it should be postponed until after Shavuos)].
See more in the following pages:
https://asktherav.com/4243-when-should-one-get-his-hair-cut-before-shavuos-this-year-since-erev-shavuos-is-shabbos/
https://asktherav.com/13133-when-should-a-boy-start-wearing-kippa-and-tzitzis/
• However, regarding someone whose birthday is on 19 Iyar, a day after Lag Baomer:
There are instructions from the Rebbe to perform the haircut on Lag Baomer.
While in most places it appears that it should take place on Lag Baomer itself (during the day), a day before the child turns 3, others record that it should be done on the actual birthday, right after nightfall on the night after Lag Baomer.
See here the testimony of three people who were all instructed by the Rebbe to do it on Lag Baomer: R. SB Popak, R. YY Hecht and R. Refoel Hartman. In the case of R. Hecht, the Rebbe himself did the cutting. (This information has been independently verified by us). In the case of R. Hartman, we have the actual answer of the Rebbe.
Independent of the above, there is yet another directive presented regarding the Upshernish of Ari Halberstam hy”d (whose birthday is on 19 Iyar), of which there are pictures of the Rebbe cutting the hair. See in the Hebrew references below.
This account raises several questions. Regardless, I feel there is enough information to rely upon to do it on Lag Baomer (by day).###question 
  Is it OK to use a portable (empty) Aron Kodesh as a prop in a Torah educational production (at a different location than the shul)?.
 ###answer 
 Yes.###question 
  Is there a problem with wearing a Mezuzah necklace? If not, can it be used on Shabbos in a place without an Eiruv?.
 ###answer 
 Permitted. However, you must ensure to remove it before entering a bathroom or any other unclean place. It may also not be worn or be in the room during intimate relations.
It may not be worn on Shabbos in a place without an Eiruv. One should not wear it at all on Shabbos because one might forget to remove it before going out of the home.###question 
 1) Once I finished the meal, do I still need to bentch since I didn’t eat a  of bread?.
 ###answer 
 2) Would I need to eat a  of bread because I had said the Bracha    (originally I said the Bracha because I had thought I would eat a  but then changed my mind)?
Answers:
1. You shouldn’t bentch unless you ate a kezayis of bread.
2. No.###question 
  Can I buy eggs in a non-Kosher supermarket?
If I buy eggs from Costco (instead of a kosher supermarket), can I treat them like buying eggs from a kosher supermarket, or is there anything I need to know extra, like looking at the shape of each egg etc?.
 ###answer 
 
If you are buying chicken eggs, there is nothing extra to check as long as the eggs look normal.
 ” ” ’ ” ’ ’ ” .###question 
 Does this apply to just food or also all Shabbos needs?
For example, I want to buy my wife a Leichter. Can I rely on this to spend as much as I can afford for it to be the most beautiful possible?
Is the fact that I’m buying it to make my wife happy take away from buying it Likovod Shabbos?.
 ###answer 
 
It applies not only to  food but all shabbos needs, provided the individual’s intention is for kavod Shabbos and he has trust in Hashem that he will repay.
However, this applies only if it’s based on the persons current financial level and his regular spending habits. It  does not apply if one will have to borrow money for this unless he has objects he can use as a collateral.

Silk Kapoteh On Shabbos###question 
 Someone told me that he heard from a bochur a baal dikduk that whenever there is a yud after a chyrik – that chyrik is pronounced like the first chyrik in the word “CHYrik”, not like the second one “chyRIK” which is pronounced like a shva. For example the word  or  and  or . Is this true (and ) for reading or leining?.
 ###answer 
 
One should not change from what is commonly practiced in the place where they live. Poskim tell us while dikduk is very important, one should ensure that they do not overemphasize the dikduk in such a way that it sounds very strange to the listeners.
Either way, none of these issues affect the kashrus of the leining. Even where it can have bearing on the meaning of the word, many poskim maintain that one is still yotze, if the change was one relating to dikduk.
P.S. Even though a chirik malei is a tenuah gedola, it doesn’t necessarily mean it should be announced as “ee” (although many sources seem to imply this), rather it’s emphasized more and longer, similar to how Sefardim pronounce, or should pronounce, the difference between Komatz and Patach. Generally, different communities have different methods of pronunciation of the various vowels and none of them make all the distinctions obvious as should be. One not deviate from what is commonly done in their community.###question 
  Can a Senior who can’t stand do Birchas Kohanim?
He is in a wheelchair so he can’t stand, he also can’t keep his hands up for the entire Bracha. Also, being that he has braces on his feet, taking off his shoes is quite an ordeal and uncomfortable for him. However, I should stress that going up to duchan is one of the highlights of his Yom Tov, so is there any room for leniency?.
 ###answer 
 
Standing: A kohen which cannot stand, even just for the small amount of time which it takes to say one of the words of Birchas Kohanim, may not do Birchas Kohanim.
If he is able to stand up and lean on something, there is a Machlokes and he should therefore leave the shul before Retzei. Even if he cannot stand at all, it is preferred for him to leave as well.
If he stayed inside, he may hear the Bracha from the other kohanim and join them by saying the words of Birchas Kohanim.
Lifting Hands: A kohen which cannot hold up his hands without support, should not do Birchas Kohanim.
Shoes: A kohen which cannot remove his shoes, may use non-leather slip-on shoes which are clean and should not stand on a raised platform.###question 
 Q. Should I try to put tefillin with him on both arms?.

 A. Yes.
Q. Which arm would be optimal to put on tefillin with him (assuming he doesn’t have time – or agree – to put on both)?
A. Left.###question 
  Can Raw Eggs Become Milchig?
Raw eggs got wet from milk on the way back from shopping, and I haven’t rinsed them when I came home, they sat like that for over 24 hours, are they now Milchig?.
 ###answer 
 
If the eggs were to actually sit in milk – they would be Milchig.
In your case – they aren’t Milchig.###question 
  How many women must be in a house in the evening if a man is there and his wife is in the city but out of the house for the evening?.
 ###answer 
 A man may not be with even two women as this is yichud.
According to many poskim, this applies even to more than two women. This is the accepted practice.
However, some poskim maintain that more than two women is permissible. When desperate, and no other choices are available there might be room to rely on this position.
Even according to the lenient position, by night or when traveling, some say that even many women is forbidden. Others say it would need to be four women. This is the accepted position, in desperate situations, as mentioned.
If one has a job which the nature of the job brings him in contact with women, all agree that yichud is forbidden even with three or more women.
A wife protects from yichud only if she in the house.

 I’ve been offered pews from a temple and was wondering if it would be ok to accept this donation or would it be unacceptable for us to do so since it was previously used by reform and conservative. If yes, how about the Bimah and Aron Hakodesh?.
 ###answer 
 
The pews may certainly be used. The bima and aron hakodesh should not be used.###question 
  Which Bracha does one make on a meat barley soup?.
 ###answer 
 1. Even if there is no meat in a soup but it was cooked with meat, the taste of the meat overrides the taste of the vegetables and the Bracha is Shehakol.
2. If the soup was cooked with grain which is Mezonos, with the intention of eating the grain, the soup becomes Mezonos even when one drinks the soup on its own. This applies even if it was cooked with meat. If there is now visible meat in the soup, it is questionable whether the visible meat requires its own Bracha.
If the soup was cooked just for the liquid, the soup is Shehakol. If one is now eating the grain with the soup, one should first make Shehakol on the soup and then Mezonos on the grain.
3. If the soup is cooked with grain which is Ha’adama, the Bracha in the soup is Shehakol, regardless. If eating the grain with it, one should first say Shehakol on the soup and then Ha’adama on the grain.
4. Barley soup is questionable whether the grain is considered Mezonos or Ha’adama. If the barley kernel was split into pieces it’s Mezonos. If it’s a whole kernel, as in pearl barley, it’s Mezonos, if it’s shelled. Others say the kernels must become soft and stick to each other due to a lot of cooking, in order to become Mezonos. Otherwise, it’s Ha’adama.

  How do the Levi’im wash the Kohanim’s hands before Birchas Kohanim?.
 ###answer 
 No need to wash three times. If washing three times, wash three consecutive times one hand and then the same on the other hand.###question 
  May I kick a package through the doorway into my apartment on Shabbos?
There have been package thefts in my building. On Shabbos may I kick a package through the doorway and into the apartment? There is an Eiruv Chatzeros in the building. Is the din the same on Yom Tov?.
 ###answer 
 
For your situation (where an Eiruv Chatzeiros was done):
If the delivery man leaves the package in a place where it is permissible to carry on Shabbos to and from your apartment, you can bring the package into your apartment using a Shinuy – same applies to Yom Tov.
However, it is important to mention that this is only if a proper Eiruv Chatzeiros was done (which causes the entire area covered by the Eiruv to be considered within Daled Amos of the original location).
However, in a situation where there is no Eiruv Chatzeiros, you would not be allowed to move it outside of Daled Amos of the location the delivery man placed it. This applies even on Yom Tov (when carrying can be permitted in a regular circumstance), since it came from outside the Techum, it is bound by the Halachos of Techum which apply equally on Shabbos and Yom Tov.###question 
  Who Should Lead the Zimun?
Is there a Minhag for the Baal Habais to lead the Zimmun?
Is there a difference between Shabbos night and Shabbos day meal?
What if there is a kohen present?.
 ###answer 
 
There is such a custom that on Friday night the host leads the zimmun. Otherwise, he may honor the guest. This custom applies even when a kohen is present.
Explanation:
Although there is a mitzvah to honor the guests, this only applied in the past when only one individual bentched and he exempted the others. Nowadays, when everyone bentches themselves there is no such mitzvah. Even in those days, if the host wished to lead the bentching himself and not honor the guest, at any time, he may do so.
A kohen takes precedence only if he is equal in Torah standing to the others. Otherwise, the Talmid Chochom precedes him. Additionally, all this applies where all attendees are hosts or all are guests (and the host isn’t joining).###question 
  Are we careful about leaving water overnight? Do we need to invert pans after cleaning?.
 ###answer 
 There are two issues:###question 
 The problem is that we need to move there already this time next year since we are not able to afford to pay rent and mortgage at the same time and we cant start building until September. Any way around this?.
 ###answer 
 
All of this applies only if there was no building whatsoever in the entire area, even a small building.
If there was indeed no building, including a structure for the construction crew, the rule is as follows:
Regarding the area of the Shul, it is not an issue.
For the residential areas, if it’s for a home for a teacher or any other communal worker, it is not an issue. There’s also room for leniency if being bought by a young couple right after marriage.
If they’re being rented out and the owner is not the one living there, it’s not an issue either.
If the owner himself is living on the property, he should build a sukkah there first and afterwards it’s not a problem. Also, a proper Chanukas Habayis should be done to consecrate the home for Torah and Davening.
Another option is to make an independent “sale” of the home to someone else for the first year, and then one may live there immediately thereafter. (Alternatively, if you already own it prior to it being finished, you can sell it right then and there, and only when it’s complete will you re-purchase it).
Regardless, you should receive approval of three Rabbonim to go ahead with either of these leniencies.
The 12 months wait does not begin when the entire building was completed; it begins from when the building was above the height of the windows.###question 
  Someone honored me to be Sandek. Am I required to pay them something for the Zchus?.
 ###answer 
 There is no requirement, but it is a Minhag to pay for part or all of the Seudah, depending on circumstances.###question 
 I heard that Kabbalisticlly it’s not good to cover the head Tefillin with ones Tallis. So what is one supposed to do for Birchas Kohanim when he’s supposed to cover his face with his tallit while he’s wearing Tefillin?.
 ###answer 
 
Generally the Tefillin shel Rosh should be visible, but according to Kabalah they should be at least partially covered with the Tallis.
Regarding Birchas Kohanim: The Kohanim should cover their heads including their tefillin. As for the congregation, they should preferably cover just their their face with the Tallis on the sides of their face leaving the Tefillin revealed.###question

 I have heard that on some fast days and the night following it, meat/chicken shouldn’t be eaten. Which fast days does this apply to and is this the same Din for someone not fasting (pregnancy, nursing etc.)?.
 ###answer 
 
This applies according to Halacha the night after Tisha B’av. Some follow this custom on the night preceding and following every fast. This concept can apply even to to those who do not fast, if their health permits.
However, the Alter Rebbe implies that this applies only in relation to the night after the fast. Since the Alter Rebbe mentions it only regarding fasts which one takes upon themselves for atonement, it is likely he does not agree with keeping this stringency regarding other regular fasts. The general custom is not to refrain from meat and wine on the nights after regular fasts. In fact, many Tzadikim Davka ate a festive meat meal after the fast.###question 
  Is there any Inyan for a Ben Noach to toivel in Mikveh to undo baptizing (as an infant) to idolatrous religion?.
 ###answer 
 There no such requirement, but there is room to do so as a practice of teshuvah.###question 
  Can young children learn a Bracha, part at a time?
For example:
To say the first couple lines of asher yatzar (repeating after the teacher word by word). Once they’ve mastered this, to add on another line etc..
 ###answer 
 
Both from a halachic perspective, as well as a chinuch perspective, it would be better to teach the full Beracha, with the teacher saying word by word and the child repeating (even if they don’t say every word). This way they learn that there is only one Beracha and there is no shortcuts.
If the child is older and should be able to say the full Beracha and is not pronouncing it correctly, the teacher may ask them to say the line over and over again so they learn how to pronounce it properly. In this case, Hashem’s name should not be repeated.###question

If the oven has a self-clean setting (a “continuous cleaning” setting is not the same), the metal cover separating the actual fire from the oven cavity (where you place the food. The self-clean cycle would suffice provided a complete cycle has run. If your oven has a glass window it  should be fully covered
Kashering manually:
Koshering an oven manually is extremely difficult (without causing damage to the oven and to one’s self) and should be done only by someone who has much experience.
Non self clean ovens:
The grates must be blow torched by a professional till they are red hot. The oven should then be switched on for an hour on the highest setting. After this one may bake food only if double wrapped or in an insert.
Kashering stove-tops (burners):
Which stove tops can be koshered: only gas and electric stove tops can be koshered. Glass stove tops cannot be koshered. Enamel stove tops: though the enamel itself can not be koshered, the stove top can be used if the following koshering and guidelines are followed.
Preparing the stove top: the stove top must be thoroughly cleaned. if any dirt or rust is on the stove top it cannot be koshered (generally speaking). however, a mere discoloration is fine. (feel the rusty looking spot with your hand to ascertain if it is just a discoloration or if there is actual rust)
The stove top should not be used for 24 hours prior to koshering.
The stove top must be completely dry before koshering.
Koshering the stove top:

 I asked my brother for a large loan and he was not able to give me one. However, he offered to give me from his bank (home equity) line of credit which charges interest of approximately 6%. I assured him that any interest charges he incurs I will repay so that he does not lose anything for giving me the loan. We want to ask if there is any problem with doing this?
The loan was for a little over a month and the repayment would be sent directly to his bank, not to him..
 ###answer 
  
If the bank holds your brother accountable to pay, which in your case that’s what it sounds like, then it is a problem. Therefore, you can make up to pay the loan, but not the interest.###question 
  Is one allowed to use the cold water from a water cooler on Shabbos when it is plugged in?.

 1) Is it permissible to have ‘Kosher’ Slurpees from ‘7-11’, not knowing if they exchange flavors frequently?
A) Will the utensil be considered non-Kosher   of a non-Kosher flavor, or  doesn’t apply to a slurpee machine being that the liquid is constantly moving and refilled as customers purchase slurpees?
B) Will it be considered  into the ‘Kosher’ slurpees, for the same reasoning?
C) Can we assume that they cleaned the machine well when exchanging flavors?.
 ###answer 
 
Depending on the details, it would likely be permitted based on the rule of nullification in sixty times of the non-kosher.
Kavush wouldn’t  be a problem as the kosher Slurpee’s would only absorb the taste of the Keli after 24 hours, in which case it would be Pagum.
״ ״ , .
This question should be addressed to the certifying Hechsher, if there is one, or the agencies which produce lists of kosher Slurpee’s.
Of course, it’s always best to use Slurpee’s from a kosher certified location
From what I’ve read, but haven’t verified it myself:
99.9% of Slurpee flavors are kosher pareve. The Slurpee machine operates at 28°F, too cold for there to be any blios flavor. There are also no issues of kavush because of the high turnover of product. The flavors don’t usually sit in the machines for 24 hours. The compartment in the machine is so small that the Slurpee flavor is replaced after filling a few cups.
However, Slurpee is a registered trademark sold only at 7-Eleven stores. Other gas stations or convenience stores sell similar products but more caution is needed when purchasing from them. While 7-Eleven stores mostly use the main brands which are more likely to be kosher certified, other stores may use generic-brands that are not necessarily kosher certified. If the dispenser is shared among more than one flavor, and you cannot confirm that they are all kosher, it is recommended to run the machine until there is no residue of the previous flavor before filling your cup.

  What is the din for imitation meat?
What is the din for imitation (fake, faux, parve) meat (made out of fruit, nuts, and vegetables)?
I am assuming it is completely mutar to have during the 9 days. However, the taste and look are surprisingly realistic.
1. To what extent can we make and eat mixtures of dairy with fake meat (i.e. a cheese “burger”)? And can this be done in all places (is there a difference whether in Crown Heights or in a town where most Yidden are not yet religious and may mistaken it for a real cheeseburger)?
2. If bsar n’veila falls in to a pot of fake meat, can it be considered min b’mino?.
 ###answer 
 
In today’s day and age where soy meat is very common it is permissible to eat in the nine days or with milchig.
If there’s a certain style or look which is not common it could be a problem, unless the wrapping would be there, or at least a written sign.
Fake meat is not considered min b’mino with real meat.###question

 My brother works in a store in Crown Heights and found a stroller that was left behind already for three days. He offered it to me and said that if I don’t take it he’ll end up throwing it out. I posted the stroller on a couple of WhatsApp groups and no one responded. I really do want that stroller and otherwise it’ll be thrown out. Can I take it and use it?.
 ###answer 
 
You have the obligation to publicize that you found this stroller in a way that the owner would find out about it (WhatsApp groups would not suffice under normal circumstances as not everyone has WhatsApp).
After a couple of days go by after you would assume that the owner found out where they lost it or who they can contact to receive their stroller back, you may:
1) Write down:
▪ Any Simanim that there is on the stroller;
▪ The time and place it was found.
2) Three people should evaluate the price and write it down.
From then on one can use the item for oneself.
If or when – with the coming of Moshiach, certainly the matter will be resolved – the owner should show up and give you the accurate details of the lost object, you are obligated to give them the amount it was worth at the time of the loss.###question 
  My son will IYH be making a Siyum on the day of his Bar Mitzvah. Can he say Kaddish?
If he learnt the mesechta/seder as a katan, and finishes as a gadol (on his Bar Mitzvah day) is Kaddish recited afterwards?.
 ###answer 
 
Yes, if there’ll be a Minyan present, See also here.
The Kaddish to be said is a regular Kaddish Derabanan – see here and here.
If there will be someone with a Chiuv present, the custom is that they say the Kaddish. Otherwise, the one who makes the Siyum says it. If he is a minor before his Bar Mitzvah, an adult should say it (although a minor may technically say Kaddish as done by yesomim. See here).###question

  Can I watch a nice message from a reform/conservative rabbi filmed in his sanctuary?.
 ###answer 
 Questions:
I was recently sent via WhatsApp a speech from a conservative rabbi speaking favorably about Chabad that was filmed in his sanctuary..
Is it mutar to listen to words from a reform/conservative rabbi if they are favorable words?
Is there a difference if it was filmed in his shul/sanctuary? I know we don’t enter their sanctuary.. What about viewing a video of their sanctuary?
If it was filmed on Shabbos, would such a video be appropriate to watch?
Answers:
Yes, as long as there’s no heresy in those words.
It’s inappropriate to watch such videos, though not forbidden.  – See similarly:

  What Should Be Done With An Amputated Leg?
A Yid I know will probably have his leg amputated (from above the knee and down).
Does the leg need to be buried in a cemetery or can it be buried a backyard or the like?
Is there anything Tefilos/Tahara that has to be done?.
 ###answer 
 
It does not need to be buried. The custom is to bury it anyhow, either due to tumas kohanim or as a minhag.
There is no need to do tahara, but some do it. Some save it, or un-dig it, to be buried later together with the rest of the body.###question 
  Does a garment that is 100% wool need to be checked for Shatnez?.
 ###answer 
 Yes.
According to American federal law, garments must have a label which lists the exact content of the fabric. However, this refers only to the material of the main shell fabric of the garment, but not to any threads or materials in the linings, backings, reinforcements, ornaments, padding, loops, fillings and other internal components. Thus, a label which states that the garment is 100% wool can contain as much as 2% of other materials and thus be shatnez.
Furthermore, the government is extremely lax in enforcing these laws. There isn’t also much concern for potential liability resulting from adverse reactions to the fabric, as fabric allergies are uncommon and usually not that serious. Many clothing manufacturers and distributors don’t bother therefore to identify accurately which fibers they use. They are may even deliberately misrepresent the information in order to boost their sales, since they know that they don’t much to fear from law enforcement agencies or other potential liabilities.
This is true even in places where such laws are in place. Many garments are manufactured in labor-cheap, third-world countries where mislabeling is common practice.###question

  Can I invite someone who is in the process of converting over for a Yom-Tov meal?
There is a fine young man in our community in the process of converting. He’s so frum and aidel. Wakes up early, studies many hours of Torah per day, davens with Minyan 3 times a day, and keeps many halachic chumras.
If I see him in shul on yomtov, may I invite him over for a meal?
On one hand… We are forbidden to cook for a non-Jew.
On the other hand… If he’s not invited to learn about the chagim and experience the meals (in a sukkah), how can he properly convert?
Would it make a difference (or is it better) if I invite him without telling my wife after she already cooked the food?
Is it true the Rebbe said that there is a mitzvah of Ahavas Yisroel to ger in the process of converting? If so.. How can we ignore him?
Thank you.

He may be invited, provided that the following conditions are kept:
All food is cooked before Yom Tov;
He is told that one may not cook for a non Jew on Yom Tov;

  Can using Rooting Hormone be an issue of Kilayim?
It’s common to use rooting hormone when growing new trees from cuttings. Now the question is, since some hormones are made naturally by grinding up arovos (Willow) – is it considered kilayim.
If say I dipped a cutting (a cut of stick branch, which will become a new tree) into that ground of arovos solution. Is it considered kilayim?.

You should refrain from doing so even if you are planting a non-fruit-bearing tree unless the willows have rotted or decomposed to the point that they cannot grow any longer.###question

  Can I do Birkas Kohanim if I have negative feelings towards someone?
If a kohen has negative feelings towards one person or a group of people in shul, is he allowed to do Birkas Kohanim? What should he do in such a situation?.
 ###answer 
 
Yes. If there is indeed hatred chas v’sholom, he should do everything he can to uproot the hatred and instill within himself true Ahavas Yisroel.
If he hasn’t managed to uproot the hatred at least for the time of duchaning, he must leave the shule before Retzei.
The concern is only if there is hatred, not if there are negative feelings. Even so, he should initially make sure that he has no negative feelings.
This only applies if he has these feelings towards the community at large, or most of them, not to a couple of individuals.###question

  Is it Minhag Chabad to begin Shnayim Mikra on Thursday night?
The Rebbeim of Chabad [would fulfill the obligation to review the weekly Torah portion twice in the original and once in the Aramaic translation in the following manner. They] would review one or two aliyos on Thursday night.
On Friday afternoon they would begin reviewing the weekly portion again from the beginning, reading the entire sidrah and the haftarah.
On Shabbos morning, before praying, they would review the reading from the seventh aliyah onward again.
When there were two haftaros, they would recite the haftarah linked to the weekly Torah reading on Friday, and the other haftarah (e.g., the one linked to Shabbos Rosh Chodeshor to the day preceding Rosh Chodesh) on Shabbos.
– Hayom Yom 4 Teves
Is the above Hayom Yom (specifically doing the first, or first two aliyos, on Thursday night and the seventh again Shabbos morning) a hora’ah l’rabim – something all chassidim should be doing, or is it just a documentation of the Rabbeim’s persanol custom?.
 ###answer 
 
It seems from the Rebbe that this is l’rabim, although this isn’t conclusive.###question 
 I have learned in Kitzur Shulchan Aruch Siman 12 that “If you are traveling and reach the place where you wish to lodge, and ahead of you within a distance of four mil . . you must go four mil ahead in order to pray with the congregation”, How does that work with nowadays cars, and easy transportation?
In my particular case regarding Mincha, there is a minyan about 15 minutes away from where I work, stopping my work, traveling, davening, and returning to my work would take around 40 minutes.
Is this halachically required or can I daven myself at my place of work?
More generally, are there principles by which I can figure out what to do in other cases?.
 ###answer 
 
Traveling to Daven with a Minyan
One must travel 18 or 24 minutes (a shiur of a mil) each way in order to daven with a minyan. Therefore, if one has a car, he should travel 24 minutes by car each way (all together 48 minutes). If one does not have a car and is walking, he should walk 24 minutes each way (all together 48 minutes).
If one is traveling and the minyan is on the way he must travel up to 72 minutes. Some say 96 minutes.
If one will incur a loss of money by attending a minyan, one is allowed to skip that minyan. However, foregoing potential profit/revenue is not considered a loss.
For general laws about this subject see the Alter Rebbe’s Shulchon Aruch 90:17.
Davening with the Minyan from afar
Regarding a case where one can’t make it to a minyan under the above circumstances, he should aim to daven at the time that the tzibur is davening for this time is an eis ratzon. He will not be yotze tevillah btzibur, but it’s still an accomplishment. Ibid 90:10.
However one may not answer   if there are unclean areas between him and the minyan davening. The same applies to answering Amen on brochos as well. Ibid 90:11.
Regarding answering on the phone, one may answer Amen and all devarim shebikdusha, and there is no need to be concerned about unclean areas in between, provided there is no delay (as is common on websites with live webcams) between the bracha and Amen. However, it may not be used to be yotze havdalah or other obligations.###question

Men may not listen to a woman rapping. This is included in the rule “  ”.
Since one is still benefiting from her voice even in a non-normal way of singing this is also included in the prohibition.

 In order to fulfill the mitzva of     according to what the  brings, by saying “  ” – Do I need to say “” or is “ ” enough because I’m obviously counting to/from Shabbos?
Also, does it apply to writing also?.
 ###answer 
 
An introductory comment: 
This mitzvah is already accomplished by saying the shir shel yom and there is no requirement to say it again throughout the day. Furthermore, the Rebbe suggests that the obligation, which is accomplished by saying so once a day as mentioned, exists only when anyhow counting the days of the week. The Rebbe adds that it appears that the custom isn’t in accordance with this opinion.
Nonetheless, it appears that according to this opinion there would at least be a   when counting to Shabbos.
As to your questions: 
While many sources specify saying “Yom Rishon b’Shabbos”, it’s possible that saying just “Yom Rishon” is sufficient. Perhaps, the actual count to Shabbos is achieved by saying just “Yom Rishon”, however, it is lacking the mitzvah to mention Shabbos daily.
There is a machlokes if this mitzvah applies in writing too. The common custom, among Gedolei Yisroel too, is not to be particular about writing specifically the weekday count in letters (in contrast to the monthly count).###question 
  When is Siyum HaKadish?
BH dear Rabbi, my father passed on the first day of Rosh Chodesh Iyar this year – the 30th of Nissan. As Adar only has 29 days, would I be stopping to say Kaddish for the 11 months erev Rosh Chodesh Nissan? Or on Rosh Chodesh after mincha?.
 ###answer 
 
The common custom seems to be to stop and say the last kaddish at Mincha on Erev Rosh Chodesh (though it would appear to me that one should stop on the 28th at Mincha).
Yes, one does daven by the amud on erev Rosh Chodesh.###question

 ###answer 
 Initially one should make the Bracha on a large and whole bread. If there isn’t any whole bread, the Bracha should be made on the larger piece.
When one will cut the bread into a smaller piece after making the Bracha before eating, the bread should be dipped it into the salt only after cutting that slice (as done at the Shabbos meal).
If, however, the (larger) slice of bread is already small and one will ingest it as is, one should dip it into the salt before making the Bracha.###question 
  For business purposes, 3 Jews purchase a hotel. They have a managing company managing it. In the hotel there is a Treif restaurant. Is that an issue?.
 ###answer 
 There is a prohibition of doing business with non-kosher food, in addition to the prohibition of benefiting from some issurim (such as milk and meat mixtures). The best solution is to rent out the restaurant space to a non-Jew, and the non-Jew runs the restaurant and pays a fixed amount as rent for the space. So advises Chelkas Binyamin 117:8.
[There is an additional problem of Shabbos operations and revenues. These matters can be dealt with by making a partnership with a non-Jew and drafting a contract which arranges that all Shabbos and Yom Tov revenues will be for the non-Jewish partner. This contract needs to be drafted with a Rav who is expert in this field.
(On a side note, managing a hotel on Shabbos is only allowed when it is done in an area which is not in a Techum Shabbos. If a business is within Techum Shabbos of the Jewish community, which means that it is within the city where one is allowed to walk on Shabbos to a place where Jewish people live and have a shul, there is a problem of Maris Ayin even if all the activities would be done by non-Jews. People will say that Jews operate a business and make money on Shabbos, even if all the work is done by non-Jews. See Shulchan Aruch Admur Hazaken (O.C. 244:1-3)). However, if there is a partnership and the non-Jew makes all the Shabbos and Yom Tov revenue, and it is not public knowledge that Jews “own the hotel”, then there is no   problem.
Thus this matter could depend on if the well majority of the hotel guests are non-Jewish and if the area is not a “Jewish area”. For these reasons, one would also not need to affix mezuzos on the doors.)###question

It is forbidden to answer “Thank G-d”. As it is considered saying Shem Shomayim l’vatalah.
Adding the word A-mighty doesn’t make it acceptable either; rather, it’s considered saying two names of Hashem l’vatalah. Some suggest saying “Thank the L-rd”, but not everybody considers this an acceptable option either. As for the Rebbe saying often “May G-d A-mighty bless you”, see below in the references.
There are many alternatives and you may choose whatever you are most comfortable with. For example, “Thank the One above”; “Thank G, O, D” (pronouncing the actual letters), or “Thank Him” (pointing upwards). You can choose any variation of the above, or other original ideas.
You should however not try to avoid thanking Him by using secular alternatives, such as “Thank Goodness”, as there is a Mitzvah to thank Hashem for everything.
May I add that the fact that it might sound bizarre shouldn’t be a concern; on the contrary, it is an opportunity to be Mekadesh Shem Shomayim and explain where possible and relevant your behavior, in order to show reverence to G-d, and in line with Halacha, Jewish law. Society nowadays respects people who live up to their values; bizarreness often provides an added dimension of intrigue leading to more respect and even awe.
As to your comment about Ama D’bar (the common custom of society at large) saying it, this is unfortunately true. Indeed, when Poskim caution against such behavior, they make mention of the fact that society is ignorant of this Halacha. However, it is noteworthy that the previous Rebbe remarked on this practice as follows: When a simple Jew says Gimmel Aleph Tes (G-o-t, the Yiddish equivalent of G-d) Atzmus (the very essence of Hashem) is speaking, but when a Ben-Torah says so it is [merely] a name of Hashem. Great caution is required when saying Hashem’s name.###question 
  Is it Ok for girls to bike in a non-Jewish neighborhood?.
 ###answer 
 It would be acceptable provided that it is done in a  way.      . I am not aware of a Halachik problem as long as there is gender separation and the girls are dressed tznius. This depends on local custom. I would check with Mechanchos in case they have specific guidelines.
In many places, it’s accepted that a girl from age 9 should not ride on a bike in a public place even if it is done in a tznius way. See Shevet Halevi 10:26, p. 23-4.
As mentioned before, it is also worth checking with the local mechanchim and Rabbonim.###question 
  What is the proper way to say the Bracha before and after Hallel?
What is the proper way to say the Bracha before and after Hallel?
In certain Siddurim it says that when half Hallel is said, the Tzibbur should be Yotzei the first Bracha with the Chazzans Bracha, but this does not seem to be common practice in Chabad.
As well as the final Bracha some say that when we say Chatzi Hallel we do not say the Bracha.
What is the proper way and why does it seem to say otherwise in many Siddurim?.
 ###answer 
 
The comment in Siddurim is the Psak of the Alter Rebbe. However, the Rebbe Rashab did not follow this Psak.
The Rebbe once mentioned that the custom of Chassidim is to “Chap Arein” (difficult to translate, especially in this context; perhaps, rush into it or seize the opportunity) and recite the Bracha silently.###question

  May one apply for a grant with no intention of keeping the conditions?
The big grant available for seminary makes you sign that you will continue after with college for at least a certain amount of time. Is one allowed to sign that and not actually go? It’s kind of lying if you sign and don’t go…but if I don’t get this grant I most probably won’t be able to go to seminary.. what should I do?.
 ###answer 
 
One may not lie or mislead people, Jews or non-Jews, including governments or institutions.
Even if this means you won’t be able to go to seminary, this wouldn’t justify deceptive practices on your part.
Regarding receiving a seminary grant, you should consult with an expert in these grants to see if there are grants that do not require one to commit themselves to enroll in a college afterwards.###question

 Bread was baked in a Fleishig oven (meat had been roasted uncovered in the oven within 24 hours previously). Someone, ignoring the warning sign on the bread package, cut off a slice of that bread and toasted it in a Milchig toaster oven to eat with cinnamon and sugar topping. The toaster oven probably was not used within 24 hours. Is there a Kashrus problem with the toaster oven? Is there a problem with the Milchig plate the hot toast was put onto? And what is the status of the Parve knife used to spread the margarine on the bread?.
 ###answer 
 
The toaster oven, the plate and the knife are all fine.###question 
 Is it better to learn 3 Perakim Rambam daily through an audio shiur (not live), or to learn 1 Perek but actually read the words out of a Sefer?.
 ###answer 
 
Either way has its pros and cons.
In practice you should learn 3 Perakim through the audio shiur and you should verbalize the words while listening to the shiur. If this is impossible, there is still preference to just listening to the audio, as when learning 3 Perakim one is actually learning more Torah, as well fulfilling the main takanah of learning Rambam. Also, there are aspects of limmud haTorah which are fulfilled when listening to a shiur too, namely yedias haTorah which is the main purpose of limmud HaRambam. Arguably it can be be considered as one who can’t verbalize the words of Torah and thus one still fulfills the mitzvah of ve’limadtem osam etc.

 ###answer

Those who recite Tachanun should do so while lowering their head and leaning on their arm.###question 
  Till when can Kiddush Levana be said? Can one rely on the lenient Poskim to say in second half of month?.
 ###answer 
 There are three main Shittos in the Poskim when the latest time for Kiddush Levana is:
1. Maharil – Until the exact halfway point between each Moilad. In other words, since there is 29 days, 12 full hours and 793/1080 of an hour (around 44 minutes) between each Moilad, the end time for Kiddush Levana will be 14 days, 18 hours and 396/1080 of an hour (around 22 minutes) after the previous Moilad. The common accepted practice is to calculate the Moilad times according to the clock in Eretz Yisroel. In the first instance, one should strive to follow this approach.###question 
  We have a new toaster oven. Which parts, if any, need to be Toiveled?.
 ###answer 
 A utensil does not require Tevilah when it does not come into direct contact with food when it is being prepared, served or eaten.
Therefore, the oven racks should be Toiveled, as food is sometimes placed directly on it. Similarly, the other components that come into direct contact food should be Toiveled. However, the oven itself need not be immersed. (Yoreh De ’ah 120).

  Is it OK to go to the Ohel at night?.
 ###answer 
 Question:
Is it OK to go to the Ohel at night?
How about not eating; I can’t eat all day, or it’s OK not to eat just from Shkiah?
Answer
The common custom is not to go to a Beis Hakvaros at night. While many have written extensively on this topic, proving that there’s no issue whatsoever with going at night, we find in the writings of the Minchas Elazar that one is supposed to go to Davka by day.
Nonetheless, there is no halachic prohibition to go at night. Indeed, many people do go at night, especially when going to Kivrei Tzadikm. When going at night, one shouldn’t say Chapters of Tehilim.
It is noteworthy, however, that although the Rebbe would frequent the Ohel on a constant basis, as far as we know he never went at night, though many times the visit extended long into the night.
The custom is to drink but not eat before visiting the Ohel.
There is no clear source which discusses this custom vis-a-vis going at night. Some say one may eat straight until sunset. Nonetheless many have the custom not to eat from the morning. At the same time, one should certainly not go on a full stomach. If going immediately after sunset, it makes sense to stop eating a while before that.###question 
  Is writing during Davening allowed?.
 ###answer 
 Yes, but not during Shema, Shemone Esrai or between Goal Yisroel and Shemone Esrai.
Ideally, this should not be done during Birchos Krias Shema, unless there is a need.###question 
  Are all watches permissible to be worn on Shabbos? Are they Muktzeh?.
 ###answer 
 Watches are not Muktzah unless you need to press a button to see the time.
Non-working watch: According to many opinions, if the watch is not working it is Muktzah.
Electrical: Even if the watch contains a computer inside it is not Muktzah, since its main purpose is to display the time. If you know that you are likely to press the button and use the computer, you should not wear it on Shabbos. Likewise, if it has a button to produce light and you might out of habit press it at night, you should put a sticker or something to remind you not to do so on Shabbos. Some put their watch on the other hand to help them remember not to do so on Shabbos.
Room temperature: A watch that displays the room temperature may not be worn, since this watch works only due to the movements of the one wearing the watch. If it measures the temperature but does not display it unless a button is pressed, it may be worn.
Glow in the dark: If a light turns on when you go into a dark room then it is a problem; if it just glows in the dark then it is okay.
Self-winding: Some watches are powered through movement. Although many are lenient, it is best for one not to wear a self-winding watch on Shabbos, because whenever you move your hand it causes the watch to recharge, especially or once you removed it from your hand and want to put it back. Many Poskim agree that it should not be worn on Shabbos once it stopped or if it is not sufficiently recharged to last throughout Shabbos.
Solar-powered: The same applies to a solar-powered watch which will recharge when entering a place which it well lit.
 Kinetic Watch: A kinetic watch operates slightly differently, where instead of a battery, one’s movement generates the needed. This is more severe and should certainly not be worn on Shabbos, especially with kinetic watches with digital displays. All the more so, with an Eco-Drive watch which enters slow down mode when there is no light and returns to normal function (digital displays, correct second hand time, etc.) when exposed to light.
Apple watches or Fitbits are forbidden on Shabbos. Your movements activate the functions and the display, it tracks all your steps, monitors your heartbeat and so much more.
If Shabbos started and you forgot to remove your apple watch, you should take it off right away, preferably by undoing the buckle and dropping it off your hand. One cannot move freely until it’s removed.
Many Chassidim do not wear a watch at all on Shabbos or Yom Tov.
Regarding wearing a watch outside in a place with no Eruv, see here:

  Can one make jello/pudding on Shabbos for Shabbos?.
 ###answer 
 It is not allowed.###question 
 I left a non-Jewish worker in my house (second floor of house) for several hours to do some work on a bookcase. I told him what time I would be back in the afternoon. His work was not in the kitchen but there definitely was access to the kitchen and he and his friend were in my house alone. I do not have any video cameras, and no one came In and out during that time. Is my unsealed Milchig and Fleishig foods in my fridge okay to be eaten?.
 ###answer 
 
The dishes are permitted after 24 hours. As any pots or pans can be problematic because the non-Jew might have used them, therefore they should not be used for 24 hours.
However there is no reason to be concerned about large pots and pans which is unlikely that he would use them if he is there by himself.
As for the food that was unsealed, if you recognize that it is the same food, in this case specifically, you may be lenient only after the fact, based on a number of considerations.###question

  Is there a problem davening on raised bleachers?
Is there a problem davening on raised bleachers (for example in 770 when there are big crowds and sometimes bochurim are standing on narrow benches that are raised) because of the fact that it is elevated and the fact that it is dangerous and one might not be able to focus because he is afraid that he might fall?.
 ###answer 
 
If they’re made in a solid way that there’s no fear of falling and there’s an area of 4×4 Amos (or the same overall size as 4×4, an area of about thirty-six square feet, even with different dimensions), one may daven there.
Also, if it is surrounded by at least 2 mechitzos which are each 10 tefachim high, there is room to permit to daven there. Preferably, there should be at least 3 mechitzos, as it is usually (two sides and back).
Likewise, if due to the set-up of the Shul and the large crowd it is a necessity to set things up this way, one may daven so, provided there is no fear of falling.###question

  Amira L’Nachri: Is Shvus D’Shvus not allowed by a Schir Yom?
We have a cleaning lady on Shabbos. When the need arises and it’s a Shvus dshvus I would tell her to do the melocha.
This is only permitted under certain conditions such as ltzorech mitzvah, ltzorech gadol, etc.
However, it came to my attention that since she is a schir yom, this is forbidden based on the Alter Rebbe 244,12. Is it true that any shvus dshvus is not allowed by a schir yom?.
 ###answer 
 
This is incorrect. Under the conditions that are permitted, it’s acceptable even with a schir yom.###question 
  Is Vegetarianism Compatible with Torah Values?
I have a friend who is, in his words, “a convinced vegetarian”. My question is if this belief is compatible with normative Judaism?.
 ###answer 
 
Although Adam Harishon was commanded to refrain from eating meat, Hashem granted Noach permission to eat meat after the mabul (flood)—for all his progeny, for all time.
On the subject of eating meat, the Torah is clear that it’s not only permitted, but preferred. There are a number of mitzvos associated with its consumption: it’s a mitzvah to eat meat on Yom Tov; meat (and alternatively chicken) is recommended as a standard Shabbos food; and it was a mitzvah to eat most karbanos (ritual sacrifices) in the Mikdash (Holy Temple). There are other times when eating meat takes on halachic significance.
Whereas avoiding meat for health reasons is acceptable, abstaining with an ideological basis is not in sync with Torah. Although there were yechidei segulah (individual Jews of high caliber) who abstained from eating meat based on certain ideologies, their path is not a derech l’rabim (an example for the masses); therefore, most of us should not refrain from eating meat as a matter of principle.###question 
 About 8 years ago I used a friend’s phone without permission and went on to various websites, not realising it I signed him up to SMS messages from these things which racked up a bill of several hundred GBP on his parents card.  Should I pay? Do they or he have to know the money is coming from me? Do I have to ask him for Mechila?.
 ###answer 
 
Causing someone to lose money or pay a charge is considered stealing and you must repay them for all charges that was your fault.
If you are embarrassed to pay them upfront you can give it to someone else that would give it to them.
If they do not know that you are the thief, they do not need to know that it is coming from you.
For a complete Teshuva you must ask them Mechila. The Mechila may however be done anonymously, e.g. through a messenger or through an anonymous email, etc. However, you must ascertain he actually forgives you, through receiving his reply.###question

  Should I say Kaddish for my son?

 I do a lot of street-mivtzoim throughout sukkos and at times when people are rushing I tell them just to hold the lulav and esrog together. Sometimes they do it but don’t get full grasp, so I have to hold it together with them (to assure it doesn’t fall). My question is: are they still  or do they have to be fully holding the lulav and esrog on their own?.
 ###answer 
 
There are several issues here:
The requirement of taking lulav. They need to close their fingers or even better lift it. At the very least, according to some opinions, holding it in such a way that it doesn’t fall is also considered taking.
The fact that two people are holding it together: If they hold in such a way that without your support it would not fall and you are just assisting, and reversely, without them holding it, it would fall, it is valid. Otherwise, they should hold it on their own.
There is an issue of kavanah, since the person is just holding it without being conscious of the fact that they are doing a mitzvah. This is only an issue on the first day. (See link below)
Likewise, it might not be considered a kinyan and therefore not theirs. This also is only an issue on the first day, and ideally one should be concerned about this on the second day too.###question 
  Is one allowed to pronounce the name of a Shul “Beth El”?
Is one allowed to pronounce the name of a Shul “Beth El”? Being that “E-l” is a name of Hashem.
Also, would one be required to write “E-l” or “-” with a dash?.
 ###answer 
 
One is not allowed to pronounce any name of Hashem in vain. this includes the name E-l.
When writing this name, a dash should be written between the E and L or  and .
However, when calling a place with the name Bethel, there is no issue to pronounce the name, and there is no need to place a dash in between the letters, although there is room for stringency.

  I see many people pick up the coins from Machatzis Hashekel a bunch of times when giving it. Is there a reason for this?.
 ###answer 
 The common custom is to exchange our personal money with the silver half dollars owned by the Shule. We lift up the Shule’s silver coins in order to acquire them and then give them to tzedaka. Some individuals give machatzis hashekel also on behalf of family members, and therefore they pick up the silver coins several times, to acquire them again after each time they gave them to tzedakah.
There are individuals who for some inexplicable reason have a custom that even if they are only giving only on their own behalf they lift up the coins three times. This custom has no known source or explanation. Some say that’s what the Rebbe did (although it could very well be that he was giving on behalf of others).###question

However, this has been completely omitted in Seder Birchas Henehenin ibid.).
Also note that the Nimukei Orach Chayim (225) implies that if one goes to a zoo, a couple blessings can be made, so one should not have in mind to exempt everything with one blessing.

On a side note, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach Z”L (quoted in Sha’arei Habracha p. 488) held that one can also recite a blessing on any strange looking animal.

“Matziv Gvul Almanah”:###question 
  Are women obligated in Machatzis Hashekel?
Are women obligated in Machatzis Hashekel on Taanis Ester?
If yes, is a women’s obligation fulfilled through her husband?
Also, should a father give Machatzis Hashekel for his baby?.
 ###answer 
 
Women are not obligated in giving Machatzis Hashekel.
However, some give on behalf of their wives and children (even babies) – this custom is mentioned in the Rebbe’s sichos. One who has begun this Minhag must continue to do so until they reach the age that they are obligated on their own (13 or 20; different opinions), unless they stipulated the first time that this is done Bli Neder.
The Rebbe spoke on 24 Adar Rishon 5752 that it would be good if parents would educate their children to give Machatzis Hashekel from their own  money.###question 
  Can I use Ma’aser money to give Matanos L’Evyonim on Purim?
 Or beyond Matanos L’evyonim, can I give Tzeddakah on Purim from Maaser?.
 ###answer 
 
Every person is required to give gifts or money of at least a nominal sum to two poor people on Purim. The obligation can be fulfilled through any type of gift: money, food or clothing.
The gifts should be worth at least a Perutah (approximately five cents). That is the minimum requirement; it is proper to give more. Giving to the poor further demonstrates the spirit of unity among the Jewish people.
The minimum amount of Matanos L’evyonim must be given from money that is not set aside for Maaser. The rest may come from Maaser.

  Is there a problem with sitting on a table?
I know it is said that Shulchan dome li’Mizbeach but I teach and therefore I spend a good amount of time during the day standing.
To rest my legs and avoid pains I sit on the tables of the kids that are next to me.
Is there a real problem with that?.

This should not be done.###question 
 In general, while we are particular to beli neder wash the kids hands nagel vasser each morning, how careful do we need to be about them touching things/food/eyes nose and mouth etc.? What’s the earliest age for boys? girls?.
 ###answer 
 
It is customary to be lenient when it comes to the touch of young children who have not reached the age of Chinuch. Although the Neshama of a child is considered fully developed when they reach Bar or Bas Mitzvah, the process of Neshama entry begins when the child starts their Chinuch education.
The process really starts even earlier, with the mitzvah of Mila. Therefore, someone who is careful about the touching of a male infant from the day of Milah onward is considered “holy”.
With a baby girl this applies from when she is born or from when she is given a name.###question 
  Do I have to take out my contacts when going to mikvah?
I’m a man, and recently I got contact lenses. Do I have to take them out when going to mikvah? (It’s a headache to take off and put on).
 ###answer 
 
Yes.###question 
  At which point must the Chazzan wait for at least six to be with the Minyan before continuing?.
 ###answer 
 In order to be considered Tefilah B’Tzibur there need to be at least six men davening Shmonah Esrei together. If there were no six people davening together, then one cannot do Chazaras Hashatz. If there aren’t six before Shmonah Esrei the Chazzan typically waits so it can be considered Tefilah B’Tzibur and the Chazzan can say Chazaras Hashatz.
However, it is advised to start and daven with a proper Minyan. This way one will not need to wait for six before Shmonah Esrei.
I have heard a theory (although I have not seen it printed in a Sefer) that based on certain wording in Shulchan Aruch the Shema and the Brachos before and after Shema should be said with a Minyan too, and therefore the Chazzan should wait by Yishtabach for six. However, the simple reading of the Shulchan Aruch does not indicate this, as will be explained in the Hebrew notes. Nonetheless, there are advantages in saying Shema with the Minyan.###question 
 A Ba’al Bris who made a Bris this morning and has Yortzheit so he is Davening Mincha at the Amud, what does he do about Tachnun, which he shouldn’t be saying but the rest of the Minyan should?.

  Can a Jew eat Kosher Meat that is blessed by Muslims?
Full Question:
I came across an interesting situation. There is meat that is Kosher slaughtered (certified by X) but during the Kosher slaughter Muslims say their blessing on it which also makes it Halal for them . . It is an interfaith meat. It is under X supervision . . And comes from a Glatt Kosher Slaughterhouse . . but these Muslims also do their thing with the meat . . Is this Kosher meat that is blessed by Muslims OK for Jews to eat?
There is a Muslim there saying a blessing while the Jews are doing the Kosher slaughtering. Also it is made sure that the animal is facing the Qibla (Muslim direction of prayer). They make sure that a horizontal cut is made not a vertical cut, in accordance with Islamic law.. All Jewish laws of slaughter and Muslim laws of slaughter are followed. The meat is 100% Halal and Kosher.
What is your opinion on this meat?.
 ###answer 
 
This practice is inappropriate and should be stopped where possible. Nevertheless, the meat remains completely Kosher.

Did the Alter Rebbe give a Size for a Revi’is?###question 
  Why do some people not drink red wine between 6 and 7 on friday?.
 ###answer 
 White wine: There is a custom not to make kiddush on Friday nights between 6 and 7. The original sources make no mention of red wine specifically; likewise, the explanations provided for the custom do not link it with the color of wine either. The accepted interpretation is that this applies to all types of wine, and according to many – even if one makes kiddush on bread.
The reason for this custom: the Gemara tells us that the hours of the day are associated with the seven Mazalos, constellations or planets – Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, each one operating hour of the day in a rotating system; these celestial forces have influence on this world during their corresponding hour. During this hour of 6-7, the constellation of Tzedek (and its corresponding angel Tzadkiel) ceases to be dominant and the constellation of Maadim takes over. Maadim (and its corresponding angel, Samael, pronounced usually as “the Samach Mem”, the source of evil who rules over this Mazal), -the mazal identified with the Esav (Edom), Amalek and Haman- is associated with negative influences and is said to be the cause of destruction, plagues, murder, sickness, and punishment, among other such causes. The Gemara tells us that those born during the hour of Maadim have a tendency towards becoming a Shochet or Mohel, a profession involving bloodshed.
Thus, it’s recommended to avoid acceptance of Shabbos through kiddush in the times when Maadim dominates, so as not to add spiritual energy to Maadim. The reason for the partcular caution when making kiddush because Chazal tell us that two angels accompany people on their way back home from shule on Friday night—a good angel and an evil angel. If the house has been prepared (the candle lit, the table set etc.), the good angel gives a blessing that the next Shabbos will be the same, and the evil angel is forced to respond Amen. If the house is not prepared for Shabbos, the evil angel wishes that the next Shabbos will be the same, and the good angel is forced to respond Amen. These two angels correspond to the Mazalos of Tzedek, Jupiter, and Maadim, Mars. Thus, at this time it’s important not to allow the negative angel dominion over us.###question 
  Do the restrictions on not eating Matzah 30 days before Pesach apply to products made with Matzah meal (i.e. Kneidlach)?.
 ###answer 
 No.###question 
  Is one allowed to pull open the seal of a carton orange juice bottle on Shabbos?
I am referring to the seal under the cap that you need to pull hard to rip off..
 ###answer 
 
It has come to our attention that there is no preexisting opening on the orange juice container. Thus, when removing the ring tab one is creating a new opening and therefore it shouldn’t be done on Shabbos. It would be best to remove the entire top of the carton and avoid the issue.
Regarding opening bottle caps, there is an argument amongst contemporary Poskim, if one is allowed to open it on Shabbos. Therefore one should open before Shabbos.###question 
  Must a new Sefer Torah be used for the first year?
We started a Shabbos Minyan in our community a few years ago and brought in a family Sefer Torah from another location on the  that it’ll be read from every week.
Recently someone else brought in a new Sefer Torah and insists that ”  the new Sefer Torah must be read in every Shabbos so as to look for any mistakes that there may be.
A Bar Mitzvah boy Lained in it last week, and I doubt he was looking out for any Mistakes.
Is there any  regarding such a situation?.
 ###answer 
 
It is not a Halachah but a Minhag.
Some say only the first Shabbos, some say the first 4 Shabbosim.
Some say the whole first year the new Sefer Torah should be used. The reason being that when the Ba’al Koreh is reading from the Torah the congregation will hear if he missed a word or if pronounced mistakenly etc. and with that check to see if it has any mistakes (according to this it doesn’t make a difference if it is a bar mitsvah boy who is reading or not, as it’s not about the Tzuras Ha’oisios, that only a sofer or a rav would know).
Rumor has it that in 770 after the Moshiach sefer Torah was finished and they started reading from it every week, the Rebbe mentioned that there are also other sifrei Torah in the Aron. From then on they would ask the Rebbe every week which Torah to use.
Therfore, it’s indeed appropriate (that after the first 4 weeks have passed) not to neglect the first Sefer Torah entirely, rather to make rotations.
In order to keep to the above mentioned minhag it’s advisable to have the rotation in such a way that the new Sefer Torah would be entirely read through within 2 or 3 years etc.###question 
  Should a Ba’al Koreh who is in middle of Pesukei Dzimra say the Kaddish after Krias Hatorah?

You should have the last oleh say it if there is no Avel or individual who has yortzeit.
Alternatively, it may be said by anyone in the minyan, preferably by one whose parents aren’t alive.###question

 1. I have a liquor store on my Mivtzoim route that I want to sell their Chometz for Pesach but they do not want to close for 8 days (they are not Shomer Shabbos at all). Could I do a normal Mechiras Chometz even if he will still be working in the store?.
 ###answer 
 2. There is a 3 way partnership all Jewish and one of them is the manager of the store do I need to get from all 3 of them Mechiras Chometz for the store or just the manager? (The other 2 do not work in the store).
Answers:
1. Mechiras Chometz should be done even if he will still be working in the store during Pesach. but you should tell them that they cannot use the Chometz during Pesach.
2. It would depend on the agreement between the partners;
If the manager has full control and right to do as he wishes with the store – he can sell the Chometz on behalf of the store.
If he cannot do as he wishes – all the partners have to give their consent to the Mechiras Chometz. If it is not possible for you to get in touch with the other partners, Mechiras Chometz should be done regardless.
The Halacha regarding the Chometz after Pesach depends on many factors and you should ask a separate question.###question

  I am leaving town Sunday and do not plan to be home all Pesach.

 ###answer 
 This is not an acceptable arrangement. You should not put yourself in a situation where you circumvent the need for checking for Chometz.
If you are already in such a situation, namely that you will not be in the first room after the time of Issur, you still will need to check the second room. However, this should be done without a Bracha.###question 
  Is an oven with Cook-time or Stop-time Mode acceptable for Shabbos use?.
 ###answer 
 There are many ovens on the market, and it is impossible in this short space to investigate and address every single model. The best we can do is provide a summary of the many issues to look out for. It is important that you read through the manuals of any model you are considering for purchase, in order to determine whether, and to what degree, the issues outlined below apply.
Thermostat:
The main problem with using a oven on Shabbos is the thermostat, which is affected by opening or closing the oven while the oven is on. When the oven door is opened, the thermostat will detect the cold air that rushes in and will activate the heating element if it is off at that moment. It is forbidden to cause this to occur, even if all the food will be removed all at once before the oven door is re-closed. [If the oven door is re-closed with some of the food remaining inside, there may be additional concerns of Bishul on Shabbos, depending on the circumstances.]  The thermostat is not a concern for Yom Tov use, but there are additional problems with a oven on Yom Tov as detailed below.
If the oven is off, like after the cook-time or stop time has finished this would not be an issue.
the problem with using such an oven on Yom Tov is primarily a practical one; most modern ovens have an auto shut-off feature that turns the oven off after around 6-12 hours. Yet another problem, applicable on both Shabbos and Yom Tov, is that many models have lights or fans that are activated and deactivated as the door is opened or closed. In summary, a modern oven without Sabbath Mode may be completely unusable on Shabbos and Yom Tov.
Ovens with “Sabbath Mode”:
Buying an oven with Sabbath Mode will alleviate many of these problems. Sabbath Mode will generally disable the oven’s display panel and any electronic controls, as well as disengage the fans and lights from being activated by opening and closing the oven door. The Sabbath Mode feature will also disable the auto shut-off feature. However, one very big problem, at least with regards to most models, is that the thermostat usually remains operative. [Some ovens have a light which illuminates when the heating element is on, in which case the oven could theoretically be opened when the light is on. However, it has been demonstrated through rigorous testing that these indicator lights are generally inaccurate, and may be illuminated even when the heating element is off.]
The thermostat does not present a problem for Yom Tov use, but makes it completely forbidden on Shabbos, according to most opinions. The outcome is that, ironically, the Sabbath Mode oven remains forbidden for Shabbos use, and is permitted only on Yom Tov. Perhaps it would have been more apt to name this feature “Yom Tov Mode”.
There is a practical workaround for Shabbos use that is easy and simple: Estimate about what time the main course will be served, and make sure that the oven turns off before then. This is generally easy to achieve, as the Sabbath Mode feature can usually be set to turn the oven off in any increment amount of time up until 72 or 96 hours. So, you can easily set the oven to go off after 2 or 3 hours, for example. Once the oven is off, opening the door does not create a problem with regards to the thermostat.
However, this method will usually create a new problem, which requires its own workaround. Now that the oven is off, this means that Sabbath Mode is now deactivated as well, and opening the door will turn the light on (if the oven has a light). This can be circumvented before Shabbos by manipulating the magnets or levers that detect whether the door is open. The specific manner of circumvention will vary from model to model, and in the case of magnetic detectors, may take some trial-and-error. Some oven doors are designed to be taken apart to allow proper cleaning of all the glass panes, and the magnet can be physically removed from the door. In other models, it may work to place a strong and thin magnet on the oven wall at the correct place.(The location of the oven’s magnet can usually be detected by sliding a paperclip around the top of the oven door.) These options may or may not work, depending on the model, so you would have to try before Shabbos, when you have the time and patience to troubleshoot it. [Note: Disabling the magnetic sensor only helps with regards to the functions controlled by the door sensor, such as the oven light and fans. However, the thermostat is not controlled by the door sensor, which is why the oven needs to be off before opening the door on Shabbos.]
Following the advice above, when Shabbos is followed by Yom Tov, one would have to choose whether to reserve the oven’s use for Shabbos or Yom Tov, as using it on Shabbos would require the oven to be set to turn off on Shabbos, in which case it will remain off for the duration of Yom Tov as well.
The Issur of Sheiyah with regards to an oven:
The above answer focuses purely on using the oven itself. However, there are also restrictions about which foods may be placed in an oven before Shabbos without a Blech, and much discussion about whether, and how, a Blech can be facilitated in an oven. Here is a brief summary of the issues:
From the Torah perspective, one may place food over an open flame before Shabbos in order that it cooks on Shabbos. Nevertheless, Chazal forbade this due to the concern that a person may come to stoke the fire on Shabbos in order to speed up the cooking process. This prohibition is knownas Shehiya.
One method of avoiding Shehiya is to cover the flames, typically with a Blech. Covering the fire indicates that one does not desire a strong flame, it diverts his attention from the fire, and it serves as a reminder not to increase the flames. With regards to an oven, there is a dispute whether – and how – a Blech can be adequately created. In practice, a Blech in an oven should be situated so that it covers the heating elements, which may be located either at the top of the oven, the bottom or the backwall. In many ovens, there are heating elements in all of these places.
Another way of addressing Shehiya, and to sidestep the need for a Blech, is to ensure that the food is cooked prior to Shabbos. It is sufficient if the food is already half cooked.  This fraction does not represent time, but rather, is qualitative and measured against the degree of cooking most people would regard as fully cooked. Nevertheless, for a number of reasons, it is best that the food be fully baked before Shabbos.
There is yet a third possible way to circumvent the prohibition of Shehiya. Chazal allowed one to put completely raw meat on an open flame just before the onset of Shabbos. They were not concerned that one might come to stoke the flames, because doing so would not serve any productive purpose – it would not ready the meat in time for the Friday night meal, nor would it be necessary to ready the meat in time for the Shabbos day meal. This leniency is known as “Kidra Chaysa” – literally: raw pot. (Indeed, some people may wish to put raw chicken and rice right before Shabbos to slow bake in the oven for the daytime Seudas Shabbos.)
In order for this leniency to apply, two criteria must be met. First, the food item must be one that takes a relatively long time to cook properly (such as meat). Second, the food must be put on the fire just before Shabbos, late enough that it will not begin cooking before Shabbos comes in. Some contemporary Poskim therefore assert that this leniency seldom applies nowadays, because most modern cooking appliances are able to cook in a relatively short amount of time. As a case in point, meat put up to cook rightat the  onset of Shabbos would usually be fit for consumption by the time the meat course  arrives. Even if the heat is set to low, this does not diminish the oven’s overall ability to bake quickly, because the seat heating can be easily raised. Thus, according to these Poskim, this option is not applicable to a modern oven.
Other associated issues:
1. It should be pointed out that even when the oven is off and cold, if it will be turned on with a Shabbos clock or a timer (see next point), one may not place inside any food which is not completely cooked. Furthermore, even completely cooked food that has cooled down may not be placed inside either, unless the food is completely dry (and will remain dry when heated). The same applies to an oven which will remain off but has  not yet cooled down.
2. With regards to Shabbos clocks in general, the Rebbe writes in a letter (Igros Kodesh Vol 12 page 192): “There are those who are extremely stringent and are even sceptical about the permissibility of using a Shabbos clock… Therefore, I am abstaining from giving this idea in an official capacity.” Even so, it is reported that the Rebbe instructed some individuals that they may be used (See Shulchan Menachem Volume 2 page 173).  At the same time, many authorities who permit Shabbos clocks in general nevertheless rule that they should not be used with regards to cooking specifically, for a number of reasons.

  In which tone should Shmoneh Esreh be recited?.
 ###answer 
 
Here is a quote from the Alter Rebbe’s Shulchan Aruch (OCH 101:2):
“One should not pray in his heart alone. Rather, he should articulate the words with his lips and whisper them audibly [the literal translation of the original would be: “make them heard by his ears”]. He should not, however, make his voice heard (by someone standing more than four cubits away), as it is written [regarding Chanh in I Shmuel 1:13] , “Only her lips were moving, but her voice was not heard.” A person who projects his voice during She­moneh Esreh is one of those whose faith is meager — as if the Holy One, blessed be He, would not hear a whispered prayer. (The Sages ordained that Shemoneh Esreh should be uttered in an absolute whisper, i.e., it should be heard by one’s own ears alone, so as not to embarrass transgressors who confess their sins when praying.)
Now, the Zoher and some Mekubalim (referenced in Likkutei Sichos vol. 35 in the Sicha (1) for Parshas Vayigash) hold that although one must verbalize his words, it should still be done completely quietly that even one himself shouldn’t hear himself. (This is because uncording to Kabbalah She­moneh Esreh is an expression of the highest level of Bittul where one’s entire being is completely nullified, thus his voice isn’t heard).
I have yet to find any reliable source which says that in this case we should follow the mekubalim, and there are Poskim (also brought by the Rebbe in that Sicha) who write that this instruction of the Arizal was a horoah l’yochid, and wasn’t directed to the public.
Therefore one should follow what is written in Shulchan Aruch.###question 
  Can a Sukkah be built under a screened enclosure?
Hi Rabbi Braun,
Someone moving to our community is looking into buying this house. They have a big sukkah and only place it will fit is in their backyard. The issue is that their whole backyard is screened. They want to know is they can build it under a screened enclosure.
I found this discussed in   ,  and he seems to say it’s fine. I’m not sure if his svoro/psak is correct. Is his psak accurate? Can it be done?
See attached pic of enclosure and the tshuva..
 ###answer 
 
Being that the screen is pasul for schach, that renders the area of schach directly under the screen invalid. One would therefore need to estimate that if one were to remove those areas of schach which is directly under each wire, whether the sukkah would still have more shade than sun.

  Are we allowed to take showers on a Three day Yom Tov?.
 ###answer 
 Firstly, the allowances given here to showering on Yom Tov is only when the following conditions are met:
a) One will assure not to run into the problem of  (squeezing) by their wet hair. That is to be careful from squeezing one’s hair from the washing till the drying. Therefore putting a soap or shampoo on the hair may not be done.
b) There is no allowance to use bar soaps since that is considered Me’machek (see Mishna Berurah 326:30). 
c) No fire can be lit or activated by turning on the shower faucet, therefore if the boiler was lit before Yom Tov that should help. However every case needs to be individually checked how the hot water system works in the shower.
Cold water shower on Yom Tov –
It is permissible to take a cold water shower (when fulfilling the conditions mentioned above) when a person is in great pain. See Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 326:1 & Alter Rebbe Shulchan Aruch ibid. The Alter Rebbe (ibid:6) concludes that it is the custom not to wash (bath in the outdoor lakes) even in cold water even when there is no prohibition attached to it. The Aruch Hashulchan (326:9) writes on this, “one who breaks this safeguard imposed by the Rishonim [custom of refraining from bathing in rivers, lakes and ponds] , on him it says ‘one who breaks the fence should be bitten by a snake’…”
With that said, the Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasa 14:11 (source is from Hagaos R. Akiva Eiger 326) brings that a person in pain may have a cold wash, the reasons is since if it is not in a lake, rather just a shower there are less concerns in Halacha.
One should not do this in a public setting like a mikvah. (People might not understand or think that one can also freely use hot water as well.) See Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 511:2.
Follow up Question on Showers on Yom Tov
Hot water shower on Yom Tov –
The Alter Rebbe (Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 511:1) after bringing a more lenient view, concludes that the custom follows like the view (Rema 511:2) that forbids one to wash his whole body in hot water that was heated on Yom Tov. This is since washing every day is not     (necessary for every person) and adds that even if it was heated before Yom Tov we still are to forbid the washing of the whole body by way of decree.
Today it is regular to shower daily, so some Poskim are lenient in extenuating circumstances (where cold water for some reason is not able to clean them) see Mishna Berurah (511:18) allows hot water even if it was heated on Yom Tov. However, as mentioned, the Alter Rebbe does not allow this. Therefore one can wash limb by limb in warm water. when the water is heated before Yom Tov. One should turn on the faucet to wash the face, hands and feet, and can keep the water on to continue washing the rest of the limbs. See Alter Rebbe ibid in the parenthesis.
Little children – 
As mentioned, the Alter Rebbe seems to be stringent (by way of custom even with little children who sometimes do not bathe every day), therefore it is best to wash a child limb by limb as mentioned above. If this is not possible, it seems that in extenuating circumstances for example the child could get bad rashes, one can rely on the Mishna Berurah (511:18) who allows to wash a child in hot water on Yom Tov. This would be if it is not possible to wash the little child limb by limb. The water would need to be heated before Yom Tov.###question 
 If a family is going away for Pesach and selling the whole house but has a non-religious son that will be staying in the house. Forcing him to leave will cause strife. He will probably eat some of the Chometz. Does this effect the validity of the sale?.
 ###answer 
 
They should have done Bedika and removed Chometz instead of selling.
Nonetheless, the sale is still valid.###question 
  If someone takes a plastic gallon of water and pours water into a cooking Cholent does the water bottle become Fleishig?
If they took the same water and poured it into the Keurig machine while cold is there any problem? The water being poured was always cold..
 ###answer 
 
If there was hot steam coming out of the Cholent when the water was poured (and still hot when reaching the bottle) then the bottle is Fleishig and this is a problem for the Keurig machine.
If though there was no hot steam coming out of the Cholent, then this poses no problem for the Keurig machine. Regarding the plastic bottle one should consider it Fleishig.

  If a Moisad (a shul) takes a loan from an individual does the Issur of Ribbis apply? Does it need a Heter Iska?.

2. Even then, this leniency applies only when there is no other readily available option, and the Mitzvah would otherwise not happen. However, in this case, it seems that a Hetter Iska can be arranged.
3. Even in cases where there is room for leniency, it is not unanimous whether the leniency applies from the perspective of the lender as well.###question

  Is one allowed to eat food that was left in a basket underneath a stroller while the baby was sleeping?.
 ###answer 
 The Alter Rebbe writes (Hilchos Shemiras Guf V’Nefesh 7) that one should not place a cooked dish or other foods or drinks under a bed because of the   (evil spirit) then rests on them even if they are covered in an iron box.
With that said, there is room for leniency  (after the fact) with food left underneath a stroller while the baby is sleeping in it for the following reasons:
Some Poskim hold that the reason of the evil spirit resting on the food (underneath a bed) is only when the bed belongs to one who if they would touch food it would cause impurity to the food if they did not first do Netilas Yadaim. Since there is some leniency (after the fact) with the touching of little babies without Netilas Yadaim (see Alter Rebbe Orach Chayim Mehadura Basra Shulchan Aruch 4:2) to food, that rule would say the same here as well. (Note, that the Alter Rebbe in the parenthesis adds that it is proper to be stringent from the touching of a child from his Bris Milah.)
The Darkei Teshuva (Yoreh Deah 116:137) brings that the problem of placing food underneath a bed is only when it is only the floor beneath it literally  ’ . This is not the case by a basket underneath a stroller.
The Darkei Teshuva ibid:138 brings the Sefer Mili Dichasidusa who holds that the problem of placing food under a bed is when there is marital relations on the bed.
Additionally, there are poskim that are always lenient in cases of bedieved.
Based on all these three reasons the Minchas Yitzchak (4:117) holds one can even be lenient even initially. However, it seems that based on the wording of the Alter Rebbe in both places (Shemiras Guf V’nefesh and Mehadura Basra) that one should be stringent at least initially.
Also, a stroller is not an ordinary bed. Its primary purpose is for taking a walk and short naps.
Thus, there is strong room to be lenient even initially and certainly after the fact.###question

What is our practice regarding personal Tefilos such as for Refuah, Shidduch, or Parnasa? I noticed in other Siddurim a Teffila that can be inserted by Refaenu, for example, where you can mention a specific name.
I have alopecia and I want to daven for hair.

Does it have to be in Lashon Hakodesh?
Can I just think about the request?.
 ###answer 
  
The correct place to make the request is in the Beracha of Shomeia Tefilla before the words “Ki Ata Shomeia Tefilas Kol Peh”. In addition you should have it in mind when reciting the Beracha of Refaeinu.
The request in the Beracha of Shomeia Tefilla should be said verbally and can be said in any language one is fluent in, preferably Loshon Hakodesh if he is fluent in it. The main thing is that it should come from the heart.
The request shouldn’t be said at every single tefillah in a set standardized nusach.###question

 if the entire city has indeed a minhag/psak to daven before shkia, can Chabad have a different psak/minhag?
Please advise me..
 ###answer 
  
There is a Machlokes HaPoskim if one may daven Mincha after Shkiah. The Alter Rebbe is of the position that we shouldn’t protest those who do daven after Shkiah. This doesn’t imply that it’s the right thing to do LeChatchillah.
Chassidim generally were very particular to ensure they finish Mincha before Shkiah. Notwithstanding the plethora of the Minyanim in 770, this is the right thing to do. There are unfortunately occasionally other minyanim in 770 which are not fully consistent with Zemanei Teffilah.
Even according to the position that one may daven after Shkiah, if faced with a choice of a Minyan after Shkiah or davening without a Minyan before Shkiah, some maintain that it’s better to daven B’Yechidus.
It is well known that the Rebbeim were so particular about this that they davened before Shkiah without a Minyan even when they had Yahrtzeit rather than davening after Shkiah. In the earlier years, the Rebbe did this several times too.
Certainly, in a place which has no such Minyanim this would be a breach of custom to introduce something like this, a matter which is highly questionable. There is a very simple solution to your situation: make it a habit of always coming on time to Shule. Your reluctance or difficulty to change your habit should not result in the community changing their standards and accommodating a behavior which is highly questionable.

  If my oven is set on a timer to keep food hot, can I open and close it on Shabbos while it’s still on?.
 ###answer 
 No.
When the oven door is opened, the thermostat will detect the cold air that rushes in and will activate the heating element if it is off at that moment. It is forbidden to cause this to occur, even if all the food will be removed all at once before the oven door is re-closed.
[If the oven door is re-closed with some of the food remaining inside, there may be additional concerns of Bishul on Shabbos, depending on the circumstances.]

Full Question:
Is there room to be lenient and not need to check a jacket that has no wool or linen stated on the tag, and most of the time I’ve ever check any jacket, it was Shatnez free?
Is there room to be lenient and not need to check my Kapotah that the merchant stated: “no one ever stated to have found shatnez in my Kaptotahs”?.
 ###answer 
 
About the jacket- I would recommend to check, because many times there is a problem with the stitching and the stuffing.
About the Kapotah- you must check each Kapotah individually.
Stories have shown that in some cases there was Shatnez even when the merchant said there isn’t, because it changes from cloth to cloth.

  I will be davening in a Shul that says Hallel/no Tachanun on Yom Yerushalayim. How Should I conduct myself?
Should Istill say Tachanun on my own while they say Hallel? Should I leave the room and say it? If I leave the room, do I put my head on my arm still?.
 ###answer 
 
It is highly advisable not to daven in such a Minyan on this day, even if it comes at the expense of Davening without a Minyan. It’s important on the one hand not to get into any type of Machlokes with the Minyan, and at the same time not to be perceived as one who is supportive of practices which are questionable.
If whatever reason you are already in such a situation, you should say Tachanun but in a manner that doesn’t call attention to your behavior.

Where & When Can Men Shave?###question 
  Is ripping toilet paper, not on the lines, permissible on Shabbos? If yes, why is it not under the Melacha of Korea? .
 ###answer 
 
One is not allowed to tear paper towels on shabbos, even not on the perforated line.
Regarding toilet paper, where no other other choice exists, one may rip the toilet paper, not on the perforated line.
It is recommended to rip the toilet paper with a Shinui. Ripping toilet paper with the left hand is not considered a Shinui.
This should not be relied on under ordinary circumstances; only where toilet paper was not prepared before Shabbos and it’s allowed only in order to preserve human dignity.
Reasoning:
The issue of ripping toilet paper isn’t a issue of Korea, since it’s one piece paper. Korea is a Melacha that only applies to items that are attached or sewn like clothes etc. there could be an issue of Mechatech, if it’s being ripped into a specific size. Even when not in a specific size there can be an issue – like in the above mentioned – of Tikun Kli, of fashioning an item for use. However, this can be permitted in a situation of K’vod HaBrios, specially if done with a Shinui – See below for an elaboration.

  Why do we cover our eyes only by Shema and not for any other Kavonos (Mitzvos)?.

There are other explanations according to Kabalah.
 ״ ״ ״ .###question 
  Is there any reason why women don’t do Mayim Achronim?.
 ###answer 
 Strictly speaking, there is no difference between men and women. Nonetheless, the custom has developed that women are lenient in this matter.
The suggested explanation for the leniency among women is because nowadays washing Mayim Acharonim is considered as a Chumra and women haven’t taken it upon their self.
More specifically, there are generally three reasons for washing Mayim Acharonim:
A concern for a particular type of salt which when touches the eye can cause blindness.
Because the hands are dirty from food and one may not Bentch reciting Hashem’s name with dirty hands.
According to Kabalah, the purpose of Mayim Acharonim is to give the “other side” (evil forces) a small portion of the meal so that they don’t prosecute against us.
The Poskim mention that there are those who are not accustomed to wash because this type of salt is no longer common. As for the dirty hands, since nowadays people are not particular to wash their hands after meals, thus this wouldn’t be considered an obstacle to Benching. An additional explanation (mentioned specifically with regards to women) is that they are careful to eat with spoons and forks, and their hands do not touch the actual food. As for the Kabbalistic reason, women generally are not accustomed to follow Kabbalistic practices. Therefore, since washing Mayim Acharonim nowadays is considered an extra stringency women have not adopted this practice.
Of course, the above is only an explanation of an existing custom common among women. Clearly, if a woman knows her hands are dirty she may not Bentch without washing her hands first. Even absent the dirty hands, it is recommended – but not obligatory – that woman always wash Mayim Acharonim, without calling attention to her practice.###question

  Is a woman permitted to tub bathe and/or swim on an Onas Prisha?
Rav Braun, I am writing to ask if you can please clarify the issue of tub bathing and swimming on an Onas Prisha – both Onah Beinonis and the other Onos (Haflagah and Chodesh).
We have been taught that this is not permitted lechatchilla (nor is internal washing) and if the need is great to swim or bathe (in tub, not shower) that one should ask a Rav, which usually results in being told to do a bedikah prior to swimming or tub bathing on an Onas Prisha.
Iwas told that some poskim hold that if a woman did tub bathe or swim (water reachinginternally, which is unavoidable in such cases) on an onah beinonis, on her own, then she would have to start sheva nekiim over again. The Alter Rebbe does not hold this way, and if a woman did do this, she would not have to begin her count again.
We would like to confirm the issue. Namely, is a woman permitted to tub bathe and/or swim on an Onas Prisha, and in particular on the Onah Beinonis (or a kavuah) at all, or is a bedikah required beforehand, or nothing is required and it is not an issue..

It is a Biblical prohibition for a Kohen to marry a woman who lived previously with a Goi, she is called a “Zonah” in the Torah.

 We wanted to know the halacha with regard to closing on a house purchase in the 3 weeks. And also once that is done with regard to moving into the house. If there is a time sensitive contract can we close it in the 3 weeks? And are we allowed to move houses in the three weeks/nine days?.
 ###answer 
 While some have the custom to try to be stringent in this matter since it is not a good siman   , according to halacha one may purchase a home during the 3 weeks to live in it. (See Mishna Berurah 551:12 regarding building a home). Certainly, if it will cause a loss of money, or if someone else might preempt (  ) and buy the property, one may do so. Even when these conditions don’t exist, If the home doesn’t legally become yours upon signing the contract till some time later, due to contingencies built into the contract, one may sign a contract in all cases.
Moving into a new home during the 9 days is not a good idea, in general there is an idea of celebrating and reciting a Shehechiyanu blessing when moving into a new home (even though it is not our custom) therefore it is not fitting to move in on these days. Levushei Mordechai (Orach Chayim 101).
Divrei Sofrim (R. Shmuel Sofer 47) writes that it is not proper to do a   during these days, even if the home is in the diaspora.

 I have seasonal allergies, during the week I put eye drops to calm the pain. On Shabbos I was not sure if I am allowed to. I did not put it in until the pain got really strong. Was I allowed to?.
 ###answer 
 
There are certain poskim that are lenient because you started the treatment before Shabbos. According to this opinion it’s was certainly ok. But preferably one should avoid relying on this.
If the pain is strong that it causes a general weakness, one may take medication regardless. If there is great pain but it doesn’t cause a general weakness, it should be done with a shinui, with the left hand for example.
If you put just clean water, it’s not a issue and you don’t need a shinui.

  How must a Shabbos key belt be worn? Must one wear it on top of sweater, jacket or blouse, or can it be hidden underneath and worn at the waist..
 ###answer 
 A shabbos key belt may be worn in any place that one sometimes wears a belt.
So for men since they wear a Bendel underneath their shirt, it is okay for them to wear on Shabbos underneath their shirt.
However a woman usually wears a belt on top of clothes. Therefore on top of her blouse is okay. So too, on top of blouse and underneath her sweater would be okay.
One more point to add: a Shabbos bendel may only be worn if there is no belt on the garment. If, however, there is already a belt on the blouse you can’t put a Shabbos bendel on it, but you can put a sweater on and put the Shabbos bendel on top of the sweater (if you wear a belt on sweaters on occasion).
In short: You may place a bendel on any garment that you usually put on it a belt. Only one is belt is allowed and not more.

Followup Question:
I recently saw that in Nittei Gavriel (Shabbos 1 88:8 and 72:17), he Paskens Lekula, bringing from many Poskim that the restriction only applies when someone lights the candles a long time before Shabbos, etc.
Also, in Kitzur Hilchos Shabbos Mishulchon Aruch Admur Hazaken (Simon 263 footnote 52) it is noted that it seems that the Alter Rebbe holds that the restriction only applies if lighting the Shabbos candles early..
 ###answer 
 
Obviously, the fact that other contemporary authors understand differently, isn’t an indication that this is necessarily correct. Also, it should be noted that Rabbi Zinner himself (Nitei Gavriel) brings Rabbi Alashvili Shlita’s Sefer Kitzur Halachos that you quoted.
Now, both have not paid attention to the Tehilla L’Dovid I’ve referenced. He proves convincingly that this is the case.
Second, Rabbi Zinner brings no other sources to support this view.
Thirdly, Rabbi Alashvili himself is in doubt about the matter and remains undecided.
Fourth, as explained earlier, it appears that this was a matter of doubt for the Alter Rebbe or a matter of Chiddush.
Either way, L’Maase he rules so in all cases.###question 
  When should one get his hair cut before Shavuos this year, since Erev Shavuos is Shabbos?.
 ###answer 
 It is a Mitzvah to have hair cut before every Yom Tov, so as not to enter into Yom Tov unkempt. The prohibition of haircutting on Chol Hamoed was instituted especially to compel people to receive a haircut prior to Yom Tov and not to postpone it.
The necessity of receiving a haircut on erev Shavuos is more acute, because haircutting was prohibited throughout Sefirah. The long hair accumulated over Sefirah causes a disheveled appearance, which is highly inappropriate for any Yom Tov.
Minhag Chabad is to take a haircut only on Erev Shavuos (this includes the preceding night). However, since Erev Shavuos coincides with Shabbos this year, we must cut our hair one day earlier, on erev Shabbos. In his  Kovetz, Rabbi Dvorkin writes: “It is obvious to me for a number of reasons that [when Erev Shavuos  coincides with Shabbos,] one should receive a haircut on Erev Shabbos. In fact, I did so myself. And just as the barber began to cut my hair, his telephone rang –  it was Rabbi Chodakov calling.

There has been extensive discussion whether this includes Thursday night as well. In practice, we may be lenient about this matter.###question 
  Can a woman Daven Shacharis past Chatzos? What does she do if she misses the time for Shacharis?
How about on Shabbos when the Amidah for Shabbos differs in each Tefillah? What should she do regarding Shachris and Musaf?
Additionally, on Shabbos, until what point can she eat in the morning? What if she didn’t get to daven at all, can she continue eating throughout the day without having to make Kiddush? (At what point does the obligation to make Kiddush take effect in relation to davening?).
 ###answer 
 
Although there is room to be Melamed Zechus on those women who are lenient to daven Shacharis after Chatzos, this shouldn’t be done, rather she should daven Mincha saying Shmomei Esrei twice. This applies even on Shabbos when the Tefilah for Shacharis differs from the Amidah for Mincha. However one can daven Musaf until night.
The reason Kiddush is made after davening is because before davening one is not allowed to eat. The prevalent custom is that even those that do eat before davening in order to be able to concentrate better during davening  (as is customary in Chabad), do not make Kiddush beforehand, but only after Shacharis (Musaf).
After Chatzos, the time for Shacharis has passed and one may not daven Shacharis anymore (Musaf could still be davened). Therefore, they would be obligated in Kiddush because the restriction of eating before davening no longer applies (since they are no longer obligated in Shacharis).###question 
  If I Daven after Chatzos on a regular Friday, do I say Tachnun?.

 1. One may not daven after Chatzos.
2. Tachanun isn’t recited Friday after Chatzos.###question 
  I crossed the dateline, traveling eastward (from Australia to California), during Sefira. What should I do regarding Shavuos?.
 ###answer 
 One who travelled east, observes Shavuos a day earlier than the people at his destination (i.e. on Shabbos and Sunday, the fifth and sixth of Sivan).
These Halachos are relevant for this situation:
Shabbos: This day is Yom-Tov for the traveller but not for the local populace. The traveller should recite the Yom Tov Tefillos and Kiddush (adding the selections for Shabbos), but omit the three words “Zman Matan Toraseinu”.
Sunday: This is the second day of Yom-Tov for the traveller but the first day for the local populace. The traveller observes Yom-Tov as usual, and he may include the three words “Zman Matan Toraseinu” in his Tefillos. At the end of this day, the traveller recites Havdallah in private.
Monday: This day is Yom-Tov for the local populace but weekday for the traveller. The traveller should don Tefillin and daven the weekday Tefillos. Other than that, he should not perform any Melocho, even in private.
Whenever the traveller’s Tefillos are at variance with those of the local populace, he should daven discreetly and not call attention to the fact.
See here for a complete overview of the relevant Halachos: Dateline 5779.###question 
 I live out of town and there is only one Ashkenaz Minyan that takes Shabbos in early at 7PM every week. At times, both Mincha and Maariv are after Plag HaMincha and before Shekia/Tzeis, which I understand is Tarti Desasri. Should I Daven Mincha Beyichidus before Plag and then join the Shul to listen to Chazoras Hashatz of Mincha and Daven Maariv with the Minyan, or Daven Mincha and Maariv Betzibur regardless?.
 ###answer 
 
You should daven Minchah with the Minyan and wait until after Tzeis to daven Maariv. However Kabolas Shabbos can be said with the Minyan.
See sources quoted here:
1. What would be preferred, to Daven Maariv early with a Minyan (in a case where one Davened Mincha after Plag), or to Daven Beychidus after Tzeis? 2. In general from what time can one start Davening Maariv Lechatchila?
Follow-up Question:
Will this delay the Seudas Shabbos? My wife and children would prefer to have an earlier meal. Tzais is around 9:25 this time of year. I understand it is Halachikly okay to start the meal early and be Mekabel Shabbos by Kiddush even before Maariv. Is this recommended?

 If I get pictures or videos (of a Seuda or Shul) that were taken on Shabbos by a non-Shomer Shabbos (or LeHavdil, a Goy), can I print/use/publicize them?.
 ###answer 
 
A Jew that is not Shomer Shabbos –
If it was a one-time event, and this picture would not be able to be taken after Shabbos, it would be Asur to benefit from it forever.
If this picture can be taken again but it happens to be that it was taken on Shabbos, it is Assur to benefit from it for the amount of time that it would take to take such a picture and after that it would be permitted to benefit from it.
A Goy –
If you assisted in taking the pictures (posed etc.) or he did it for you and it was a one time event, and this picture would not be able to be taken after Shabbos, it would be Asur to benefit from it forever.
If this picture can be taken again but it happens to be that it was taken on Shabbos, it is Assur to benefit from it for the amount of time that it would take to take such a picture and after that it would be permitted to benefit from it.

 It’s nothing specific to Lubavitch. Halacha mandates that the arm until the elbow should be properly covered. In a place where the common custom for women is to cover until the hand, it is part of Tznius to cover that as well. Some are stringent to cover the sleeves but this isn’t a requirement.

  Can a child tie Tzitzis for himself? Can he wear them after his Bar Mitzvah?
I am a melamed in 6th grade. I would like to teach the class how to tie tzitzis, and have every talmid tie tzitzis for themselves.
My question is, The boys are 12 years old, some will be Bar Mitzvah over the next few months and then they will be wearing tzitzis that they tied as a koton. Is this an issue?.
 ###answer 
 
Once a child reaches the age of Chinuch for the mitzvah of tzitzis he can tie his own tzitzis.
However, if they want to wear it after they are Bar Mitzvah it is important to make sure they were making it with the intention   . An adult must stand there to ensure that they do so.
Although this is considered a  situation, there are those who say that the tzitzis are still Kosher after they become Bar mitzvah. Others disagree. Therefore, it’s best to avoid using the Tzitzis after their Bar Mitzvah.###question 
  I didn’t see the moon (yet) tonight (Leil Yud daled). Tomorrow night I will be flying. What should I do if I see the moon on the plane, should I do it then or can I / should I push it off until the next night?.
 ###answer 
 If you see the moon on the plane, you should do Kiddush Levana, and not risk the chance of missing Kiddush Levana altogether.
Explanation:
The Minhag is that Kiddush Levana is not performed under a roof (OC 426:4). There are two reasons for this Minhag:
According to the Bach (OC 426), it is disrespectful when one does not make the effort to leave one’s home and go out to greet the king; how much more so when greeting the Shechinah. [It might be argued that this reason does not apply when in an airplane, where it is impossible to “go out and greet the king”, and staying inside is therefore not an act of disrespect.]
According to the Maharil (cited in Magen Avraham OC 426:14), the concern is that there might be Tumah within the building, and it is appropriate that one should greet the Shechinah in a place which is Tahor.
In any case, the Bach rules that this Minhag applies only where practical. In cases where it is not practical to go outdoors, such as an (even mildly) ill person who is housebound, or someone who is frightened of the reactions of the Gentiles, may recite Kiddush Levana at the window. The Bach’s ruling is brought down by the Taz (OC 426:4) and Magen Avraham (ibid) and other Achronim. The Magen Avraham provides another (more obvious) example – when the outdoors is filthy and not befitting the Bracha.
There is a further discussion in the Poskim whether one may view the moon from behind a (transparent glass or plastic) windowpane. The Pri Megadim (Mishbetzos Zahav OC 426:4) rules that one may do so when it is not possible to open the window, such as in your situation. The Birchei Yosef (OC 426:4) seems to conclude that it is unnecessary to open the window at all. [This particular issue is a far-ranging one in Halacha, and also concerns vision through glasses, but the common practice is to be lenient in this matter, especially when the pane is completely transparent.]###question

  Can a man co-found a company with a woman?
Is it halachically permissible for a man to co-found a company with a woman? Currently, the company is a startup that is expanding. Also is it permissible to work for that startup if it is only 1-2 people and would involve close interactions discussing business strategy and analysis etc? Most work would be done by computer but there would be business meetings etc..
 ###answer 
 
Permissible.
However, one must ensure not to violate the rules governing the interaction between men and women. This includes ensuring there is no Yichud, physical contact, flirtatious talk or behavior, excessive unnecessary conversation, and general lightheadedness.
Specific additional boundaries should be put in place to ensure that any such behaviors don’t happen. For example, not calling each other by the first name, etc.
It is advisable to receive advice from a seasoned and experienced Mashpia in these matters.

  Can a lady give a Shiur to men?
Full Question:
I run a lunch and learn in my office, the crowd is mixed and diverse, and we bring different speakers every week. It was suggested from our main sponsor to have a lady (who is fully Frum and Tznius) to give the Shiur/lecture. Is this permissible? Obviously, I am in a sensitive position. If the answer is in the negative, I would need to present it to the local rabbinic authority, and present the sources in Halacha..
 ###answer 
 
This is not proper for a religious crowd. Poskim advise against this. (Men need to look at the speaker, and to have men looking at a woman speak for a long period of time is not Tznius. We find in the Poskim that by the age of 9, it is important to have only male teachers).
Some poskim even forbid it outright.
(See Shaarei Yosher III: 21. Shevet Halevi 3:14. Mishnah Halachos 5:218. 11: 58. L’horos Nasan 1 EH 60:5. Igros Moshe OC 5: 12. See also ibid. 2:36).
However, if the crowd is not religious, and the purpose is to teach them Torah, there could be some room for leniency in very specific scenarios, and one should seek guidance from a Rav.###question

 Is he considered a Mechael Shabbos B’Farhesiya?
How can he fix it?
Is his wine Yayin Nesech?
Is he allowed to be a Chazzan in a Minyan?.
 ###answer 
 
Firstly, I should note that it is absolutely forbidden to do Melacha after sunset. As a measure of safety, one should always stop a bit before sunset.
If one has done Melacha after Shkiah, they need to undertake an appropriate Tikkun. They should discuss this with a Mashpia as well as putting measures in place to ensure this doesn’t happen ever again in the future.
Now to your questions about the individual:
It would be wrong to Passel (invalidate) a person without hearing his side and allowing him to respond to the accusations against him. Regardless, in this case, he isn’t considered a Mechalel Shabbos B’Farhesiya, his wine isn’t Yayin Nesech and he may be a Chazan.
It is strongly recommended to involve the rav or Mashpia of the shul in the matter.
If he indeed drives regularly after Shkiah even when told clearly, he should most likely not be relied upon in matters of kashrus. This would require determination from a local authority.

  A publication wants to print this letter and wants to know if you approve of it?
Do you approve of the following?
I recommend to consider that a couple getting married in their early twenties can expect to spend sixty years together, which is about five hundred thousand hours, and therefore should consider spending at least fifty hours getting to know their potential spouse before marrying them. Fifty hours is the equivalent of ten five hour dates and would only be one ten-thousandth of the time that they can expect to spend together. I think that it is obviously very unwise to marry someone without spending at least fifty hours getting to know them, and I recommend to go on at least ten five-hour dates before marrying someone..
 ###answer 
 
I don’t approve. Aside of the Hashkafah issues, there are some technical flaws in the logic here.
Couples don’t spend 24 hours a day together. That reduces your amount of hours significantly.
There is also no solid evidence that getting to know someone better, or for more time before marriage has bearing on the success rate of the marriage. Even if it does has bearing, as some argue, it’s obvious that serious commitment and shared goals are the ultimate influences on the durability of the marriage.
It should be noted that in many other circles they hardly see each other before marriage and they have a high success rate of lasting marriages. Historically, our ancestors who hardly dated also have a history of longer-lasting marriages.###question

 ###answer 
 Where there is no choice one may do it.###question 
  May one interrupt while reading Shnayim Mikra?.
 ###answer 
 The Alter Rebbe (OC 285:6) states that some are accustomed to read the entire week’ s Shnayim Mikra without interruption at all, but that according to the basic Halacha, one may interrupt it and read “one Parsha today . . and another Parsha tomorrow”. [In this context, Parsha refers to a segment of Pesukim in the Torah that appears without any space between the Pesukim, also known as  .]
This implies that if one does not wish to read the entire week’s Shnayim Mikra at once, he may interrupt only when there is a break in the Torah between Parshiyos.
From this it can be inferred that:
1. It is ideal to read the entire week’s Shnayim Mikra without interruption at all.
2. It is acceptable to pause when there is a break in the Torah between Parshiyos.
3. One should not interrupt within a Parsha at all.
Although point 3 is only implicit in the Alter Rebbe, the Mishna Brura (Shaar Hatziyon 285:11) states this explicitly.
It should be noted that obviously where necessary one may interrupt.###question 
  Being that it is difficult to understand Selichos in its original form, would it be better to read all or part of it in English or in a language which is easier understood? Would there be any difference between fast days and the Selichos before Rosh Hashana?.
 ###answer 
 Slichos (both of before Rosh Hashana and of a Taanis) is like any other part of Davening which one should understand what he is saying.
It is preferred that one should learn the meaning of the words of Slichos so he would understand it when he Davens in Loshon Hakodesh.
Alternatively, he can use a Selichos with translation on the side and pause before each paragraph and read with his eyes and then read the paragraph in Loshon Hakodesh after.
On the other hand, if for whatever reason one does not have an understanding of the words of Selichos, he should say the sections that he does not understand in English or any other language that he understands until he learns the meaning of the words, as Davening without Kavana is of little value.
It was the common custom for women who did not understand the words of Selichos to say it in the language that they understand, as when they say it in their own language it brings more concentration and feeling.
But men should say it in Loshon Hakodesh.
See here as well:

When reciting Hashem’s Name if translating in the middle of a Pasuk one should say “Hashem” and “Elokeinu” instead.
If one will certainly read the whole Pasuk at once one may say Hashem’s Name.

  Can my son work in a supermarket that has mostly non-kosher food?
There aren’t many summer jobs available for my young teenage son. Can he work in a supermarket where they have a nice kosher section, but it’s mostly non-kosher food? Are there certain jobs within such a place that are more or less desirable from a Torah perspective?.
 ###answer 
 
It is difficult to answer you properly without knowing you or your son’s religiosity background. In general, a boy in Yeshiva should learn or work in an Orthodox Jewish camp (a boys camp and not mixed with girls). A boy in Yeshiva should continue to learn Torah throughout the summer.
In any case, according to strict Halacha, one is allowed to work in such a market provided that he is not preparing cooked non-kosher food.
Regarding selling non-kosher food, since the Jew does not own the food and does not prepare the food there are many Poskim who hold that the prohibition of selling certain non-kosher food does not apply. There is no concern of possibly eating the non-kosher food when one is working in a market (and not a restaurant) where most of the foods are completely closed and can only be consumed when leaving the store.
However, this is not advisable unless one is pressed desperately for money. The biggest concerns would be possible fraternizing with women, Jewish or  non-Jewish, and possible Yichud situations.
Therefore it is highly advisable to try to find some sort of job in a Jewish camp as a first choice. It would be advisable to also consult with one’s local Rabbi or Mashpia.###question

 The exemption from fasting applies only to a woman who is already in the fourth month of pregnancy, or in the case of pain from 40 days onwards. However, if suffering from morning sickness, headache and/or general weakness one is exempt already from the beginning of the pregnancy.

  I print Chabad pamphlets for a Sefardi shul. Someone showed me today that according to Yalkut Yosef, if there is no Eruv, one should not leave pamphlets on Shabbos because it causes a stumbling block for those who still carry. Is this something I should consider also when the Eruv is down?.
 ###answer 
 There is different opinions on how much one must be concerned that people might carry because of you leaving pamphlets in shul. When there is a legitimate reason to think that people would carry the pamphlets home (like when the Eruv is down and they are used to carry these pamphlets home) you should refrain from putting out the pamphlets.
Another thing to consider is that wether or not it would be permitted, if the Shul follows the ruling of the Yalkut Yosef and he forbids to put out pamphlets when there is no Eruv, you should follow his view as well.###question

  Will people live forever after Techiyas Hameisim?.
 ###answer 
 The Pasuk in Yeshayahu1 says “the death will be swallowed up forever and Hashem will erase tears from all faces.” See Rashi on this verse where he says “death will be hidden forever.”
In Breishis Rabbah2 there is a dispute between the Tenaim if there will be eternal life after Techias Hameisim for the gentiles, but all opinions agree that the Jews will have everlasting life.3
The view of the Rambam4 is that eventually even after Techiyas Hameisim people will live a long life and eventually die. Virtually all views reject the Rambam’s view, namely the Ramban5 This is also the view of Kabbalah and Chassidus like the view of the Ramban and other Rishonim that life will be eternal after Techiyas Hameisim.6###question 
  Is one who finds it harmful to eat dairy permitted to eat chicken during the Nine Days?
I saw in Kitzur Shulchon Aruch (122:8) that one who finds it harmful to eat dairy they are permitted to eat meat of a chicken. Is this accurate? If yes, am I permitted to eat chicken as I am highly allergic to all dairy products to the extent where I carry an EpiPen where ever I go, G-d forbid I need it..
 ###answer 
 
That is correct.
The reason for abstaining from meat during the Nine Days is twofold:
Because meat is associated with joy.
Because meat is reminiscent of the Korbonos which were halted at the time of the Churban.
These reasons don’t apply to the same degree with regards to chicken – it is not associated to the same degree with joy, and because chicken was not offered up as a Korbon.
Although the Minhag is to abstain from chicken nonetheless, and there is absolutely no leniency for a healthy person, the Bach (552:2) and Magen Avraham (551:28) are lenient for a person to whom dairy is harmful. This is because abstaining from all dairy and all meat for a period of nine days would have a detrimental health effect (Shvus Yaakov §36), and is therefore allowed when needed (Oruch Hashulchan 551:24).
The concern of a detrimental health effect certainly loomed large in times bygone when the range of available food was relatively minimal. Therefore, in our times, when there is a wide range of high protein foods, it would be appropriate to avoid poultry as well if you are absolutely certain that this will not lead to detrimental health effects.###question

  What Brachah do I say when I see a River or an Ocean?.
 ###answer 
 Article: A Brachah on Rivers
The brachah of Oseh ma’aseh bereishis (thanking Hashem for the wonders of creation) should be recited when we see a large river that has been around since sheishes yemei breishis (the beginning of creation).
However, if the river has changed course, even if it happened biyedei shamayaim (due to a natural act from Above), we don’t say the brachah. When encountering a river, we needn’t be concerned that its course may have changed over time, but if it’s unknown whether the river dates back to sheishes yemei breishis, no brachah should be said. This is one of the reasons that this brachah is seldom recited, since the provenance of most rivers is unknown. Poskim say, though, that there is no concern with saying the brachah if we see very large rivers, such as the Mississippi.
None of the issues concerning rivers apply to oceans; we certainly should make a brachah when seeing an ocean. Upon seeing the “yam hagadol” (the ‘great ocean’), a special brachah, She’asah es (or Oseh) hayam hagadol, ought to be said. However, since we don’t know which ocean bears that name, we say Oseh maaseh breishis instead. Some maintain that the brachah for the yam hagadol should be recited when seeing any ocean which encircles continents, such as the Atlantic Ocean.
These Brachos are only recited once every 30 days.

Certainly the Mitzvah of rebuking a Jew who does not act proper applies today and is a Mitzvah in the Torah! See the Chinuch Mitzvah 239 for details of the Mitzvah.

  Why don’t we say Kaddish in Hebrew so that it is more easily understood? .
 ###answer 
 The saying of Kaddish in general and by a mourner, in particular, has great significance in Halacha and more so in Kabbala, which is beyond the scope of this answer. Nevertheless, I will give a brief explanation to answer your question:
Kaddish was originally written in Aramaic for a variety of reasons: so that the angels should not understand and become jealous of this special praise we give to Hashem; because it causes Hashem to remember the destruction of the Beis Hamikdash and we don’t want the angels to be aware of this and use the opportunity to speak negatively; because that used to be the common language spoken; according to the Zohar we are breaking the force of evil found in the secular language and utilizing it to praise Hashem. In any event, that’s the way it remained in our davening.

  A home, with a full Kosher kitchen, had Goyim working there as home attendants during a span of several years. Do all the dishes need to be Kasherd?
A home had goyim and not observant yidden working there as home attendants (one at a time) throughout the day and night during a span of several years.
In this home, there was a kosher kitchen with multiple cabinets and closets of many pots, pans, utensils, etc. In addition to the workers’ being instructed not to touch any dishes, throughout the years of this situation, there were always family members coming in and out at random hours of day and night checking up (although there may have been some shifts/days during which no family members came, but they were never informed if/when family would show up). Sometimes residing extremely close by.
In more recent times, there were also cameras installed. Despite that, there were several times (not many) which certain workers (of which there were various, different years brought different ones, but only one at a time) were caught using a utensil or about to use one. It remains unknown if there many other such instances in which they weren’t caught. Though it would have possibly been noticed if a utensil was left out.
Please note that they weren’t authorized to cook and so there was no cooking taking place. There was a kettle which they used to make hot drinks for the kosher patient and perhaps for their own food. But they weren’t usually seen eating hot food, so I’d assume they mostly dealt with cold. There are hundreds of utensils in this kitchen (not any unusual quantity, but a typical accumulation of a classic kosher kitchen). It is extremely unlikely that the vast majority of them were ever used by these workers.
The question now is the status of everything in the kitchen (the situation is no longer ongoing). Are the dishes all batul berov? Also, some of the cabinets/drawers looked like they were never handled though we can never know with certainty. The point being, if there was contact, some areas were more likely to have been accessed than others – if that’s a factor. Do they still need kashering? There are sets of china (and other utensils of non-kasherable material) as well.
Please advise your opinion on the matter. Sources would be appreciated. Thanks a lot!.

  Does Ma’aser need to be given on cash rewards/miles/points earned through your credit card?
The only way you can earn them is through spending money, is it considered earned money?.
 ###answer 
 
Miles:
If you can only use the points for very specific items you need not give maaser. However, if it gives you a broad purchasing power through your credit card it’s considered as a monetary gift and maaser must be given.
If it can only be used as miles (and the miles are not being exchanged for cash) or to reduce your credit card debt, maaser need not be given.
Ma’aser need not be separated from miles earned on a flight even if exchanged for cash, as it’s considered a rebate on the ticket.
Cashback:
One need not separate maaser from rebates, even if they are cash back rebates.
Points:
There are those who wish to make a distinction between various types of credit card points as follows: Credit card points received for purchases, whether per dollar or after reaching a certain threshold (say, $1000 within a specific time frame) would, in their opinion, be considered similar to a rebate. However, points that are received for referrals or sign-up bonuses for new accounts (if they’re not attached to spending a specific amount within a specified time frame) are deemed as income. Though it’s hard to justify this line of reasoning -see Hebrew references below- there is room to allow those who follow this opinion to continue doing so.###question 
 Me and my wife are starting a diet that eliminates all potential foods that can cause allergies, sensitivities, inflammations for 30 days. Among other things, we can’t consume alcohol, added sugar or any grains. I could see myself doing Kiddush on natural grape juice but I can’t think of what I can do regarding Chala. Any provisions or heters for 4 weeks?.
 ###answer 
 
Kiddush – order of preference: 
Hear kiddush from someone else and be yotze even without drinking.
Make kiddush yourself on grape juice and drink it.
Make kiddush on wine and have someone else drink it.
Challa
Although there is no alternative to baked goods from the 5 grains, you must still have “mokom seuda” in order to be yotze kiddush. This can be done by drinking an additional reviis of grape juice after kiddush. If this is too difficult you can be yotze with the reviis of kiddush. Obviously, whoever is not making kiddush will need to have their own reviis of grape juice for “mokom seuda“.###question 
  Is the kiddushin valid if one was too overwhelmed and didn’t have kavana while saying “harei at mekudeshes”?
I am very worried whether my kiddushin was valid, because when I said “harei at mekudeshes…” I was very overwhelmed and I don’t remember that I had the kavana of the words. Is it a problem?.
 ###answer 
 
Many Chasanim feel overwhelmed during the Chupa because of excitement, nervousness, and because of the holiness and life change which is taking place. It may be hard to remember now if you had kavana, but that does not in any way disqualify the kiddushin. So long as you were in a general good state of mind, there is nothing to be worried about.

 My wife had a shorter veses haflaga kavua. She has now established a longer veses haflaga kavua without three consecutive clean occasions at the shorter veses. What is the current status for the shorter veses kavua? Does she need to keep both, or just the longer? If just the longer, under what circumstances will the shorter resurrect? Upon one occurrence or three?
The basic point is that she first saw after 49 clean periods, and never had an opportunity to take that off the calendar because she always saw before then. Over the following years, she established a veses haflagah kavua for 48 clean periods. However, on 18 Tammuz in the day, she saw again after 49 periods, so that made two times for after 49 clean periods. in the next two months (Av and Elul) she saw after 47 clean periods, even earlier than the 48 veses kavua. In Tishrei she saw even earlier after 45 periods. Then in Cheshvon, she saw again after 49 periods, for the third time at after 49 periods.
So, to sum it up, she hadn’t seen three times clean after 48 without at least one occurrence of after 48 in the middle, but still saw three consecutive times after 49 clean when presented with that opportunity..
 ###answer 
 
The first haflagah of 49 became uprooted once she established the shorter veses kavua. Therefore she only has two haflagos of 49 and has not yet established a new kavua.###question 
  Can I take the Shabbos Elevator in the hospital to join the Minyan?
My husband is in Maimonides hospital, healing from surgery. Should he take the Shabbos elevator down to the Minyan or daven alone in his room?.
 ###answer 
 
Your husband may use the elevator (provided all buttons are pressed by a goy, of course).
If the elevator has a Hechsher he should definitely not Daven without a Minyan. Even if it has no Hechsher, there are strong arguments in favor of using the elevator over Davening without a Minyan. One who does so is acting correctly and cannot be faulted. At the same time, one who chooses to Daven alone over using such a Shabbos elevator is also acting correctly.

  Is there anything wrong with a picture of the two Luchos not touching each other?
I was once in a shul where the Luchos were divided. One on one side of the Aron and the other on the other side. A Lubavitcher Rov of the past generation (Rabbi Moshe Drazin) walked in and saw that, he made a protest and walked out. I am wondering what the source of that is.
Also, I have a logo with the Luchos and I am wondering if I should change it since they are not exactly straight and touching each other. Artistically the graphics person felt they would look more attractive on a slant.
Also at the top, the 2 Luchos are not touching. etc Is this a problem..
 ###answer 
 
From the Talmud, it is clear that the Luchos were completely straight and square (6×6 tefachim). It is also clear that they were touching; their designated place was in the Aron and they would touch each other while in the Aron.
As per the Rebbe’s instructions, pictures of the Luchos for a logo are made with them touching together, presumably, this is deliberate.
It does not make a difference on what angle the Luchos are drawn out, as long as they are accurate.

  Is it permissible to go paintball shooting?.
 ###answer 
 It is important to point out that if this is regarding a camp activity, then whatever written further below has no bearing on what should be done in camp. The purpose of this answer is not for staff members – in contrast to the director – to take this answer and make a Balagan in camp with it. The camp has their Rav who they ask their Shailos to, and that is what is to be followed in the camp B’Poel Mamosh. 
According to Halacha, one should not hit oneself nor shall he hit anyone else even if he gives permission, for it is not his body to give permission to hurt (and an Issur D’Oraysa might be involved).
Some Rabbonim permit paintball shooting as a school or camp activity to encourage learning and/or proper behavior (i.e. as a trip for for good learning) – similar to the concept of hitting a child to help his learning.
Others argue that it is only Assur to hurt someone if done in a harmful manner, however, since paintball shooting is done in a friendly manner there is no Issur involved. Nonetheless, this Heter should only be used if it is L’Toieles.
Indeed, tackle football is regularly played in many otherwise religious schools and camps. However, there is an obvious distinction since here there are guns used for shooting and hurting, while tackling is not officially to attack.
While these arguments might justify the Minhag to be lenient, there is strong room to adopt a stringent approach, as per the straightforward reading of Halacha (referenced below).
I would add that if we don’t steal the Afikoman, which is a Minhag because it involved stealing, even though it’s only a game, we definitely shouldn’t shoot other Yidden and hurt them, even as a game. It appears to be very against our Shito. As mentioned, camps must formulate a policy with their local Rav on this matter. It’s certainly against our Shita for staff members to decide on their own how to run the camp.###question

 ###answer 
 If it’s not noticeable that they are shatnez, they may not be given to a Goy due to a concern that the Goy may pass them on to a Yid.
P.S. In many cases the shatnez can be properly removed in a (halachically and professionally) qualified shatnez lab.###question 
  Is one allowed to say Birchos Ha’Shachar in the same clothes that he slept in? Can a woman Daven while wearing pajamas?.
 ###answer 
 A man or woman may do so, as long as they are dressed in a manner of tznius. Nonetheless, many chasidim are particular to wear a gartel.
If the clothes are respectful and clean, one may daven in the same clothes one slept in. Pajamas, however, would not be proper.
Generally, Poskim say that one shouldn’t sleep in one’s clothing.
Although this isn’t a halachic requirement, and clearly this isn’t the minhag, ideally, one should put on one garment, even a sweater or robe, that wasn’t worn by night for the reciting of the blessing of malbish arumim. One should also ideally wear leather shoes, if possible.
Likewise, a girdle, or pants for ozer yisroel and a head covering for oter yisroel. Women need not be concerned with arranging something for these two brachos.
Birchas Hatorah, is best recited with proper gear.###question

  On which side of the Mechitzah does a transgender man sit?
On which side of the Mechitzah does a transgender man (i.e., someone who was born a woman but identifies herself as a man) sit?.
 ###answer 
 
While there are different opinions among the Achronim about the status of a person who R”L goes through a transgender surgery, the consensus is that the individual retains their original status.
Regarding where to sit, she should sit in the women’s section dressed as a woman. Even if she doesn’t appear completely like a woman, it would be acceptable to sit there in this case.
On the other hand, sitting in the men’s section is Halachically problematic. Theoretically, since in such a case it wouldn’t cause Hirhurim to have her sitting at the men’s side, and it wouldn’t be a violation of Yichud, it could be acceptable – in theory – to do so. Nonetheless, there is a Maris Ayin issue.
Another equally important point is what people in the Shul will say if they know that there is a transgender man/woman sitting on their side of the Mechitza? Will a man or woman there be turned off from praying in the Shul? Likewise, will it somehow weaken the position of Halacha in this matter? Having a woman Daven in the men’s section is a public statement that while Hashem instructed one way, the individual is publicly choosing to act otherwise, and is publicly acting as a man in defiance of the way Hashem created them.
The Rebbe writes that synagogue issues depend on many details, including those who pray in the Shul and the way they will perceive it.
Therefore, with following the axiom of Chazal: “Always the right hand should draw closer and the left hand …”, it be advisable to explain to the person the problem  of them attending Shul services.
The options are to Daven in the women’s section dressed as a woman, or in the hallway.###question 
  Are the Chanterelle Mushrooms kosher? How are they to be checked for bugs?.
 ###answer 
 Chanterelle Mushrooms are kosher.
I am not familiar with a specific method to check these mushrooms for worms (which is very common in this type of mushrooms).
It is not suggested to use morel and oyster mushrooms because they are impractical to check as they have hard to see crevices.
All other mushrooms with smoother texture should be washed well under a direct stream of water and no further checking is necessary.###question

  I know that giving Tzedakah in merit of something specific is allowed –   , my question is, is this the ideal way of giving Tzedakah?
I’m asking because I’m working on a children’s project, and I’m wondering if it’s appropriate to mention to the children that this project was sponsored lizchus/leiloy nishmas… Should children be exposed to this concept? I’m asking min hadin and also darkei hachasidim..
 ###answer 
 
We are allowed to test Hashem with Tzedakah as opposed to other Mitzvos because Hashem guaranteed that we become rich from giving Maaser, as the Gemarah says   .
Accordingly, it is only permitted to test Hashem to see if we will receive money in return, whereas testing Him for someone’s recovery is forbidden.
However if one is not testing Hashem, rather giving it as a Zechus or segulah for someone’s recovery, it is permitted, as long as the giving isn’t conditional on the recovery.
There are sefarim that say that it is better to give Tzedakah sincerely without testing Hashem, however here it is just as a segulah, not a test. In addition it is important for children to learn the power of Tzedakah.

  What Bracha is a Chocolate Danish?
Does a Chocolate Danish you buy in the bakery have the Bracha (  and for   ect) as the Babka described here?.
 ###answer 
 
There is no one way that bakery Danishes are made, although there are plenty of bakeries that use other ingredients in a larger quantity than flour, one would have to inquire regarding each bakery and pastry on its own.
As a general rule, most Danishes have a high amount of sugar, cocoa, chocolate, eggs, oil, etc., aside from the fillings, and would normally qualify as mezonos even for a baal nefesh, unless one is kovea seuda, i.e. eats kedei sviah.###question 
  How to give Ma’aser if I can’t calculate the profit?
I have reached an age where I am required to withdraw money from pension plans (RMD). The monies were invested in various funds over many decades and the investments were bought and sold numerous times, and the pension plans changed as well over time. Since the transactions go back 30-40 years and the records are not kept for such a long time, my investment firm claims that it is not possible for them to calculate the profit. I cannot take ma’aser from the total withdrawal since I contributed my own funds all along to these retirement plans, and these amounts also varied over time. Is there any way to estimate ma’aser?.
 ###answer 
 
The mitzvah of tzedaka requires one to be more prudent and scrupulous compared to other mitzvos aseh, and to separate maaser at the earliest possible time.
When in doubt due to mishap, one must separate maaser from any moneys that one is certain that no maaser was separated.
However in this case it is advisable to go beyond the letter of the law. Thus, it’s proposed to separate maaser from all moneys in doubt. Therefore, you should separate until you are able to ascertain the amount that is for sure principle).
We are promised regarding the mitzvah of maaser that there will be no loss as Hashem will certainly pay you back.###question 
  Can one change the location of the oven while renovating their house?
1. I believe that it is mentioned in seforim that one should not move an oven in their home. Is this something that we follow? If someone wants to renovate their home and change the location of their oven, do they need to scrap their plans?
2. Would the same be true of a fireplace? Does it make a difference if it was never used or used very few times, or used often?.
 ###answer 
 
1. The common custom is not to be particular about ovens nowadays which aren’t fixed into the ground.
2. A fireplace which is not used for baking and cooking isn’t an issue.###question 
 I have a son who went on shlichus recently to a place where he does not have yet a minyan. He is very lonely on Shabbos and he’s asking me to come for Shabbos. I would love to go to him but are reluctant to go to a place without a minyan. What is the right thing for me to do? Also, he tries to go away for Shabbos as much as he can, but it’s very hard for him logistically to shlep with family to go often, what is the right thing for him to do?.
 ###answer 
 
Your son need not move away every Shabbos if it involves a great tircha. You may come for Shabbos in the case where your presence is deemed a great need, or if it is considered a mitzvah. Certainly, if you assist with shlichus activities over Shabbos there you may attend for Shabbos. In such a case, it is not only permissible but also commendable.
It should be noted that generally speaking the issues are the same for a weekday or Shabbos, although there is some room to argue that is a greater need on Shabbos and certainly on Yom Tov to Daven with a minyan.###question 
  Is one allowed to look at naked art in a museum?
Can you go into an art gallery and see statues of naked people or is that against Halakha?
What if you are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and you pass a statue of a naked person and you look have you done something wrong?.
 ###answer 
 
A man shouldn’t look at a non-tznius female. This applies even if it’s a picture or even just a sculpture.
There is an opinion that maintains that it is forbidden for a woman to recite Shema and daven in the presence of another naked woman. However, most other Poskim maintain that it is permissible provided the woman is in a sitting position. The Alter Rebbe seems to agree with the latter position.
Regardless, it is forbidden for a woman to look at a man, or even a woman, with intent for pleasure and for sure if the man or woman is not dressed properly. The same applies to a picture or statue.###question

  What is the minimum of Challah one can eat and still be able to wash & Bentch?
I try to keep the minhag of melave malka every week, including washing. Sometimes it’s hard to eat a lot after having eaten recently at the Shabbos meal…
What is the minimum of challah/Matzah one can eat and still be able to wash/bentch?
Over the years I’ve seen many different places where there is a weight amount or, worse yet, a description such as “kazayis” or “kabeitza” to describe food shiurim, and those leave a person very confused as to the exact amount of food. Would the Rav be so kind as to describe the size of a piece of challah or the amount of matzah (usually box Square Matzah)? (E.g. The amount of challah comparable to a golf ball or two golf balls etc or a different item that the challah could be measured against).
Additionally, does the shiur consist of only the hamotzi food, or could something that’s put on top of the challah/matzah also count as part of the shiur? (Let’s say if someone puts egg salad or tuna salad on challah, can this be counted and this way one eats let’s of the actual hamotzi food but can nevertheless still wash and bench).
And finally, is there a time frame in which one needs to eat the shiur?.
 ###answer 
 
One must wash (without a Bracha) and make Hamotzi for even the smallest amount.
One must wash with a Bracha if he’s planning on eating a K’beitza. This is approximately 2 K’zeizim. Each K’zayis should be eaten within K’dei Achilas Pras (= 4 minutes) and without pausing between the two of them.
One must make a Birchas Hamazon if he ate a K’zayis of bread within 4 minutes. Other foods do not count for this amount.
If 4 minutes proves to be too difficult, one can be lenient and eat it within 6 minutes but should eat approximately the size of 1/3 of a K’beitza within 4 minutes. If one is not sure if it was eaten in the right amount of time – if he is satiated, he should still make a Birchas Hamazon.
Torah measurements are usually volume-based, not weight. A K’zayis is the approximate volume of half an average size egg. A K’beizah is the volume of an average size egg. Nonetheless, for simplicity, they have been converted to weight measurements, although the weight measurements are far from accurate. This is because different foods with an equal volume weigh differently. The following is the weight for water; bread and certainly matzah weighs less. For a K’beitza this is approx. 53.8 gram or 1.89 oz. For a K’zayis, approx. 25.6 gram or 0.90 oz.
One-third of a standard square machine matza is approximately a K’zayis. With bread, it is harder to measure, as they are not uniform but it is approximately the size of what would fit into a small l’chaim cup. In order to be safe, one should err on the side of caution and eat slightly more than the shiur, due to a number of reasons, among them since some crumbs remain between the teeth.

  Why are men not allowed to wear jewelry?.
 ###answer 
 In a place where it is common that men, including religious men, wear rings there isn’t really an issue. However, in a place where men do not wear rings, this can be a serious concern of lo yilbash, a Torah violation of dressing with female ornaments.
Additionally, one must always take into account the local custom; one may never breach what is locally acceptable. At times, violation of local mores can be as severe as breaking Torah law.
An additional issue is the prohibition of chukos hagoyim. This includes any non-Jewish mode of behavior which has no ta’am (logical basis) or to’eles (obvious benefit)—and when a Jew performs them they are acting solely to imitate what is in vogue. Even behaviors which have an appreciable rhyme or reason, if it’s a conduct that is derech pritzus, shachatz v’gaavah ([an aspect of] immodesty or pretentiousness) is forbidden; the Toras Kohanim also includes elegant dress associated with the non-Jewish elite.
According to one interpretation, it includes any mode of conduct that was initiated by non-Jews and gained widespread popularity before Jews adopted this behavior.
Even when none of these issues are present, we want to seriously consider why they wish to wear jewelry and whether this stems from a place of kedusha, or this is simply the desire of nefesh habahamis; she uses even matters that are permissible to lure one in her net.

  Should one set up advanced security measures in their Chabad house?
Should one set up advanced security measures (guards, weapons, training, etc.) in their shul/Chabad house? Included in this question: there is already a Mezuzah. Why doesn’t that offer enough protection? And if it does, why would one need to take such measures?.
 ###answer 
 
I’ll start off with an anecdote:
A man was stuck on his rooftop in a flood. He was praying to G-d for help.
Soon a man in a rowboat came by and the fellow shouted to the man on the roof, “jump in, I can save you.” The stranded man shouted back, “no, it’s OK, I’m praying to G-d and he is going to save me.” So the rowboat went on.
Then a motorboat came by. The fellow in the motorboat shouted, “jump in, I can save you.” To this the stranded man said, “No thanks, I’m praying to G-d and he is going to save me. I have faith.” So the motorboat went on.
Then a helicopter came by and the pilot shouted down, “Grab this rope and I will lift you to safety.” To this the stranded man again replied, “No thanks, I’m praying to G-d and he is going to save me. I have faith.” So the helicopter reluctantly flew away.
Soon the water rose above the rooftop and the man drowned. He went “upstairs”. He finally got his chance to discuss this whole situation with G-d, at which point he exclaimed, “I had faith in you but you didn’t save me, you let me drown. I don’t understand why!”
To this G-d replied, “I sent you a rowboat and a motorboat and a helicopter, what more did you expect?”
And now to answer your question:
The Torah instructs us to protect our lives in every way possible, spiritual and physical. Obviously, in the event of physical danger r”l, in addition to applying spiritual protection, we must do all we can to protect ourselves in a physical way, following standard security procedures. (This should be discussed with the local security agencies, police department, etc., in conjunction with the local Rav/Shliach).
One can ask the same question regarding Hashem’s protection in general: we are promised that “the guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps”. Should that mean that we should not apply physical protection as well? Should a Jewish soldier not wear a helmet? Obviously not.
So too in regards to mezuzah: we are taught that the mitzvah of mezuzah brings longevity to those who keep it, and even more –  it provides protection to the house and its residents (even when they are outside of the house), and to all Yidden throughout the world. However, in the event of physical danger r”l, we must apply physical protection in addition to making sure we have kosher mezuzahs affixed to our doorposts. This does not in any way imply that the mezuza is an insufficient measure of protection, rather, that Hashem will help our standard security procedures in the merit of the mezuza.
We find a similar idea regarding parnasa: while the Torah teaches us that it is Hashem’s blessing which gives a person parnasa, everyone understands that this blessing needs a “vessel” in which to rest. For someone to say that he won’t work because he is relying on Hashem’s Bracha is foolish and wrong. So too we must take natural measures in security issues, and one who refrains from doing this is held responsible.
A story to illustrate: there was a chosid who experienced a break-in to his vehicle and asked the Rebbe (amongst other things) if he should check his mezuzas. The Rebbe answered that he should make sure the vehicle is locked at night.###question 
  Is it permissible to mix essential oils of the Ketores ingredients (Myrr, galbanum, etc.) in an inexact way? I want to smell what the Ketores smells like as a way to “live with the Geula”..
 ###answer 
 Even if one makes a very little amount of Ketores but with the same proportions as prescribed in Chazal, he is violating a Torah prohibition and is punished with the penalty of kores. According to some opinions, it is prohibited even if one does not use all 11 spices. Even if one uses other spices but the four key spices – tzari, tziporen, chelbnah and levonah – are the same as written in the Torah, using the same proportions, it is prohibited. Others maintain that even if  all 11 spices are different,  as long as these are spices whose smoke rises upward (or, according to one opinion, it potentially can rise straight) and produce smell it is prohibited if done with the same proportions as the formal Ketores.
This however may be done if you change the proportions of the various different spices. It is not sufficient to change the amounts; the actual proportions must be different.
As an aside, I fail I understand the need for doing this in order to live with Geulah. The way to live with redemption has been taught to us by our sages, namely, studying portions of Torah dealing with Moshiach and redemption, conducting ourselves in thought speech and action as appropriate for such special times etc.  there’s no need to come up with our own creative ideas and reinvent the wheel.

[When done with a skinny gartel it is very tight, and when done with a larger gartel it is a bit looser, but still quite tight, and the intent here is to allow to walk a long distance in the gartel and not have it slip.]
I saw some Poskim (Darkei Teshuva) allows even a short-term double knot on a gartel, but it appears that Poskim do not accept this if it is tight.]

  What is the criteria for determining whether to say Tefilas Haderech?
Question: 
What is the criteria for determining whether to say tefilas haderech? We are taking a 3-hour drive to Connecticut, some of it is mountains. But like every minute (maybe a drop less or a drop more) I see a house or a few houses..
 ###answer 
  
Tefilas haderech should be recited if a person travels at least a parsah (approximately 2.4 miles) past iburah shel ir (the outskirts of the city). Iburah shel ir is equivalent to approximately 108 ft. after the last house of the city.
It is difficult to define the precise definition of a city and a village, but it is certain that individual homes are not even a village, but a city with many residents and permanent businesses throughout the year, and schools are considered a city. But for tefilas haderech, maybe even less than that could be considered a city.
Once a person leaves that vicinity, even if there are houses along the way, one should say tefilas haderech.

  Is the human placenta Kosher?
Hi, I am Chabad, and I have a birthing class, and it came up few times in the class about women eating their placenta after birth. Some eat fresh and some have company encapsulating. So, I would like to know if there is any Jewish source for this custom? What is the halachic ruling pertaining to this for a healthy delivery vs. some issues with iron levels in the mother to blood loss, etc?.
 ###answer 
 
Scientifically: It is highly debatable whether scientifically there is any health advantage to this practice. See for example here.
Halachicly: I’ll focus only on the halachic aspect. Eating placenta per se is problematic according to Halacha as human flesh is forbidden to be eaten. It might also fall under the category of mi’us. (Note that customarily placenta used to be buried – certainly not eaten).
A leniency could be justified only for sick people who need medication. Nonetheless, when ground and encapsulated there is more room for leniency.
However, being that this isn’t a “recognized cure” (refuah yeduah) it’s not so lchatchillah. If there are other alternatives available, or if it’s not really that important, one shouldn’t use this method.###question

During shmone esrei – one may not interrupt, and should not stop or cover their eyes.###question 
  Are Potato Chips/Pringles with an OU Fine?.
 ###answer 
 Potato chips – fried potato chips should be Bishul Yisroel. However steam cooked potato chips do not need to be exclusively bishul Yisroel.
Pringles – there is a Machlokes in regards to regular Potato chips if they need to be Bishul Yisroel and one should be stringent as mentioned, however, even according to the lenient opinion, there is room to be more stringent in regards to pringles.
Reasoning:
Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh Deah 113:1) requires Bishul Yisroel only on foods that are Oleh Al Shulchan Melachim (that would be served at the meals of royalty).
The Chachmas Adom 66:4 writes that foods like potato cuttings require to be Bishul Yisroel.
Although most opinions maintain that we define Oleh al Shulchan Melachim solely by the fact how it is served right now (if it is fit for a meal of royalty), since a fried potato would require to be bishul Yisroel, the potato chip should also be bishul Yisroel,
despite the fact that it is cut thin.
This would be analogous to a piece of meat: one cannot say that only certain cuts of meat that are fancy require Bishul Yisroel and non-fancy cuts of meat do not require Bishul Yisroel.
However If the potato chips are steam cooked, it does not require to be bishul Yisroel (see Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 113:13).
Pringles made from potato starch or potato flour – if the potato was cooked first it would have needed to be bishul Yisroel before it was turned into potato starch.
Therefore, Pringles are different than potato chips since during the process they were already cooked like regular potatoes even though they are dried afterward. Thus, it is problematic even for those who would argue that potato chips are fine, since the original Issur when it was cooked by a non-Jew remains. (Those who allow it use certain leniencies and some claim it’s better than potato chips.)

  Is it permissible (Halachically/Hashkaficlly) to take my kids to Walt Disney in Orlando?.
 ###answer 
 It hard to say there is something Halachicly forbidden about this. However, it definitely is not something I would recommend.
The general atmosphere in theme parks are not in line with the chassidishe atmosphere, including the music, the shows, and the whole experience.
In Disney parks there are many characters from movies, and the parked is “themed” around the movies. I would definitely consider this to be inappropriate and uneducational. (Some characters are also non Kosher animals, such as Mickey Mouse.)
An additional but equally important point (particularly relevant for the summer time): theme parks is a place where there is a strong level of immodesty, regarding how people act and dress. This might actually be an halachic issue.
The following is what Rabbonei Chabad have stated on this matter (    ״):
Regarding a theme park: while it is quite inappropriate for boys to go to a place where the women dress in a non tznius manner, and it is not recommended for girls to go to a place where there are non-tznius men, a decision needs to be made on a case by case basis.
Being that it is a matter of standard, I would recommend to discuss this matter over with your personal Mashpia.###question

  Is one allowed to be on an “entertaining” WhatsApp group where sometimes the Admin shares videos and voice notes that contain Lashon Hora, Harassment to other Yidden, mocking of Rabonim etc.?.
 ###answer 
 If this is the sole purpose of the WhatsApp group, obviously it is absolutely forbidden.
Even if the WhatsApp group contains other “kosher” entertainment, and one has the practical ability to skip over all the forbidden sections (which needs to be properly determined if this is at all practically possible), one may not rely on one’s temerity that they will avoid reading or viewing the un-kosher sections, unless this is their only necessary outlet for such “kosher” entertainment.
As a general principle: Wherever one has a choice to avoid situations where they might confront negative thoughts or behaviors, they are obligated to do so according to Halacha. In cases where this is the only method available for them to receive that which they require, then they may use this channel but must avoid doing (viewing, reading etc.) that which is forbidden.
This principle applies also to walking down the street in a place where one knows in advance that they will encounter immodest sights.
Of course, none of this takes into account the serious issue of Bittul Torah, which is a separate matter altogether. We are obviously discussing a case where for whatever reason this issue is not relevant.

Here is the link to the Frum slate site: Eretzhakodesh.org.
 ###answer 
 
There are several issues at play here and we will attempt to analyze them one by one.
Endorsement of a secular organization:
Though voting is somewhat of an endorsement of the organization at large, it appears to me that this is the same as voting for Knesset, which has been encouraged by virtually all gedolei Yisroel. I have subsequently heard the same opinion from another contemporary Posek who shared with me his position as above.
This is very different to joining the Synagogue council of America, something which was banned by gedolei Yisroel, as it indicates a recognition of movements who deny the creeds of our faith, among them the authenticity of Torah. The key distinction is that this organization is purely a secular organization and contains no religious significance whatsoever.###question 
  Does one need to ask a Rav before being induced? Is there any Halachic issue?.
 ###answer 
 
This matter is discussed in a number of Poskim. The general rule is that one may not induce or rush the onset of labor unless there are clear medical reasons to require it. Some of the reasons for this prohibition are because:
There is a level of risk inherent to childbirth, and one should therefore not hasten it even though it is bound to come.
The special assurance of protection Hashem provides at the time of childbirth does not necessarily apply to the same degree if the birth is hastened without a clear medical need.
The procedures and/or medicines involved in induction can themselves cause complications, and one should not take that risk needlessly.###question

  How to properly reward children for their good behavior?
When rewarding good behavior, Is it at all oisgehalten to choose certain missions that are mandatory, meaning if they miss those mandatory ones, they will not get rewarded for the other (non-mandatory) missions? I know that we always tell people on mivtzoim “even though you just ate non-Kosher it’s irrelevant whether or not to put on tefillin now”.
My question is when it comes to chinuch does that same rule apply?.
 ###answer 
 
You may choose whichever system works for you or for the purpose you’re trying to achieve. Furthermore, there might be a particular advantage in using the system that you have outlined. A reward system by nature indicates that what the child is doing is something extra, not required. When you start rewarding for behaviors which are expected from the children it subtly implies that these behaviors are not obligatory behaviors. For example, we don’t normally reward children for keeping Shabbos. If we have a reward system for observing Tznius, we are implying that tznius is an extra unnecessary commitment.###question

Some are concerned that we don’t have sufficient information about the leavening process of spelt and therefore it should be avoided unless absolutely required for health reasons.

  May I use Maaser to buy Mishloach Manos to give my students?.
 ###answer 
 One is obligated to send two Manos to at least one person. This obligation cannot be fulfilled with money from maiser.
The same applies if there is a cultural, communal or institutional expectation that you give your students – it may not be given from maiser.
Also, if one already committed mentally to give these extra Mishloach Manos from their money, they may not later decide to use maaser money.
If one is accustomed (for three years) to be particular in being mehader to give extra Mishloach Manos (to a certain amount of people) it becomes a binding vow and maaser money may not be used.
In all other cases, if one wants to add onto the basic obligation, and send to another two more people (but not more), it is considered a voluntary mitzvah and maiser money may be used, provided that one cannot afford otherwise to pay for it and that the mishloach manos is reasonable and not extravagant.
It should be noted that this addition is considered a hiddur mitzvah. If one is choosing a hiddur, It would appear that it’s much more mehudar to give this money for poor people instead.###question 
  Is one allowed to eat Hamotzie before Davening?.
 ###answer 
 There is a prohibition to Kovaya Seuda before davening in case they might forget to daven before the zman tefilla, however, one is allowed to snack on fruits and other foods and eat bread or mezonos up to a beitza (2 kzaysim).
Before Shacharis, one may not eat at all. If not eating disturbs one’s kavanah in davening, one may be lenient to eat before Shacharis. Chassidim would be particular to eat before Shacharis in such cases. But since the purpose was not to be kovaya seudah they would ordinarily eat mezonos and not bread. Bichlal, one may not eat more than a kebeitza. Generally, Mashpiim in Lubavitch preferred mezonos over bread.
Q. Is there a difference between men and women?
A. There is room to be meikel for a woman since there is an opinion that woman can fulfill their chiyuv of Tefilla with a short bakasha, a request of Hashem, in the morning.###question

״  .###question 
  Article: Do I have to fast?.
 ###answer 
 The most stringent of all fast days is Yom Kippur, since fasting is min haTorah (a Biblical law), as the passuk in Parashas Acharei Mos says: “Ta’anu es nafshoseichem” (afflict your souls)—and the severe punishment for not fasting is kareis (early death by Divine decree). Only a heter (dispensation) dispensed by a rav in critical circumstances and in a strictly prescribed manner would allow breaking the fast. A choleh she’ein bo sakanah (a person who has a non-life threatening illness) and similarly, a woman who is expecting or nursing (under normal circumstances), must fast.
Four other fasts are rooted in divrei kabbalah (the words of receiving, i.e. from the Prophets): Tzom Gedaliah, Asara B’Teves, Shiva’a Asar B’Tammuz and Tisha B’Av, and they are subject to stricter rules than for other laws mi’d’rabbanan (of Rabbinic origin). (Taanis Esther is in a different category of minhag—custom.)
Tisha B’Av, due to its history of huchpalu bo tzaros (double tragedies), is more stringently observed: We begin fasting at sunset the evening before and observe the additional bodily afflictions as on Yom Kippur. But the other three fasts of divrei kabbalah are more minor; they were instituted for calamities associated with the churban (destruction [of the Temple]) and during times of relative peace afterwards were commemorated only as a standing tradition previously accepted by Klal Yisroel (the Jewish people).
One of the leniencies of these three fasts is that an expectant or nursing mother who is mitzta’eres harbeh (in much physical discomfort) does not have to fast. Poskim state that lav davka (not necessarily) must the discomfort be acute—even some difficulty suffices as a heter. By contrast, a choleh she’ein bo sakanah, and similarly, an expectant or nursing mother who is suffering undue weakness or one who is at a stage of her pregnancy where fasting is deemed unhealthy for her (or for the fetus) and would therefore be considered a choleh—is patur (exempt) from fasting on all four fast days, including Tisha B’Av.
A mother of small children who is not expecting or nursing is not included in this heter, and neither is one who is paid to care for others’ children, as there is hardly a career or calling that exempts an individual from the halachic obligation to fast. One halachic opinion states that women should not have to fast for twenty four months after giving birth (the official halachic time span for nursing) and another exempts all those of childbearing age, but these views are rejected by mainstream poskim.
There is some extra leniency regarding Tzom Gedaliah (compared to the other two fasts of divrei kabbalah) for those who are not otherwise exempt, but would not be physically able to fast on Yom Kippur only one week after fasting on Tzom Gedaliah. In such a case, a rav should be consulted.

  Is there a possible problem with using pots and pans that having a non stick coating?.
 ###answer 
 New (without a Hechsher):
There is no Halachic problem with new Teflon pots (after Kashering them – see link below)
Some, however, have a Hiddur to avoid using new Teflon pots for Pesach. Some even avoid using it throughout the year too. These are not Halachically mandated.
Used:
If they were used for Treif, they should not be Kashered.
Similarly, if they were used throughout the year for Chometz, they should not be Kashered and may not be used for Pesach.###question 
 As things look, it seems we may need to be making Pesach at home this year. Since Mikvaos are closed, how can we go about doing tevilas kelim for the new utensils we buy?.
 ###answer 
 
For the time being, if there are no places available to tovel keilim, one can give to a non Jew and then borrow it from them. This exempts the dishes from tevilah for the time being. This is not a solution long-term. After such time that it becomes possible to immerse the dishes, one should do so without a blessing.

  Are we to avoid the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers and disinfectants for Pesach under the current COVID-19 climate, with the assumption that some of these products may be grain-based in origin?.
 ###answer 
 One must ensure soaps or hand sanitizers don’t contain alcohol. All sanitizers not containing alcohol may be used on Pesach.
Even if it does contain alcohol if its not denatured ethyl alcohol or if its made in North America it may be used on Pesach.
However, if nothing else is available, one may be lenient regardless due to the current circumstances and be careful to rinse their hands with cold water before touching food.###question 
  Can one take a cold shower in place of a Mikva on Shabbos? Can this also be allowed for kedusha yesira (Tosefes Tahara) and not just Tevillas Ezra?.
 ###answer 
 One may take a cold shower on shabbos for the purpose of 9 Kabin or Tosefes Tahara.
One must ensure that he is not violating the issur of sechita (squeezing) when drying his hair. One must also ensure that when turning on the cold shower no water enters the heating system.
Note that according to some, 9 Kabin does not achieve Tosefes Tahara.  Another option (for Tosefes Tahara only) would be to learn a perek of Mishnayos in Maseches Mikvaos.

My child goes to playgroup and we pay at the beginning of every month. Due to the coronavirus, my child is at home and not going to the playgroup. The teacher from our playgroup still wants us to pay even though our child isn’t even going. Do I have any obligation to pay?.
 ###answer 
 
(Firstly, this response is only on a general level and various technicalities can change the result of the answer. For example one needs to see what was written on the contract of the school. One needs to see if there was a “force of majeure” stipulation in place, it might also depend if and how much the school is providing online services and projects.)
Because there’s so many factors that can influence the decision in this case and also because there are multiple opinions on this matter, in the absence of a properly scheduled DIn Torah, it is appropriate to reach some compromise between the parties. This is the advice that Batei Dinim all over the world are telling people.
One suggested compromise: March should be paid in full (especially if one already paid for the month).
For the month of April, one will have to see how the situation evolves. If the school will not open, and no services are provided, one should pay a partial amount. (There is room for a school to expect “Pesach vacation pay” in addition to full March, this matter should properly considered by way of a mutual compromise agreement.)
It should be noted that it is very likely that if one does not pay the expected amount that the school is asking, the school might not accept the students afterwards. They could be in the right by doing so. This is an important point to consider.
If one already prepaid for months after Pesach, different rules might apply.
Reasoning:
Firstly, since the schools were running as usual for the first half of March, there is no question that they should get regular payment for the first half. For the second half of the month, if one already paid for the month, it is proper not to demand for any money back.
If one did not yet pay for the month of March, then it is proper to reach a  (that both parties agree upon as fair) and also pay something for the missed time, this is especially if the school is trying to provide schooling programs online and projects.
However, in this unique situation, since a school usually gets paid Pesach vacation, this should be considered as well. Whether one were to give for the second half of March or for the first half of April it still comes to the same amount of a full tuition month of March. Thus, the month of March should in this situation be paid in full.
After Pesach (for the month of April and onward) many maintain that there is no obligation to pay provided that the agreement is only month by month payment agreements, unless the school will reopen Be’ezras Hashem.
By the letter of the law, when work seizes due to unforeseen circumstances, the loss is on the worker or provider. See Rema Choshen Mishpat 334:1 & Taz, & Nesivos Hamishpat 334:1.
However, see the seemingly contradictory Rema in 321:1 who rules that the loss is on the “Baal Habayis” and not the worker. See the Aruch Hashulchan (Choshen Mishpat 334:10) who attempts to answer the seemingly contradiction of the Rema (from 334 and 321) that in 334:1 where the worker looses discusses when he chose to stop when he could of technically continued through great diligence. Whereas in 321:1 the Rema discusses when there is no way at all to continue working. This is also the view of the Maharam Paduah cited in the Shach 334:3 that in such a case where the government does not allow the teachers to work. (The latter seems more fitting with the corona virus pandemic situation.)
As a general rule, when two sides are in dispute of who needs to pay and the Halacha has various opinions and sides, we would consider the possibility of  (the one who currently has the money) has the upper hand in the dispute.###question

  Can I get a manicure / pedicure / eyebrows waxed in 9 days?.
 ###answer 
 All three should be avoided this week.
Cutting nails this week is a Machlokes. Every manicure and pedicure involves filing which is considered cutting. Since it’s more than plain cutting as it’s beautification, and it can be delayed, it should be avoided. Same with eyebrow waxing which many poskim consider like a haircut.

  I put a 2/3 down payment on my credit card for a Pesach program in Israel. Due to the medical rules, the program is cancelled. Does the organizer owe me the down payment back? Can I negotiate to apply the down payment towards a greater share in next year’s program (e.g. 4/5, or complete) or is it a problem of ribis?.
 ###answer 
 This response is only on a general level and various technicalities can change the result of the answer. For example one needs to see what was written on the contract. One needs to see if there was a “force of majeure” stipulation in place.
Because there’s so many factors that can influence the decision in this case and also because there are multiple opinions on this matter, in the absence of a properly scheduled Din Torah, it is appropriate to reach some compromise between the parties. This is the advice that Batei Dinim all of the world are telling people.

  My gas stove is the type that lights itself as soon as you begin to turn the knob, it then goes from High to Low. Can I turn it on on Yom Tov or would I have to turn on from before Yom Tov?.
 ###answer 
 You can skip the “ignite” by going straight to high/low and lighting with a match. Alternatively (and preferably), you can pull out the plug and light with a match. Either way, you must remember that it is forbidden to lower the flame, so you need to turn to the right setting before placing the match near the burner (-the knobs usually turn from high to low). You would need to light the match from a pre-existing flame, such as a yartzeit candle.###question 
 I was asked on Mivtzoim if it’s OK to smoke marijuana on Pesach or there’s a problem with it?.
 ###answer 
 
For ingesting marijuana:
If it’s medical marijuana that a Dr. prescribed for an ill individual, and it’s a pill then it would be allowed.
However if not, it poses a halachic problem. Besides for the issue of kitniyos, it would need to have a Hechsher like any vitamin, as it’s made with a variety of ingredients which need to be verified that they are kosher in general, and for pesach specifically,
For smoking or injecting marijuana:
Hard to use the specific term kosher (fit for a Jew) to eat since it is not kosher for a Jew to smoke or inject marijuana, for the following reasons:

  Is Quinoa Kosher for Pesach?
I am very confused about this. All the years I’ve heard that most poskim maintain that quinoa is considered kitniyos. Now I am hearing that there is new information on the topic and that is been agreed that it is not kitniyos.
May I use it on Pesach or not?.
 ###answer 
 
The common consensus of most poskim on this topic is that it is considered kitniyos for all practical purposes. The few kashrus agencies that are authorizing it are pushing this product on the market—and even they maintain that it needs a reliable proper hechsher as it might have some grain mixed into it—but that does not change the consensus within mainstream halacha.
Explanation:
The key argument to permit quinoa is that this is considered a new type of food which wasn’t around when the decree against kitniyos was made and thus it is not included in the original prohibition against kitniyos.
This argument has been repeated many times about different things. However, klal Yisroel has not accepted this argument. The custom is not to use peanuts, and more specifically — corn, even though these foods were not around then.
In fact, the original poskim who mentioned the prohibition against kitniyos do not list the various type of foods. The basic assumption is that anything that has the properties of kitniyos is included. Furthermore, from the extensive discussion in poskim about why potatoes are permitted on Pesach it is clear that the fact that this was a new food was not germane to the discussion.
Quinoa has all the properties of kitniyos and all the reasons mentioned in poskim apply just as much if not more to quinoa. Certainly, it has more similarity to grain than corn does.
It should be noted that even though Rabbi Moshe Feinstein has ruled to permit peanuts, he agreed that corn remains forbidden. His son Rabbi Dovid Feinstein states clearly that the same applies to quinoa. (The arguments to distinguish between corn and quinoa based on its Yiddish name and its high popularity are a far stretch and inconsistent with the position of Reb Moshe himself. It is obvious that Reb Moshe’s position to allow peanuts is not based on the sole factor of it being a new food. He explained elsewhere why corn remains forbidden because it fits well with the general criteria of kitniyos, unlike potatoes and peanuts. Accordingly, in his opinion quinoa should be forbidden. As mentioned this is also the position of his son, Reb Dovid.)
The classification of quinoa as kitniyos applies also the other areas in halacha. With regard to the rules of kilayim for example, it is clear that quinoa is considered kitniyos. There’s no reason to make any distinction when it comes to this very important minhag, which many poskim, including the Tzemach Tzedek, state that it applies even during times of hunger. A proper understanding of the Alter Rebbe words in Shulchan Aruch leads us to this conclusion too.
To the best of my knowledge this is also the position of most Chabad Rabbonim the world over. The position that quinoa is unacceptable as kitniyos is shared by many many contemporary poskim. To name just a few: Rabbi Elyashiv, Rabbi Neubort, Rabbi Shlomo Miller, Rabbi Usher Weiss, Rabbi Westheim — and many other well known kashrus agencies. (For a through treatmet of this matter, see Kovetz Etz Chaim, vol. XXVIII).
The very fact that all those who permit quinoa warn strongly to use it only if it goes through a proper certification process because of the serious concern that it might have a mixture of other grains is telling. Indeed, one of the reasons for the original prohibition against kitniyos is this very fact that it often mixes with other grain.
In conclusion: there’s no reason to change our behavior this year than all previous years. The minhag to forbid kitniyos is an important one and should not be dropped for convenience reasons, without a consensus that a particular food isn’t included. There are many other alternatives for healthy food on the market for Pesach.###question

All three options are absolutely forbidden for all.
Some have irresponsibly promoted this idea without verifying with with poskim. Some individuals in the original group who conceived of this idea have backed off too. Some made it very clear that what they said was tentative if it receives an agreement from contemporary poskim. This idea has no basis in halacha and should not be considered of at all.###question

  We don’t have enough wine for the Seder. What should we do?
We are Shluchim on a small island. A week ago the government made alcohol sales illegal and shut down supermarkets, we are not allowed to leave our home at all. They did this without any notice and we hadn’t yet bought our wine. We did however have 1 bottle of wine that someone had given us a while ago. It’s 750 ml, and won’t be enough for ’  for both my wife and I, for both nights. Can I dilute it? If yes, by how much, it’s 4% alcohol. We don’t have grape juice or any other alternative as the supermarkets are complete shut..
 ###answer 
 
A bottle of 750 ml contains close to 9 revi’is , i.e. about 9 cups of wine. If you drink only the majority of the cups, you should have much more left. Since the wine is pagum, you must first add more wine to it. For the last cup you must drink an entire revi’is in order to make al hagefen and you can exempt your wife – who will only drink majority of the cup – with the beracha.
You can also add a bit of water so long as it serveable as wine and would normally be drunk as wine.
If you still don’t have enough you can substitute the wine with coffee and tea.
You should preferably use the wine  for the 1st cup of Kiddush and 3rd cup for birchas hamazon.

  If a Jew owns vending machines around the city, is there a problem on Shabbos if people buy from the machine?.
 ###answer 
 No.###question 
 We are writing a Sefer Torah and we would like to keep it in our house when it is done. What are the Halachos about that? We do not have a specific shul to give it to right now.
What are the rules of keeping a Sefer Torah in the house if we won’t really be using it for Krias HaTorah generally?.
 ###answer 
 
Firstly, keep in mind that a shul you choose to give the Torah to is only considered a “loan” and you may take it back whenever you want. Also the traditional celebration “Hachnasos Sefer Torah” is usually done when the Torah is going to be brought to a shul so it can be read from in Minyanim.
In any case, the following is the guidelines to having a Sefer Torah in a home:
One must have a designated and set place for the Sefer Torah. This place should not be in a couples bedroom nor should it be in a room directly under a bathroom or a couples bedroom. If the Sefer Torah is in your home temporary, you may be lenient and keep the Sefer Torah in a room directly under the bedroom (if there is a real need); however, you should still be careful not to keep it under a bathroom.
Since one must act respectful and may not turn your back and the like in front of a Sefer Torah, the Torah should be put in a Aron Kodesh or a cabinet with doors which are 32 inches tall and it is best to add a second partition (a solid one, not a paroches/curtain, unless you fasten also the bottom of the curtain in a way which would prevent it from moving), however this is not an obligation. There is also a custom to have a curtain in front of the Aron Kodesh.
It is customary for the Torah to be in an upright position (standing, as opposed to lying down).
If at the time of the torahs arrival one does not yet have a partition etc. with which to cover the sefer torah as explained above, then the torah should be wrapped in two covers (or taleisim) for the time being, at least 32 inches off the ground on a shelf that is at least 13 inches by 13 inches wide.###question 
 Since only the Ba’al Koreh stands on his porch, does he say the Brochos for all Aliyos by himself, or can he say them on behalf of people standing on other porches (B’Shlichus)? If so, what’s the preferred way?.
 ###answer 
 While AskTheRav and the Beis Din of Crown Heights will no longer be giving recommendations regarding what activities are encouraged or discouraged due to the current Covid-19 pandemic, we’ve been informed that professional and reliable medical advisors allow now others receiving Aliyos under very specific guidelines. The reply below assumes this is not the case or that the guidelines are not feasible in your case.
Please see the Beis Din’s letter here for more details.
He should say the Brochos for all Aliyos by himself. There is no such thing as a Ba’al Koreh saying the Brachos on behalf of other people. As well as distant Aliyos (given from far) are not acceptable. See Badatz letter.###question

 ###answer 
 
Generally, you can kasher from treif, but lechatichila we don’t kasher from milchig to fleishig. In this case, as you don’t remember whether it was used for milchig, it is okay to kasher from potential milchig. (Kashering is done through    )

  As l work in my house or walk in my neighborhood l can hear minyanim that are saying kaddish, borchu or chazoras hashatz. Do l have to stop to answer?.
 ###answer 
 There is an obligation to answer Amen whenever one hears any Beracha. You do not need to stop to listen to chazoras hashatz when walking outside, but if you hear a Beracha you should answer. Also no need to answer Borchu, Kaddish, etc. (it’s a good idea to answer at least once for the mitzva).

  Is it permitted to eat in a fenced in backyard on Shabbos and Yom Tov?.
 ###answer 
 This is allowed; however, the following should be kept in mind:
1. You should preferably light the candles on the table where you are eating. If this is not practical, you can light inside but someone should eat something (a snack) near the candles while they are burning. It is still better to have 2 candles on the actual table where you are eating.
2. Kiddush needs to be at the place of the meal. One cannot make kiddush in the house and then eat in the yard, or vice-versa, even if they had this in mind.
3. Watering plants is forbidden. great care must be taken not to spill any water on the grass, especially while washing hands (also mayim achronim). one should be careful even with other liquids. For this reason the Alter Rebbe writes that its best not to eat on grass if water will be handled (it seems that this only applies if real water will be used).
4. One may not pour liquid on soft earth.
5. You should also make sure an eiruv chatziros was done, if needed.###question 
 I’m trying to calculate the correct measurement for Hafroshas Challah, in this article you convert the volume measurement of kabeitzah into weight, but if we stick with volume, can we say a beizah is about 75ml, therefore 43 1/5 bz = 3456 ml = 3.65 quart ?
Calculating in volume is useful for me especially when making sourdough and the amount of flour may be in the safek bracha range but with added starter dough you can clearly end up with maybe a 5-quart bowl full of dough after you’ve mixed everything and ready to take challah.. that would be with a bracha, yes?.
 ###answer 
 
I’m not sure what you are trying to say and accomplish. The shiur for challa is in the FLOUR not the Dough. In other words, although the challa is separated only after the dough is made, you need a shiur of flour before all the added ingredients. The reason why we commonly convert it to weight is because most flours are sold by weight. However, different varieties of flour (whole wheat, spelt etc.) have different weight vs volume conversion ratios. Other factors that will influence the conversion ration include temperature, moisture, storage. Sometimes it is advisable to measure by volume and not weight, or to calculate the conversion based on your particular flour.
I hope this clarifies things a bit, please reply if you need more help understanding the halacha.
Follow-up:
Thank you for your response. Yes, that makes more sense.
But how do we sourdough? where you have starter… here is a typical example:
You “feed” the starter dough the night before baking with an amount of flour, less than 1lb, but let’s say 3/4lb but may be as little as 100 grams. Then the next day, you may take 3lbs flour and mix it with about 50% of the above starter dough — this may yield that 5-quart dough.
Does the flour added the night before and, in the starter, add to the flour we use before baking to taking challah?
Answer:
The flour that you add the night before does add up. The flour in the starter dough only adds up if it was made by a Yid and challa was not separated from it yet. If not, and there is a shiur in the new dough, one should combine the 2 doughs, and separate challa only from the “new” dough.

 Often it’s possible to cause a bee to fly out through an open door or window without capturing or hurting it.
As the bee is not dangerous, it is not allowed to kill it. However, one can catch it if the bee is biting him, or even if it’s on his clothes and about to bite him (if it is difficult to remove by shaking the cloth).
If one is allergic to bees, one may trap it.

  Can a few women split the daily Chitas between themselves?
Is it ok and considered fulfilled to split chitas of the day with more than one person. I so badly want to fulfill the Rebbes Hora’ah especially with everything that’s going on in the world and to bring Moshiach. But chitas is too long for me to actually do while raising my kids etc. I had in mind to make a WhatsApp group to divide it between other women. Would that be considered fulfilling the chitas?.
 ###answer 
 
The takana to learn chitas is on an individual basis, where everyone will finish the Chumash and Tanya throughout the year. And the Tehillim on a monthly basis.
Splitting up the chitas is not the ideal method, since you as an individual will not have completed the above. There is however some merit in it, since you, as part of a group, will have it completed (similar to the division of Shas has done on 19 Kislev, although as noted, this was not the original takana of chitas).
I suggest that in addition to splitting it among your friends, you also try to learn just the Chumash without Rashi, or to cover a certain amount throughout the day and complete the rest at a later point.The same can be with Tehilim (first kapital) and Tanya.###question 
  Is it OK to sleep with ones feet towards the door?.
 ###answer 
 There is no mention in halacha about sleeping with one’s feet facing the door, however, some people have a custom not to do so based on the fact that is the position a dead person faces in the chevra kadisha. If this is not a family minhag, you don’t have to be worried about it.###question 
  If one used his cup for Mayim Achronim, may he drink the remaining liquid after Benching?.
 ###answer 
 One may drink the water left in his cup that was used for Mayim Acharonim. Nonetheless, some people are particular about this.
This refers only to the cup from which the water was poured. However one should not drink the leftover water in the cup into which the water was poured and many are particular not to use at all unless rinsed very well.###question 
 I borrowed a flashlight from a friend and I used it too much till it died, so I bought new batteries to return. Is there a problem with ribbis since there will be more power in the batteries than when he lent it to me? What is the best way to proceed?.
 ###answer 
 
It is not a problem.###question 
  When and how can women greet men?.
 ###answer 
 Q. I taught my students the Sicha about shlomis bas divri – how she greeted and spoke to everybody. We know that a woman isn’t allowed to greet a man, what are the exact halachos? What about family/family friends? Can the students say good morning to the security guard out of mentchlichkait? What if it is someone respectable?
A. A man or woman may not create closeness    with a man through asking how the other is doing and other types of indirect affection.
However, one may say ‘Hello’ or ‘good morning’ since this is generally interpreted as a form of ‘social norms’ which is not showing even indirect affection.
Nonetheless one should always be aware of the issue to ensure that no problems ever ensue. The Yam Shel Shlomo (Kiddushin 4:25) writes that a man, depending on his inclination and how he knows himself, can weigh how he should speak with women.
The laws of tznius conduct applies also to family (and friends) with the exclusion of siblings, parents and grandparents.###question 
  Are you allowed to go fishing, if you will throw the fish back in the water or not eat it?.
 ###answer 
 The Torah forbids us from acting cruel to animals, including fish, and/or causing them pain.
Fishing causes pain to the fish that are caught, as the hook pierces the mouth of the fish. Sometimes this injury can prevent the fish from being able to eat, causing more pain and death.
While we are permitted to cause (necessary) harm to an animal in the process of preparing them to be eaten, “catch and release” is prohibited for the above reason.
P.S. The above is regarding fishing as a sport. If it is being done for the purpose of eating, or even for therapeutic reasons, a Rov should be consulted as how to do it in the best way.###question 
  Can I Throw-out Cheesecake in Garbage?
The shliach in my area gave the whole community cheesecake, I prefer not to have it in my house since it makes people in my family sick with all the cheese and sugar. If I can’t find someone to give it to, can I throw it in the garbage?.
 ###answer 
 
If you can’t give it to someone else, then you can put it in a bag and then throw it in the garbage.###question 
  Can I use a private street Eruv?
Full Question:
This Shabbos an Eruv was constructed by a few of my neighbors. The Eruv was constructed in front of a number of houses, and included the sidewalk in front of these houses. It was built, in order to make it easier for people to carry their Siddurim, to participate in a porch Minyan on their block.
I know the Rabbonim have prohibited using an Eruv in our community, for various reasons. Is a sidewalk Eruv also problematic?
Although it was created for current use, it’s probable the Eruv will stay up indefinitely.
Can I use this Eruv?.
 ###answer 
 
The Beis Din does not approve of such an Eruv unless it would have an actual fence with doors.
Additionally, making an Eruv on a public sidewalk is not allowed since the area belongs to the city.###question 
  May one watch the “Patterns Of Evidence” series?
 ”   ”,
“Patterns Of Evidence” is a heavily advertised series of videos and books. In short, it is ran by Christians who go on missions to present evidence for the episodes in the . This includes, evidence for  ,    and the sinking of the walls of  amongst other episodes. Filmmakers scoured the areas that   and    are believed to have taken place, and they dig in the ground, dive in to water, collect earth, search for footprints etc. to present evidence for the occurrences that are recorded in the .
For example; I have not watched any of the episodes, but I heard that they scoured the , and found in middle of the  an area where there were twelve wells of water, and seventy palm trees. I cannot confirm this because I did not watch any of the episodes, but, from what I heard, this is the type of investigative research that they do.
Though it is led by Christians, they do not seem to present any “evidence” for anything that is recorded in the “new testament”. It seems to be purely films to provide evidence for the “old testament”. I could not find any mention of   on their website. In fact, it took me some time to discover that it is even led by Christians.
In fact, in their “about us” page, they describe themselves as follows:
“Guided by curiosity and an unflinching desire to uncover the truth, documentary filmmaker Timothy Mahoney embarked on a search for evidence – archaeological, scientific, and even literary – that would shed light on whether the events chronicled in the Bible really happened or not. What do the world’s leading archaeologists and biblical scholars have to say about these questions? Were ancient Israelites really held in bondage in Egypt? Did Moses really lead them out to the Promised Land? Did the walls of Jericho really come tumbling down? Is there any truth to these stories?
The results of this amazing 12-year investigation may change the way the world will view history and the Bible”.
My question to the  is;
Given that we live in an era when  in general, and the historical episodes in the  in particular are mocked and ridiculed in an unprecedented manner, and what more, we are all exposed to the mockery wherever we turn, would it be permissible for a  to watch these films and / or read these books, to strengthen his  and confidence in the ?
Thank you.
 ###answer 
 
From what I’ve been told there are clear traces of  in the film.
Since this is the case, it is not proper to watch or recommend for watching these documentaries. The movies would require proper rabbinical supervision to know which ones are deemed appropriate for personal viewing.###question 
 We are traveling upstate to stay in a bungalow house. I expect us to stay there for 1-2 weeks, and we might do this a few times this summer. In other words, I don’t expect us to be staying there for 30+ days at once. Is there a need for a mezuzah? And if there isn’t, can mezuzahs be put up anyway for extra protection?.
 ###answer 
 
If the bungalow house is owned by you, you need to place mezuzahs all year around.
If the bungalow is rented, and you stay less than 30 days, a mezuzah is not required according to halacha. However, the Rebbe advised someone to have a mezuzah near his bed (with a double cover if needed). For that reason, some people take with them mezuzah for protection even in places that the mezuzah is not required.###question 
 It’s known that a man should not say hello to a woman. What if she said hello to me, what do I do? And is a man allowed to say hello to his niece and sister in-law?.
 ###answer 
 
In a place where the custom is to say hello to a women, it is commendable to say hello as well as reply to greetings, as this is not a greeting that contains any promiscuity, or affection, and on the contrary may result in a desecration of G-d’s name.
In a place where it’s not the custom, its prohibited to say hello, as this is a portrayal of affection, replying should be respectful and curt.
To family members (sister-in-law, niece) one may say hello, and speak work related speech only, and minimizing small talk as this leads to issues.

  Should I be washing my baby Negel Vasser properly?
Full Question:
I read on AskTheRav that the Alter Rebbe says that since the Bris one who doesn’t allow your baby to touch food without Negel Vasser is considered holy. (See here)
We’ve been washing my baby Negel Vasser since he was born. Since he is so little and moves around many times his Negel Vasser doesn’t cover the whole hand and is not done perfectly. Also he sleeps multiple times a day.
Do I need to wash him every time he wakes up and make sure it’s a perfect Negel Vasser before he touches food?
In other words what is the age where I have to actually begin worrying about the tumah on his hands and be stringent, as opposed to now, when it’s more preferable and more for Chinuch?.
 ###answer 
 
If you are accepting upon yourself this added stringency, you should ensure that the baby washes Negel Vasser exactly as an adult should, and make sure water reaches the entire hands.
However, this stringency does not necessarily include washing after every times your baby naps, as even food that is touched by an adult who takes a nap by day is permitted to be eaten.
For those who do not take on this added stringency, Halacha mandates to be careful regarding touching before Negel Vasser for a child who has reached the age of Chinuch, approximately 6 or 7 years old.
To add clarification, this Hiddur mentioned in Poskim isn’t due to the Mitzvah of Chinuch. Although as Chassidim we know that Chinuch starts from the youngest age – and even earlier, Halachically, Chinuch doesn’t start until a child is already “the age of Chinuch”. Thus, even according to those opinions that things done for Chinuch can be done ‘symbolically’ without all the details (a subject of itself with many parameters), this Hiddur when observed should be kept with all the details.###question 
  If I said Shnayim Mikrah a week early, (I.e. on Shavuos I said Parshas Naso), was I Yotze?.
 ###answer 
 According to Halacha, yes. You may begin from Sunday a portion of the Parasha that was read Shabbos Mincha.
Nonetheless, according to Kabbalah it should be read only on Friday, the day before the entire Parasha is read from the Torah.###question 
  Is there a source that states it is better to specifically use challos made from white flour for Shabbos?.
 ###answer 
 Poskim do bring that one should make an effort to use kemach yafa (white flour) when baking challahs, in order to honor Shabbos.
It is OK to use whole grain flour because of health reasons.###question 
  If I had to interrupt after putting on Teffilin Shel Yad, should I now answer to all “lower level” devarim shebikdusha?
If I had to interrupt (to say Kedusha for example) in between putting on Teffilin Shel Yad and Shel Rosh and therefore must say an additional Bracha, do I revert to no longer answering “lower-level” devarim shebikdusha (like the amen on Chonen Hada’as), or I should answer them?.
 ###answer 
 
You should answer all those things (excluding things that are a minhag — like V’zos HaTorah for example — and not obligatory). The reason is because there is no longer the concern that answering those devarim shbikdusha will cause an unnecessary Bracha, because you will say that second bracha regardless.
The same rule will apply in putting on Rabeinu Tam’s Teffilin and for those who follow the custom of wearing Teffilin on Chol Hamoed, albeit without a bracha.###question 
  How much dough should one separate for Hafroshas Challah?.
 ###answer 
 Since today the Challah is not given to the Cohen, any size portion is adequate. it is customary to separate at least a “kezayis“.
 ” ”  ”.###question 
  If a non-Jewish business made a mistake and sent us an additional item, do we need to return it?.
 ###answer 
 If there is a chance that the goy will realize and it will thus cause a Chilul Hashem then one must inform the goy (therefore when possible one should tell the goy that “I’m relying on your calculation”). Likewise,  if asked about this by the goy you cannot deny that you received the extra goods.
In absence of the above circumstances you may keep the additional item.
*The above is the “letter of the law”. It must however be mentioned that the Sefer Chasidim writes, (roughly:)
“Do not do treat the goyim unjustly as this will only pull you down and the debt will be repaid either by you or your descendants”.
The Poskim indeed bear witness, that people who gained from a goy’s mistake saw only misfortune from their choice, whereas many of those who made a Kiddush Hashem by returning costly items merited great wealth for themselves and future generations.###question 
  Is one allowed to do Nefilas Apayim while the Torah is out of the Aron, and if yes how should it be done?.
 ###answer 
 Regarding placing the head on the arm etc. – it is done as usual.
When the Sefer Torah is being moved and requires one to stand, one should not be sitting, but may continue reciting the Nefilas Apayim prayer normally. Nonetheless, according to Kabalah, Nefilas Apayim should always be done sitting. Therefore, it is best to wait and recite it once the Sefer Torah is in a stationary position.

 No. But you must wash (by a sink etc.) with a Bracha after you get up and are ready to make the Bracha, as usual.###question 
  Can I fold laundry on Shabbos?.
 ###answer 
 Folding garments improve the garment, and therefore it is forbidden to fold clothes on Shabbos.
One may fold old garments, not on the original fold line. Some are stringent with this too.
If the folding prepares the garment for weekday use it also shouldn’t be done on Shabbos. However, if the folding is done as part of organizing the home, i.e. there is no room for the garments and they are taking up space, and for whatever reason one couldn’t do this before Shabbos, one may fold them on Shabbos, not on the original fold lines.###question 
  Can a girl work in the younger division of a boys camp?
I work as an assistant director of a BOYS day camp.
We have campers age 6-12 and counselors aged 13-20.
We have a “kiddies” bunk in camp, with an older married woman as the main “morah”, there is the option to have a 18 year old girl as the helper for that bunk.
They would be in a totally separate classroom, doing their own activities. They would only eat in the lunchroom at the same time (separate table of course) share the bus during trips (sitting separately in the back or front), and some few activities.
Is there an issue having an unmarried girl in camp?.
 ###answer 
 
Absolutely unacceptable. Even with married staff, there are concerns, certainly with teenagers. It is obvious that single boys and girls working together will undoubtedly lead to a sub-conscious laxity in tznius, and can extend even outside the workspace as they get more comfortable with each other, or in general, they can become comfortable with the opposite gender – a breach of the wall of tznius that exists in our society where boys/girls are kept separate. Often the staff will need to be in contact regarding different matters (transportation, trips, deliveries, etc.) that will require direct communication via cell phone, with its consequences.
I would rather not elaborate on such a topic, but many issues have arisen from such camps, with many having long-term effects. (I want to add that putting boys/girls in this situation with these challenges is a severe violation of Lifnei Iver, and very unfair to them, especially if they are/were unaware. Some counselors will be too embarrassed to speak up about it although the situation is difficult for them or they know it’s wrong).
This is even if what you describe is true and your intentions are pure, nevertheless, we daven every day   . .   and are warned      . However, practically we know what actually happens, ”. And If we are dealing with a mossad of chinuch which endeavors to instill in the children proper chassidish values, the responsibility is greater.
This touches on multiple prohibitions which are practically impossible to prevent, including but not limited to:
Needless chatter (inevitable) – other than a polite hello when needed:
Talking to women and one’s wife
It’s known that a man should not say hello to a woman. What if she said hello to me, what do I do? And is a man allowed to say hello to his niece and sister in-law?
Referring by the first name:
I am a Seminary student and I work in an office in the afternoon. Can the males in the office call me by my first name or should they call me with the title Miss? I have to communicate information and be driven by a man.
Boys looking at girls (inevitable):
Are men allowed to look at women? (Not talking about family of course) and in what setting are men allowed to look at women? 
Proper dress – in a camp setting, people might come to be dressed in a way which is forbidden for someone of the opposite gender to see (this is a problem regardless but obviously doubled when an opposite gender is there).
Activities – some activities involve body movement which are forbidden to be viewed by boys/men – see here:
There is an exercise class with only female participants, however the instructor is male. Is it okay to join the class?
Singing – see here:
Can a group of girls (11-14 years old) sing together in a nursing home?

A Guide for a Yiddishe Summer Experience –    ”   ”###question 
  Is cotton Tzitzis kosher according to Halacha and could you make a Bracha on it?.
 ###answer 
 
When one wears a woolen four-cornered garment, he is certainly fulfilling a Mitzvah Min Hatorah. However, when one wears a cotton four-cornered garment, there is a dispute as to whether he is fulfilling a Mitzvah Min Hatorah or Miderabanan. That is why it is generally preferred to wear woolen four-cornered garments, and this is Minhag Chabad.
Another dispute concerning a cotton four-cornered garment is whether one may attach to them Tzitzis strings made out of wool, or whether the strings must be made of cotton. The Alter Rebbe confirms that the custom is like the lenient opinion, but adds that every G-d fearing person should nevertheless be stringent and use only cotton Tzitzis strings on a cotton four-cornered garment. It must be noted that cotton Tzitzis strings are not commercially manufactured at present, which means that all cotton four-cornered garments available for purchase use woolen Tzitzis strings, and are thus not the ideal way of performing this Mitzvah.
In such a case of wool tzitzis on the cotton garment, a Bracha should ideally not be made on the tallis katan. However, there is room to justify the practice of those who make a bracha on it. (The Alter Rebbe says only “nachon hadavar”, not an issur. He doesn’t use the regular lashon of safek brachos lhakel, as we don’t hold that way, and it’s only a chumra. Furthermore, b’pashtus it’s only talking about when he has another proper tallis shel tzemer. In any event, the Alter Rebbe says that the minhag clearly is to put tzemar tzitzis in meshi. And in the place of a minhag, we don’t say safek brachos lhakel).
For both of these reasons, the Alter Rebbe states that one who wishes to keep this Mitzvah in the best way should ensure that both the four-cornered garment as well as the Tzitzis strings are made of wool.###question 
  Should a Grandson Say Kaddish for his Grandparent?
If someone’s grandparent passes away and there are no sons or sons-in-law to say Kaddish and the family asks the grandson so say Kaddish, May the grandson do so? Is there a chiyuv to do so? Should they be chazzan?.

Yes, the grandson may say Kaddish for the grandparent. If he has a parent that is alive, he should get their permission.
Yes, there is a Chiyuv for the grandchild to say Kaddish after the grandparent. (Although not as much as a son for their parent).

  After Melava Malka, does one recite “Al Naharos Bavel” or “Shir Hama’alos” in Bentching?.
 ###answer 
 Our custom is to recite Shir Hamaalos and Livnei Korach any day/time upon which Tachanun is not said.
Therefore, on a regular Motsaei Shabbos these should be recited only if the Birkas Hamazon is being said before Chatzos, as Tachanun is not recited up until that time.

  Is it permitted to use Ma’aser money for a teacher training course?.
 ###answer 
 Maaser is intended to benefit the poor. Nonetheless, it is customary to use Maaser money for other non obligatory mitzvos. If this is an obligatory training course, Maaser may not be used. Even if it is optional, it would not be proper to use it to pay for a local teacher training course. However, you may certainly deduct the cost of this teaching course as a “business expense” from your revenue, and you will not need to give Maaser on this amount.
[There are general leniencies in the Halachos of Maaser for one who is struggling to meet basic living expenses, but that is a separate question.]
This is not a endorsement for any course or organization.###question

Although it would be best to avoid and at least turn away from it so it’s not in your view, strictly speaking, there is no problem to continue davening or learning when passing a church.###question 
  Is there a known reason why it is not customarily for Chabad Chassidim to take Shabbos in early?.
 ###answer 
 In Shulchan Oruch, bringing in Shabbos early is regarded as a noble practice. Nevertheless, in 770, Shabbos was never brought in early, and it is common practice in Chabad not to bring Shabbos in early. [It is told that Tzach once suggested that the Pegishos bring in Shabbos early to make it easier for the students who were tired and not accustomed to a late Friday night schedule. However, the Rebbe responded something to the effect that to bring in Shabbos early is not Minhag Chabad.]
Possible suggested reasons for this practice:
1. The Alter Rebbe writes (in his Teshuvos) that it has become customary to be stringent and not daven Maariv before Tzeis, and the Tzemach Tzedek writes that someone who is particular about this should do so even at the expense of davening with a Minyan before Tzeis. Even so, it is not completely clear whether their words apply to Friday night or just other nights of the week. See also here:
      ,                ?
2. Bringing in Shabbos early requires one to adhere to the relevant associated Dinim, such as davening Mincha before Plag and Maariv after Plag, repeating Shema after Tzeis Hakochavim, reciting Kiddush and beginning the meal more than half hour before Tzeis Hakochavim. Included in this is ensuring that one has the right times for Plag and Tzeis, as there are different ways of calculating it. According to some Achronim, the husband’s Kabbolas Shabbos will influence when the wife has to Bentch Licht, but it does not clear that the Alter Rebbe would hold this way, and there are also a number of other reasons to be lenient.
3. When a Kehillah brings in Shabbos early, this can enforce Kabbolas Shabbos on individuals as well, subject to a number of conditions, which may inconvenience their Shabbos preparations or impede their chance to daven Mincha. This will also be detrimental for those people who are not yet Frum. [See ” ’ ”  ” about having concern for others]
4. Not bringing in Shabbos early allows one time to learn Chassidus after Shabbos comes in, as a preparation for Kabbolas Shabbos and Maariv. [  ’ ” ” ”]
5. Some Achronim explain that the Maalah of bringing in Shabbos early is primarily when it is done for Hiddur Mitzvah and Kovod Shabbos, and not out of convenience. For example, if it is done year round instead of just in the summer. [  ” ” ’ ”,   ” ’ ”]
6. Some argue that according to Kaballah one shouldn’t daven Maariv so early. [״ ׳  ״]

    ###question 
 My parents are not frum and help us cook and with the kids. Is there a hakpada in halacha to make them wash Negel Vasser before they serve us any food and feed my children, etc.? Especially based on today’s daily halacha that this creates a ruach ra and causes timtum halev, chas veshalom….
 ###answer 
 
You should definitely try to have them wash Negel Vasser before touching food. Of course, this should be done in a pleasant manner without creating tension and friction.
If not possible to have them do so, or B’dieved, post facto, see here:
If cloths or food have been touched without doing Negel Vasser first, can they still be used?
As for feeding children such food, especially babies, if there is no other food, even those who are stringent would agree that one may be lenient. However, it’s recommended if at all possible to arrange other food for the baby, if it’s not at the expense of the baby’s welfare and doesn’t create unnecessary friction.###question 
  Can I bake fish in an oven that has meat residue and grease on its walls?.

 Do the halachas of a bathroom, such as using the water for Negel Vassar, or drinking the water etc. apply to a new, fully renovated bathroom that has not been used?.
 ###answer 
 
Yes, the halachos regarding a bathroom apply. The exception is that only inside is considered a bathroom before using it, but the walls on the outside are not.
Nonetheless, the examples you mentioned are fine, such as drinking the water or using the water tor Negel Vasser.###question 
  Can the husband be in the delivery room, especially if there is no doula present?
I am a doctor. I have seen from personal experience that people get better care if they are not alone in the hospital. Especially sometimes if the woman is alone during birth, she may be pressured to do a procedure to save a doctor or other provider time which is not necessary and can lead to negative health outcomes for herself or the newborn baby..
 ###answer 
 
According to halacha, there are serious concerns with the husband being present in the delivery room. Even where a potential heter can be found, the Rebbe spoke strongly against this practice and stated that it is considered a breach of modesty. The Rebbe commented that at the time of birth one should seek out extra z’chusim and certainly not add in matters which are the opposite of z’chus.
That being said, if there is a concern of danger or if the woman is actually scared (and not just because she wants it or because others are doing it…)  and there is no one else to assist, you may help and do as she needs. You should preferably wear gloves to minimize contact and face the other direction.###question 
  Do filter bags need to have a Hechsher since they are going into soups?.
 ###answer 
 The filter bags don’t need to be kosher but you must be sure that no bugs can leave the bag.
As for the idea of using such bags to prevent the need for checking: With foods that are certainly infested, one should not do this, but we need not admonish those who do, provided the garment is thick.
Where the food is not definitely infested, it may be done but one should check and clean first superficially.
Explanation in brief:
The bugs that are in the unchecked herbs would give off a bad taste to the soup and would be inconsequential (any non-kosher food that gives a bad taste to a kosher food is called Pagum and doesn’t make the kosher food non-kosher).
Even though one may not intentionally nullify something that is forbidden, here your intention is not to nullify the bugs but rather to add the taste of herbs to the soup.
Even if there is a remote concern that the bugs might have left the bag, we may assume that the bugs stayed in the bag, and even if they left the bag there is an assumption that the bugs became crushed during the cooking process and therefore could be nullified in the soup.###question

Q. If not, would it make a difference if it was intentional or not, for example sometimes one can play with dry skin on his face, and it will unintentionally (eventually) fall off, is that problematic?
A. One should be cautious not to scratch or play around with dry skin as it will cause it to fall off.
 ”   ”  ”.
Q. Similarly, is there a problem squeezing zits and pimples, etc. on Shabbos? Does one’s intention make a difference? And would it make a difference one is applying pressure to the zits etc. or if he is just touching it with his fingers?
A. Anything that might cause it to pop or bleed poses an issue.

P.S. the above-mentioned applies to normal circumstances, if however there is pain involved different rules apply.
Q. Why are there no Geziros against the habit of picking one’s skin or lips, due to the problems it creates for Shabbos?
A. In general, it is hard to question the decision of the Chachomim when they have decided to institute a Gezeira and when not.
However, Poskim and Rabbonim throughout the ages have encouraged to break the habit of picking one’s skin, lips or hair and biting nails, as it can lead to several Issurim, namely transgressing a possible Issur from the Torah if one would continue doing so on Shabbos.

A. One is permitted to peel a scab with ones hand even when the wound healed and one has no pain from it. However, if it will cause bleeding one may not do so.
” ״ , . ” , .    ,  ” .###question 
  I had a couple of disturbing dreams that I was doing something against halacha. is it something I should ignore or is there something I should do about it?.
 ###answer 
 In general we are not particular about dreams nowadays, because we don’t really know how to interpret them properly; only a Rebbe can tell us their meaning.
Sometimes the yetzer hara tries to make us feel lowly by making us have such dreams, and we must ignore them and continue serving Hashem with joy. The Rebbe suggested to people that were disturbed by dreams try to find a positive interpretation for it,  be careful about saying Krias Shema at night, check the mezuza of the room they sleep in, and give tzedaka every erev shabbos and yom tov (men should also check their tefillin, give tzedaka every day as well as mikva).
However since dreams may be due to things we think about during the day, we must find ways to stop ourselves from having such thoughts (even thinking about a past dream). I suggest you discuss this with your mashpia (especially if you may be struggling with some of the things you dreamed about).

 Does he need to say hagomal? Anything?.
 ###answer 
 
One who needlessly places themselves in a dangerous situation does not bentch hagomel. He may say it without Hashem’s name if he wishes.
Other ways to thank Hashem:
To have this in mind when saying the bracha of hagomel chasadim tovim in the morning Brachos, when saying modim in shmone esrei, and saying borchu in shul (preferably by buying and receiving an aliya).###question 
  May one put salt in water on Shabbos?.
 ###answer 
 Putting salt in cold water (or other liquids) on Shabbos:
For pickling purposes – it is forbidden, even if one will immediately eat some of the foods being pickled.
To serve as a dip or dressing – it is permitted, provided that all the following conditions are met.
One is making a small amount for only one meal;
It is being made immediately before such a meal;
The mixture will have a ratio of less than two-thirds of salt.
Regarding preparing saltwater for  when Pesach falls out on Shabbos, it should be done before Shabbos. If one forgot to make before Shabbos, he may make a very small amount on Shabbos with the above conditions.###question

 ###answer 
 This is something that the Poskim discuss regarding young men as well, that struggle with this issue.
Ultimately, the mitzva is to satisfy the wife. One should try to do as much as they can to satisfy her. This is not something which should chas vsholom cause a breakdown in the marriage. Rather, one should find other ways to make his wife feel special, especially if she expresses the need. There are also medications and treatments that help, and a husband is obligated to make use of them wherever possible. However, when the husband is elderly, at an age where most people in this age bracket have the same issue, he isn’t obligated to go for treatment. Regardless, the mitzvah should not be withheld.

״ ״ , .###question 
 I am a woman and recently learned that there is a practice to spit at a certain part in Alienu. I grew up in another sect of Yiddishkeit where we just skipped that section so as to avoid benefiting from the spit produced to say those words. Now that I have learned that Chabad Chassidim actually do spit, I am kind of grossed out— I have never noticed women spitting before and it’s hard to imagine myself beginning this practice. I have been skipping Alienu besides saying the Al Tira section because I don’t know what to do. Should I spit too or is there a different Halacha for women since it is not so feminine to spit?.
 ###answer 
 
I’m aware that there are many versions of the siddur that omit those words. As far as I know, it’s not because of the reasons you mentioned. The reason you mentioned is brought as one of many explanations of why there is such a custom to spit during those words. This isn’t just a Chabad custom; it has much earlier sources.
You can always choose to spit into a tissue, in a modest secretive way.
Generally, women aren’t obligated to say Aleinu. But it is a good idea to say it. You should not refrain from saying it just because of the above issue.###question 
 Do I need to wait for someone else to open the door or can I initially stand by the door, be seen through the camera and get buzzed in?.
 ###answer 
 
You should wait and walk in with someone else who is already opening the door for themselves.
Explanation: 
There are some Poskim that are more lenient when it comes to a Yid being buzzed in on Shabbos by a non-Jew, since the goy can open it via other ways, such as opening the handle, but chooses the easier path, using electronic buzzer.
However, not all buzzing devices are the same, and moreover, your case entails other Halachic dilemmas too, such as an the identifying camera, etc. and therefore, you should wait and join someone else that walks in, even if it takes a while.###question 
  If the dry cleaners is a goyisha place, can I drop off dry cleaning during the week of Tisha B’Av and pick it up Friday for Shabbos?.
 ###answer 
 One may not give clothes to a non-Jew during the nine days for them to clean even if it would be worn after Tisha B’av and even if they were told to only clean it after Tisha B’av.
In a situation where you don’t have a clean shirt for Shabbos, it would be permitted.###question

  Is it necessary to loosen the “yud” of the Tefillin kesher and re-tighten it every time when putting on Tefillin?

 ###answer 
 
There are different customs between Chabad Chassidim on this matter. You may continue with your current practice. It appears that the Rebbe did not do it.
Either way, one who does do it should do it before the Bracha to avoid a question of a hefsek.###question

  What are the laws behind hunting? Does it make a difference if the hunting (let’s say for deer) is for population control purposes?.
 ###answer 
 Hunting deer is not allowed.
Reasoning:
As a general rule mere sport hunting is not allowed. Since deer are not a danger to humans as a general rule, it would be difficult to argue that hunting would be permitted to regulate population control.
See the Noda Be’Yehuda (Tanina Yoreh Deah 10) that prohibits hunting for various reasons, of them: 1) it is dangerous, 2) it is causing needless pain to animals, and 3) it is wasting, Bal Tashchis.
Even if not all three reasons for sure apply, at least one of the reasons should apply in any given hunting case.###question 
  What is the reason that Chabad doesn’t say Barchu after Aleinu in Ma’ariv if he missed it in the beginning?.
 ###answer 
 Perhaps this is due to the opinion that Barchu cannot be recited without a Baracha afterwards.

 ###answer 
 
There is no need to re-learn that which was learned after dawn. However once dawn arrives one may not continue learning without reciting Birchas Hatorah.
Regarding the Zmanim: The reason for the discrepancy in the Zmanim is based on a disagreement how to calculate this zman. See here for an analysis of this matter

  What should I do about Toiveling a dish if I can’t get the sticker completely off? Is it a Chatzitzah?
I have something I need to toivel but the label sticker won’t come off all the way. is it still a chatzitzah or can it be toiveled any way?.
 ###answer 
 
Ideally, one should remove all the stickers or labels from the dishes before the tevila.
However, in a case where the stickers are covering only the minority of the dish and it is in such a manner that most people don’t mind its presence, one may toivel the dishes with the stickers on, if removing them would be a big hassle. If on occasion one minds its presence it’s considered a chatzitzah (intervening substance), and must be removed.
For example, if the sticker is underneath the utensil, we could assume that people aren’t concerned with using the dish while the sticker is underneath.
Labels which contain instructions for usage need not be removed.
Stickers which make the utensil look more expensive, such as a brand name, or if it is there for beauty, need not be removed.
Once one started removing the sticker, it should be removed completely, as people often mind when there is an incomplete sticker or leftovers from a sticker. The glue which remains after the removal of the stickers is not an issue if it has no substance, i.e. it is not felt when touching it. If it does have substance, it must be removed if people mind its presence.###question 
  I found a Machzor in a prison chapel library, there are no Jews there. Should I take it?
I found a Machzor for Yom Kippur in the prison chapel library, amongst goyish books. Since some inmates take the books and desecrate them and since, as far as I know, there are no Jews there (I do not know for sure) can I keep and use the book even though it has a stamp inside saying that it is prison property?.
 ###answer 
 
You should speak to the librarian and ask him if you could keep it. If he doesn’t let, and you’re concerned that it might be desecrated, it’s a mitzvah to buy the sefer so that it shouldn’t come to disgrace.
If no such concern exist, then it is worthwhile to leave it there so it could be used in the future by Jewish inmates who might be sent there.

  Medical professionals recommend taking activated charcoal pills for certain stomach conditions . Do these pills require a proper hashgacha?.
 ###answer 
 Charcoal in itself, is not an issue if it’s vegetarian. The same holds true for the capsule.
When vegetarian is not available:
If a physician / medical professional has advised taking Activated Charcoal due to pain that may sometimes be severe, tasteless – unflavored – pills may be taken.
You may look into getting from Israel with Badatz of Eida Hechsher, or perhaps from Boro Park at KosherVitamins.com.
Explanation:
Non Vegetarian Activated Charcoal Pill can also be made from non-Kosher ingredients, as Bone Char etc. The same applies with the capsule, as it could be made with Gelatin etc.
However, since it’s burned out, not edible and tasteless, we may be lenient in a case of a Chole She-ayn Bo Sakono, which includes strong pain that can be alleviated by taking this pill.
The reason we have not suggested taking the powder out of the capsule is because this particular medicine will thereby lose the effectiveness, and additionally, the capsule is tasteless. (It should be noted that the tablets without the capsules might have a taste, and therefore it is best to use those with the capsule).
All the above applies for a patient with pain experiencing difficulty obtaining Activated Charcoal Pills that are vegetarian or ones with a Hechsher.

  What should I do If a mouse gets trapped in a glue traps over Shabbos?
I have mice in my apartment and I have glue traps out. If a mouse gets trapped in one of the glue traps over Shabbos what should I do? Let the mouse sit in the glue trap over Shabbos? Or can I throw away the mouse and the glue trap?.
 ###answer 
 
If it’s in a corner and not bothering anyone, best to leave it until after Shabbos. If it’s noticeable and making people feel uncomfortable, you can discard it on Shabbos (best with a Shinui, like with the back of your hand etc).###question 
 In the current situation where so many peulos of shlichus happen over zoom and over the phone. For example I give a Tanya Shiur over the phone every morning. Is there an inyan to blow shofar -now in Chodesh Elul- to be mezake Yidden that definitely won’t hear it otherwise? Since there’s no yetziyas yedey chov over here. It’s only a minhag to be meorer people, perhaps it’s a proper thing to do as part of my call? And kemuvan I can make a disclaimer before and after that it’s not the real thing...
 ###answer 
 
In the Sicha of Balak 5744, the Rebbe mentions that even the blowing of the Shofar of Elul should not be listened through electronic devices etc.
The reason for that – explains the Rebbe – is that the sounding of Shofar in Elul is [amongst other reasons] done in order to encourage the Yidden to do Teshuva etc.
Now, it appears that in a case where one wouldn’t hear the Shofar otherwise, it would not be an issue to do it over the phone or video call etc.
In such a case, it is indeed proper to make a disclaimer and explain that 1. this is not the appropriate method for shofar and whenever possible a person should try to hear it in person, and 2. that on Rosh Hashanah, of course, one must only hear the Shofar in person etc.

  Can I leave Alexa on over Shabbos?
It doesn’t do anything on Shabbos, as I would not be saying her name. (It only “wakes up” when you say the wake-up word, namely “alexa”. Otherwise it doesn’t do anything).

  Playing Monopoly: Are you allowed to charge interest (Ribbis) on a loan in a game?.

  We have 12 Kohanim and 2 Yisroelim. How should we go about the Aliyos of the Tochacha (Ki Savo)?
We have 12 Kohanim and 2 Yisroelim, 1 of the Yisroelim will be Laining and is a chiyuv (in the 12 months from the petira of his son). This minyan is happening Shabbos ki Savo, where the baal korei normally receives the aliya of shishi.

 Is this a minhag or has some basis?.
 ###answer 
 
There is a custom recorded in Shulchan Aruch to draw water from a well or natural spring on Motzei Shabbos, because the Well of Miriam is found in them at that time, and drinking from the Well of Miriam cures a person from his/her diseases (see Sicha of the Rebbe quoted below).
Based on this many have a custom to “draw” new water (at least from the sink) on Motzei Shabbos.

I am in quarantine as I was exposed to Covid-19 in my class. I live in Crown Heights and I did not know what to do for Tashlich because I cannot leave my house until Sunday (Erev Yom Kippur). What is the best way I can do Tashlich?.
 ###answer 
 
You should do tashlich on the day before Erev Yom Kippur (this year [5781], since it is on Shabbos, do it on Thursday) with a bowl of water and again on Sunday, Erev Yom Kippur (when you can leave your house) by a river with fish.###question 
  Can I make a Sukkah with walls that are just 10 Tefachim tall and the Schach will be a few feet higher?
If I have walls of a Sukkah that are just above 10 Tefachim- (there’s a big gap from them until the Scach) – how much of a gap is allowed to be from the top of the wall to the scach on top of the walls?.
 ###answer 
 
If the walls are at least 10 Tefachim high, there can be an unlimited space between the top of the walls and the Schach, provided that:
The walls are lined directly under the Schach or at least within 3 Tefachim of it; and
This Schach right above the walls is a Kosher Schach.
Additionally, the walls cannot be erected 3 Tefachim or more from the ground, and, of course, the height of the Sukkah cannot exceed 20 Amos.###question

  Am I allowed to use the sunroof of a car with Schach on it as a Sukkah when out on a family trip on Chol Hamoed Sukkos?
SimilarQuestion:
Can one make a sukkah by removing T tops and placing a mat on top, into a kosher albeit, temporary sukkah? Both sides of the roof would be off, but there is a .5 foot separation running down the middle..
 ###answer 
 
A few introductions:
A Sukkah has to:
be (and have walls that are) at least 32 inches tall and have width of at least 22.4 inches by 22.4 inches;
have at least 3 walls;
be a place where you are comfortable to eat, drink, spend time and sleep.
In this case:
A. the Schach would have to be covering a (uninterrupted) space that is 32″ tall and 22.4″ by 22.4″ (the seats would be considered an interruption);
B. the car (which is being used as walls) cannot be more than 9.48″ off the ground and the sides have to be directly under the Schach, and have above height;
C. you would have to be comfortable to eat sleep and spend time there.

See also the following excerpts from our Day to Day Halachic Guide:
MOBILE SUKKAH
A person who is traveling without access to a Sukkah, can create a Sukkah out of a vehicle (or two), as follows:
LOCATION
The spot you choose should be semi-secluded, and not on a public path where it would interfere with foot traffic. It should also be a safe, crime-free area, where you would technically be able to sleep at night. It should also fulfill the other requirements for the positioning of a Sukkah – the area above the s’chach free of tree limbs or overhangs
ASSEMBLY
Use the front and back door of a single vehicle (on the same side) or open a single door on mirroring sides of two vehicles. (The interior of a convertible or roadster that fits all the dimensions below can be used as well.)
The area created by the three sides (either the two doors and the one car body, or the two car bodies and the adjacent doors) has to be at least seven tefachim long and seven tefachim wide (about 22.5 inches on each side).
The doors must reach ten tefachim (3.25 feet) in height and start no more than three tefachim (9.5 inches) off the ground. Parking near a curb and opening the door(s) over the curb will help in this regard.
The doors must be fully and firmly open, so that a gust of wind will not slam them closed.
ROOF
It is preferable not to prop the s’chach directly on the car doors, but to first place wood laths or the like across and the s’chach on top of that. The s’chach should be fixed to the “roof” with jute twine or string (not zip ties) so that it will not blow away.
The above is set up in such a way that the “walls” of the Sukkah are adjacently perpendicular to the s’chach. If there is an area of four amos (six feet) of car roof on any side of the Sukkah or four tefachim (13 inches) of car roof or other unkosher covering in the middle of the Sukkah, it is unusable.115 If the mobile Sukkah is of the smallest possible size (seven by seven tefachim), any three-tefach span of car roof – whether in the middle or on the side – will invalidate it.
USE
You must hold your food or put it down on a table or surface inside your makeshift Sukkah. You may not eat under the s’chach and use the seat in the car (outside your Sukkah) as your table.
You must stipulate that the vehicle(s) will be able to be used for (non-holy) purposes after the Sukkah is dismantled, since, as stated above, we are usually not allowed to use the parts of a Sukkah for another purpose once they were used for a mitzvah.###question

 ###answer

  Can we take pictures of our 3-year-old daughter lighting Shabbos candles for the first time?
Can a photo be taken while we are lighting but before the Bracha is over? 
I was planning to light about a half hour early to make sure there is no risk of going into Shabbos..
 ###answer 
 
Strictly speaking, Halachically, there is no issue.
However, it is better for many reasons (and perhaps more practical) to take the pictures before she lights the actual Shabbos candles, i.e., you can set up different candles and have her light them and take pictures of that.
See more here and here.
A few points to note:
1. One may only light Shabbos candles after the Zman of Plag Hamincha.
2. Once a woman lights the Shabbos candles (after the above mentioned time), she automatically accepts Shabbos (together with all its laws) upon herself.
3. Our Minhag is that a girl begins lighting Shabbos (and Yom Tov) candles even before she turns 3; as soon as she’s able to say the Brocho(s).
4. The Rebbe suggested that a girl should start lighting candles for the first time on a Yom Tov, so that the Bracha of Shehecheyanu can be valid for (the Yom Tov itself and for) the lighting of the candles as well. Alternatively, when lighting for the first time on a Shabbos, the girl should wear a new garment and recite Shehecheyanu for the same purpose (i.e., so that the Bracha can ‘go’ on the lighting in addition to the new garment).###question 
  When must one fast when the Retzuah of his Tefillin flips over?
What is the meaning of the Middas Chassidus (” ” ’  ” ”) to fast if the retzuos flip over? Does it mean even if it was just flipped over momentarily (like right when it was put on) and he right away corrected it or is it only if he only realized after he took them off and he wasn’t able to put them back on properly, meaning that on that day he only wore tefillin with overturned retzuos? (If it means even if it only flipped momentarily, then why is it such a big deal, any different than the tefillin falling out of place for a second?).
 ###answer 
 
Either when putting it on and it was not turned over properly before one spoke or made a hefsek, or it got turned over at a later point even momentarily.
This only applies to the part of the strap which surrounds the head, and the hand strap only to the first circuit surrounding the arm.
Some say it is only an issue if the strap was lying that way all day long or at least it was this way until after the time of reciting the Shema.
As for the reasons why specifically in the case that the retzuos flipped over there is a midas chassidus to fast (or redeem the fast with tzedakah) please see the 2nd line of the sources.###question

  Does a blanket with 4 corners need Tzitzis if it is worn?
 If yes,can you cut a corner (to make it round)? What is considered rounded?.
 ###answer 
 
The common custom is not to attach Tzitzis to blankets, whether they are made of wool or of linen. [The rationale is that] some authorities maintain that the Torah requires [that Tzitzis be attached] only to an article with which one covers himself as a garment. The words ”which you cover yourself” clearly imply “clothe yourself.” Articles that one merely spreads over oneself, like sheets or blankets, are not called garments at all.
However, since some authorities dissent with this interpretation, one should round off one corner of the blanket, so that according to all authorities they will be exempt from Tzitzis.
(A number of proposals have them put forth to explain why people are not particular about this, see below in the references in Hebrew.)
” ’  ’          – ”  ,  .
Regarding rounding a corner: Some Poskim say it’s enough it it looks round. Other Poskim say one must make the entire corner of 3×3 etzbaos (6-6.5cm / 2.4-2.6 in) round. Anything less than this requires Tzitzis.
See picture here:

  Is there any benefit to putting up a Mezuzah on a different door of the house, other than the front door?
We met a not-yet-frum couple recently, and we are to gift them a Mezuzah and help put it up for them. However, it’s very likely they wouldn’t want it on their front door. Is there any benefit to putting it up on a different door of their house? If so, which is the best doorway?.
 ###answer 
 
It definitely is a good idea to help them affix a Mezuzah to their home. If they won’t agree to put it on the front door, then they should put it by any room that is halachically obligated in Mezuza according to ALL opinions. This would probably be the bedroom that has a proper door to it.
On the contrary, often the front door is less obligated than other doors, as the foyer is less than 4×4 Amos.###question 
  When is the accurate Zman for Motzei Shabbos according to the Alter Rebbe?.
 ###answer

  Does A Sirtuk Need Tzitzis?
If a Sirtuk with four corners has one of its corners folded and sewed so that it appears rounded, is it acceptable?
Also, can I try-on a non-rounded Sirtuk in the store?.
 ###answer 
 
As you correctly indicated, a Sirtuk—as is the case with any four-cornered garment—cannot be worn (unless Tzitzits are added).
Folding the corner as you mentioned, however, is not acceptable since the Sirtuk still retains all its corners (only that one is folded). The common practice is, therefore, to cut off one of the corners in such a way that it is rounded enough to be exempt from Tzitzis. 
[See here for the minimum rounding required.]###question 
  A friend asked if I can pick up something for her while shopping for groceries, I told her it was $9.49 and she sent me $9.50 via Cash App. Is that considered Ribbis?.
 ###answer 
 In general one may add a couple of pennies, provided both of the following conditions are met:
1. It is an insignificant amount, that neither the borrower nor the lender would search for the amount of money if they had dropped it on the floor.
2. He is only doing so because it is easier (e.g. someone who owes 99 cents and gives a dollar instead of getting change to pay 99 cents).
In your specific case with cash app, it is not easier to give 9.50 instead of 9.49 and therefore it would be a problem.
After it was received, in your specific case it does not have to be returned.
P.S. In the future you should not accept the cash app payment and right away return it.###question 
  Are people allowed to deny a Kohen his Aliyah?
I have seen the seder of aliyos “Kohen-Levi-Yisroel” being disregarded way too many times, especially on Shabbos before Yud Shvat and Simchas Torah, when everyone wants an aliyah. There is no question that if there are no Kohanim or Leviim present there should be no issues, but otherwise, are people allowed to deny a Kohen his aliyah? As a Kohen, I felt bothered by it many times. Why should the Halachah of the Shulchan Aruch and a mitzvah of the Torah be disregarded for a minhag? As a Kohen, should I stand up for myself or let it go?
If there is a halacha issue to deny the Kohen his aliyah, perhaps there should be a public reminder of this issue?.
 ###answer 
 
As a Kohen, you have no obligation to stand up for your aliya as it is the mitzvah of the congregation to honor the Kohen and not your mitzvah. On the contrary, you should give your permission so that those that need an aliya can receive one.
As a general rule, the first aliya should be given to a Kohen if there is one in shul and it should not be disregarded as it is a Mitzvas Asei.
At certain set times, this was not kept for the benefit of the community such as making money for the shul and the like. But this should be done only if there is such a set Minhag in place.
Also, when there is a great need, there is room to be lenient and call up a Yisroel in the place of a Kohen, but only with the full permission of the Kohen and without disregarding that he is a Kohen (i.e. they should not say “Ein Kan Kohen” – there is no Kohen here when he is actually in the room). This is especially true by mincha shabbos afternoon and by the kriah of Monday and Thursday, where there is more room for leniency.
In practice, in a regular Shul one should not call up a Levi or Yisroel in the place of a Kohen (when there is a Kohen present) unless there is a great financial loss for the shul and/or many chiyuvim, and even so not on a regular basis, the Kohen should give his full permission and leave the Shul,
In a Shul like 770, this should still be maintained, but the Kohen would not have to leave the Shul.###question

  Is one allowed to feed a fish on Shabbos?.
 ###answer 
 One may make give them food, even if they are not the owner of the fish, provided they are owned by Jews. This applies to all animals which are dependent on people for their food (like pets), except for pigs. However, there are those who write that animals, particularly fish, which are fed once a day should preferably be fed right before Shabbos. Of course, if one forgot it would be permissible to feed them even on Shabbos.
One may not feed animals which get their food on their own (except for a non barking dog, even if it’s a stray ownerless dog) unless they can’t find food. In the case where someone is getting rid of their own food, they may as well give it to the animal. Some however are particular to give a animal owned by a non Jew.###question 
 Our business is registration of charities in Canada. Many of our clients’ churches are Avodah Zara (Hindus, Buddhists). Is there an issue with taking them on as clients? (sechar, hana’ah from avoda zara, abizraihu, lifnei iver, etc.)
Note that we are not the only firm in the country that does this work; there are other firms that could assist them (negating lifnei iver).
Note that the only benefit of becoming a charity in Canada is that the registrant could issue tax receipts to donors (to reduce their taxes) – but they could operate as a church without the charity status. I would also note that they pay us prior to the registration (they pay upfront), though we provide a guarantee of registration. Would that make a difference?.

 Is it more preferable to prepare Chanukah candles by oneself then buying ready made ones, and if it is: what if the ready made ones burn nicer?.
 ###answer 
 
There is no halachic requirement to prepare the wicks yourself, though some are particular to do so for various reasons (see references in Hebrew below). Clearly, if the ready-made ones burn better they are halachically preferable.
Note however that often the ready-made ones might have other deficiencies in terms of various Hiddurim (though some of these hiddurim are questionable as there are many who maintain that there is really no significant benefit in doing so). For example, there are those who are particular to use only extra virgin olive oil (and some opine that it must be edible oil as well). Other hiddurim are: using oil that is liquid not gelled, using wicks that are not coated, using old wicks, amongst others.
Besides the above-mentioned it’s preferable that there is a hechsher confirming that everything is genuine and kosher.###question 
 When eating something that has a few ingredients, mostly one Bracha and less of another, but if you count each ingredient separately the lesser one will have more, which Bracha is tafel to which?
For example: Salad with cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers, and lots of avocados but if you include all of the other vegetables together they will be more, is the Bracha Hoadama or Haeitz?.
 ###answer 
 
When eating a salad with different ingredients one makes a Bracha on the main ingredient and that includes other ingredients.
In a case where both ingredients are equal we’ll make the Bracha on the ingredient which is the majority in the mixture. However, if neither ingredient is the majority such as a mixture of cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers, and lots of avocados, each one is considered an  for itself and two Brachos are required.
Additionally, majority in this case refers to an item which is the majority of the entire mixture combined, and it not sufficient if it’s more than other ingredients. In both these cases it’s advisable to make ץ and  on other vegetables first.###question

Unlike any other Hanhoga Tova, this is an absolute obligation according to Shulchan Aruch. Thus, there is no such thing as Hatoro. I suggest you find some time to do it perhaps on Shabbos.###question 
  I have sea salt from the pacific ocean. Can I use it to Kosher meat?.
 ###answer 
 If the salt is fully dried, then yes, provided that the grains of salt are not all very fine (like table salt) nor very big (too big to adhere well to the meat). Generally sea salt is the preferred size (even though there are finer grains mixed in with the larger ones).
Sea salt is actually the preferred koshering salt of most kashrus agencies.

  Would it be better to give out things on Mivtzoyim without a Rebbe picture, so that it shouldn’t be thrown out?.
 ###answer 
 You should continue giving out the picture of the Rebbe.
The same issue and even more serious is about the Torah literature that you distribute. You should still give it out.###question 
  Is it permitted to play a “one time” dreidel game using real money where players can make or lose money. Is there a problem of gambling?.
 ###answer 
 The following options are acceptable, in order of priority:
Best would be if all the money is returned to the parties after the game. If for whatever reason you believe this wouldn’t work, then try one of the other options below.
All the money goes to Tzedaka.
In the beginning before playing all the money is deposited in a box which belongs to all parties. The individuals agree in advance to be makneh the money to whomever wins. This solution isn’t ideal, but could work where for whatever reason it’s necessary to do so.###question 
  Is playing with something on Shabbos (ex. bending a straw back and forth) because I’m bored considered Muktza?.
 ###answer 
 Yes it is Muktza. One may not move objects out of boredom, unless there is an actual need. There is a disagreement if it is permitted if you are doing it for slight enjoyment or out of nervousness (or the like).
Otherwise only food and books – that are allowed to be read – may be moved even without a substantial need.###question 
  Is it better to use nails or screws to affix Mezuzos, or is double sided sticky tape or glue just as “Mehudar”?.

 Strictly speaking, one may use glue or even double sided tape provided they are strong and durable. Nonetheless, nails are preferable, according to some.###question

 If I had a new suit tested and it was found to be Shaatnez-free, and then I purchased the same exact model suit from the same company, do I still need to check the new ones?.
 ###answer 
 
Yes, this new unchecked suit has to be also checked for Shaatnez. The one identical suit that was checked and been found without Shaatnez does not constitute a sufficient Chazaka to rely on in order to exempt checking the other identical unchecked suit.
Explanation:
There are over 20 places in a suit that are being checked for Shaatnez by the expert. Some spots are not universal even by well known manufacturers. Certainly, “one” suit is not sufficient. There are instances though – when Shaatnez Laboratory’s will rely on Chazaka, but that is only when checking numerous suits from the same maker and other details. (Even then, they might advise to be Mehader and check, since Shaatnez is a Lav Min HaTorah).###question 
  What should I do if I miss saying either one of the two Ashreis in Shachris?.
 ###answer 
 It can be said throughout the day. If it’s said after Mincha it should not be said as obligatory, rather as if one is reading Torah (Tehillim).###question 
  How much Tzedaka should a non Jew give? Do they also get rewarded?.
 ###answer 
 A Ben-Noach that does a Mitzvah which has a positive effect on himself or on the world around him, like giving Tzedakah, will indeed be rewarded.
However there are no specific Torah guidelines on how much Tzedakah a Ben-Noach should give.###question 
  Stronger right arm but writes with left arm. Which hand does he put on Teffilin?
This is a question about a boy I’m teaching for his Bar Mitzvah on Shlichus.
If ones right hand is his stronger hand and does all activities with his right arm, but writes with his left arm. What hand does he put on Teffilin?.
 ###answer 
 
He should put on his left hand. (If possible, he should be encouraged to also put on his right hand afterwards, Bli Neder).###question 
  Can we read Megilla with a microphone this year (5781), due to Covid?
Question Continued:
This year it is nearly impossible to get 100 people to be socially distanced hear Megillah. As Shluchim, we’d like to make a drive in event. Would reading the Megillah on a microphone help in this case in any way, shape or form?.
 ###answer 
 
No. A microphone may not be used for the Megillah reading, nor can the obligation of hearing the Megillah be fulfilled via telephone or live hook-up.
I would suggest you to contact other Chabad Shluchim to find alternatives (which are Halachically acceptable) to approach this present issue.

  Should Viyiten Lecha be recited while standing?.
 ###answer 
 Yes, there is a tradition to say say   while standing, and this is our Minhag. Indeed, the Rebbe usually did so in public (and as far as we know in private as well).###question 
 I’m curious how this works with larger flocks, must you just keep the harmed hen(s) in their own coop? Because how would you know which eggs belong to which hen? (Happens to be that our hen is the only one we have that lays brown eggs and our other hens lay a light brown shelled eggs so we can tell the difference, but if we had more hens we wouldn’t be able to).
I was wondering if you could shed any more light on the matter (as we hate tossing the eggs, and she has quite a few more years laying ahead of her).
Thank you..
 ###answer 
 
If it laid eggs at least 21 days after this incident happened, the eggs are kosher. Otherwise, all the eggs born from this hen would be problematic, and you would have to separate them.
However, if it happened that you have eggs which you don’t know which hen they came from (and it’s possible they were all born from the kosher one), you can eat them all.###question 
 Do I need to hand the Mishloach Manos package to the Shliach or can I ask the Shliach to pick up something from the store for me and the like?.
 ###answer 
 The Shliach can pick it up from the store.
When does the Shliach need to be appointed as such: can it be done before Purim? 
Yes, but he must deliver the Mishloach Manos on Purim day.
    ”  ”.
Can the Shliach prepare the Mishloach Manos before Purim and just do the delivery on Purim?
Yes, as above.
Note: The above is only regarding fulfilling the actual Mitzvah of Mishloach Manos. However, if you are giving Mishloach Manos to (at least) one person in a regular way, all the restrictions above do not apply while giving to others.###question

 Our son’s birthday is in Elul. He wants to wait until tishrei to have a celebration with his classmates. Is there any issues with having the celebration during asares yemei teshuva? Or it’s better to wait between YK and sukkos. We have married kids flying in for YK to CH and would love to coordinate celebration with their time here..
 ###answer 
 
In the Rebbe’s words (״  ׳ ):
Considering the specialty of the day (see Zohar Chadash Breshis 15, end of side d: On the day etc.) – it would be worthwhile that on the actual day of the Bar Mitzvah he should say words of Torah in the presence of (at least) ten Jews, and afterwards they should bless him etc. coming through “a sip which brings hearts closer together etc.” and this doesn’t contradict to afterwards arranging also as described in part 2 [making a celebration].
It is obvious that in this case one should consider the celebration done on the day itself as a key celebration (which should be celebrated with great simcha just as on the day of the wedding) and the later event just as an opportunity to celebrate with family and friends.
 ״  ׳ .  ׳ .  ׳ .  ׳ .  ׳ .  ׳ . .
In terms of making the later celebration during Aseres Yemei Teshuvah:
although it’s perfectly acceptable to celebrate happy events during these days (other then a wedding) it would be difficult to justify this in this case where the event was delayed from the original schedule time. Thus, it would be more appropriate to do it on Motzai Yom Kippur or on the following day or any of the subsequent days.###question 
  Are you allowed to open food packages on Shabbos?
Are you allowed to open food packages on Shabbos?
Specifically, these are the examples I am referring to:
Take off the plastic from chummus or cream cheese packages,
Open a bag of pretzels, Bissli, etc.
Take off the cover from a yogurt
Open the plastic from individually wrapped pieces of sliced American cheese
Obviously besides being careful not to cut the words….
 ###answer 
 
One should avoid opening or separating a bag/container sealed with glue, such as the items you mention in the question.
There are some lenient views when the item being opened is disposable and will be thrown away immediately (Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasa 9:4). However, it is the preferred approach to be stringent in this matter due to the concern that separating two pieces of paper or plastic stuck to each other is an issur of koreia (ripping). See Shulchan Aruch Admor Hazaken (Orach Chayim 340:17). See also Nesivim Bsdei Hashlichus vol. 2 p. 101 in the name of Rav Zalman Shimon Dvorkin Z”L.
A simple alternative would be to make a cut from the side, provided that you are not ripping any words or pictures.
This is only if it’s sealed with glue, but if it is just plain heat sealed – which is very common with today’s packaging – there won’t be an issue (especially with disposable packaging), though it’s still preferable to open it before Shabbos.
Follow up Question:
Is there a way to know which packaging is heat-sealed and which is glued? How are chips bags sealed, for example?
Answer:
I can’t say with certainty. However, if upon opening you see a thin layer of dried glue or any other sticky substances you would know it’s glued. In contrast, potato chips and most bags are usually heat sealed.###question 
 Do I need to wash on Shabbos day If I don’t want to? It’s too heavy etc…..
 ###answer 
 
Eating Challa by the Shabbos meals is of primary importance and should be practiced, unless there is a medical consideration.
The required amount per meal is only slightly more than the volume of an egg (see note1) and thus a healthy person shouldn’t feel too heavy from eating just that amount.
If there is a concern that one might not feel well (aside for usual tiredness) after eating this minimal amount, or it would cause pain, there would then be place to advise an alternative to eating an K’beitza of Challah, as there may be a medical consideration to take into account. In this case, one can suffice with eating only one Kazayis of bread. (Shulchan Aruch Admor Hazaken Orach Chayim 274:6.)
Additionally, there is the view of the Maharil (the Alter Rebbe’s brother) who testified that towards the end of his life the Alter Rebbe changed his earlier ruling and said that one fulfills the obligation of a “Seudah” for Shabbos also with Mezonos. This would only apply to baked Mezonos foods (  ), foods that when affixing a meal on it and eating the requisite amount would acquire the Bracha of Hamotzi. However this should only be relied on in cases of great need, not under ordinary circumstances.###question 
  Is there any rule or custom not to have your hair cut by a goy?.
 ###answer 
 There is a Halachic prohibition against getting a haircut from a non-Jew. This is brought in Mishnayos (Avoda Zarah: Perek 2 Mishna 2) and in Shulchan Aruch (Yorah Deya: Siman 156).
However, one may get a haircut from a Goy if it is in public with other people present or there are passersby, or if the one getting their haircut looks in the mirror during the haircut. It is not enough to be able to see in the mirror, rather one must actually look in the mirror in a noticeable way.
However, there are Kabalistic reasons for people to be Mehader to always refrain from using a non-Jewish barber if there is a Jewish option available.###question 
  When is the best time to make the Seudas Purim when Purim falls out on Friday?.
 ###answer 
 times are for NYC – 5781
The Purim se’udah is eaten in the morning, so that we do not disrespect Shabbos by entering the holy day too full to enjoy the Shabbos meal. It is best to begin the meal before chatzos (halachic midday) which is at 12:08 pm (in NYC), or at least before the tenth halachic hour of the day which is at approximately 2:56 pm (in NYC).
It is permissible to extend the meal so that it continues into the afternoon, even passing the tenth halachic hour of the day. At the same time, care must be taken to avoid eating until completely satiated—room must be left for the Shabbos meal that must be eaten with appetite.###question 
  What should I do with this Mezuzah?
I went to acquire a collection of Jewish books at a residency in Manhattan earlier this week. The library is comprised of both Jewish and Christian books amongst many radical theological and anti-Semitic and Jewish conspiracy theory propaganda books.
I didn’t meet the owner of the books, but I understand he’s Jewish and from what I can tell has been affiliated with JW as well as other Christian groups. I was told he also went to Shul, but I haven’t verified whether that is indeed the case.
On any note, amongst the Seforim I found a reasonable-looking Mezuzah and my question is what the status of this Mezuzah is. Can it potentially be used and if not how is it to be disposed of?.
 ###answer 
 
The Halacha is that one is in fact obligated to buy STA”M from a non-Jew who has them in his possession, to prevent it from being disgraced (although this may not be required in the case of a Jew – because he usually will not disgrace them). They should be bought even beyond their regular price, but not if overly expensive.
If one did buy them they should not be used, and should be placed in geniza (shaimos), as many times they have been written by unqualified people. Even when purchasing such items in general one must only purchase them from a G-D fearing individual, all the more so when the origins are unknown.

  How do we give women on Mivtzoim the opportunity to fulfil the Mitzvah of Mishloach Manos?.
 ###answer 
 Men or women should not give Mishloach Manos to someone from the opposite gender. You may give them Mishloach Manos on behalf of an organization and instruct them to pass it on to another Jewish woman. (Or you can just instruct them on how to do the Mitzva on their own.)
Another option:
A man can be a Shliach for a woman.
She should first acquire the Mishloach Manos through making a Kinyan, and then she should appoint the man as her Shliach to deliver it to another woman.###question 
  How can I say Hatov V’Hameitiv over wine at the Purim Seudah, or at a regular meal?.
 ###answer 
 When one has two wines, they should make a Beracha Boreh Pri Hagafen on the better wine, even if this means that they would not be able to make a Hatov V’Hameitiv.
If during the meal you drink from a second (different) bottle of wine, the Beracha of Hatov V’Hameitiv is recited if you are drinking together with company like with one’s family or friends and they are also partaking from both wines.
If it is necessary to make the Beracha of Boreh Pri Hagafen on the second wine, the Beracha of Hatov V’Hameitiv is recited first.
This is only if you are drinking from the second bottle because it has a better taste or quality, or even if you don’t know whether the second type is better, but not because the first bottle finished. In fact, you must have some of the first bottle left. If you know for a fact that the second wine is worse than the first, this bracha isn’t recited.
If the second wine is of lesser quality, the Beracha of Hatov V’Hameitiv is not said unless it is white wine and it is just a little worse in which case it is said. However, if the white wine is of such inferior quality which he would drink it with difficulty, the Beracha is not said.
The Beracha is not said if one was drinking white wine and then red wine unless one is sure that the second wine is better than the first. Similarly, the Beracha is not said if one was drinking old wine and then new wine unless one is sure that the second wine is as good as the first.
If you are bentching on the second wine, Hatov V’Hameitiv is not said.###question 
  I was asked by a modern orthodox shul to read megillah for them. Am I allowed to do it even though it will also be live on zoom? Do I have to make it clear that they do not fulfill their obligation?.
 ###answer 
 You may lein there, provided you make a disclaimer before you begin that according to the clear majority of Poskim one is not yotzeh with a Megillah reading heard over the phone or online.
PS  It’s obvious that even those who permitted it we’re not aware of the science and mechanics involved. Furthermore, even according to this opinion which has been rejected by virtually all mainstream Poskim, reading the Megillah via zoom is perhaps worse because there’s a time delay between the reading and the hearing.###question

  Can I use a sock to strain the tap water on Shabbos?
Many have a custom to keep a sock on their tap over Pesach, to make sure that no Chametz will come out of the tap, What should we do on Shabbos or Yom Tov?
I could think of two possible concerns:
1. The sock is clean, but the sock dries overnight and the water coming out of the tap is clean. Would this be an issue of Melaben?
2. It’s true that practically there Is no chance of actual Chametz coming out of the tap, but would we still have to be Choshesh for Borer?.
 ###answer 
 
It is best to use a strainer/filter manufactured especially for this purpose (sold in most Jewish stores that sell Pesach items).
If it is not attainable, you may use another type of cloth that you set aside for that, best if it is a white cloth.
P.S. A sock might not be the best idea, for practical reasons.###question 
 If I am not accomplishing anything more than a stranger, then I do not think I wish to continue. I have another few days until the shloshim is finished.

 ###answer 
 
There is an advantage of having someone who is a close relative saying kaddish. If however the money used to hire someone to say will come from the inheritance of the deceased that would be preferable.###question

 Is there a way to fulfill the inyan of learning a daf of sotah every day of sefira and at the same time save the last part of daf 49 (on erev shavuos) to do the siyum much later (such as during the 9 days)?.
 ###answer 
 
If you are just making the Siyum celebration on a later date, in order to add in Kavod Hatorah, that is okay, even if you finished earlier.
But for it to be considered a seudas mitzvah (for example to allow meat and wine in the nine days, or to fulfill the Rebbe’s directive to make siyumim in the nine days), then you will have to leave a few lines to learn then. If you do so, however, you will not be fulfilling the custom of concluding it before Shavuos.

Today is Friday. The last time to say Kiddush Levana this month will be on Motzai Shabbos. It looks like there will not be a Levana then. Can I do it tonight if there is no issue with carrying?.
 ###answer 
 
If you believe you’ll miss out on the chance to do it completely it may be done on Friday night. It should ideally be done from a Gemora – Sanhedrin 42a.
In this case, if done with a minyan, Kiddush Levana should be said (after nightfall but) before Maariv, if possible.###question

 ###answer 
 
The common custom is to tuck it in after placing the Shel Rosh. However, one should refrain from speaking until it is done.###question 
 1. The Alter Rebbe says (14;9) one can borrow a tallis without permission. The Aruch Hashulchan (14;12) says it is not allowed today when people put their tallis each in a private place. Does the Alter Rebbe agree with that point?
Some Poskim point out this heter does not apply nowadays when everyone has a talis koton, should we consider that chumra?.
 ###answer 
 
1. Possibly.
In practice, there is not much of a difference, because the entire halacha is dependent on the assumption whether the individual minds or not. If it’s somewhat clear that the owner does not want people to use it, then everyone agrees that its forbidden to use. On the other hand, if we know for a fact he doesn’t mind, one may even take it out from their private locker.
2. No. People wore Talis Koton then as well, and nevertheless we are still performing a Mitzva when wearing Talis Gadol.###question 
  Can I say Hamapil after taking off my socks?
Can I say Hamapil after taking off my socks? (I may have touched my feet), or must I get out of bed and wash Negel Vaser first to say this Bracha?
If I can say the bracha like that, can it be done L’Chatchila?
Can this be applied to touching other usually covered parts of the body, and in regards to other Brachos?.
 ###answer 
 
If you only touched your socks and not your feet, there is no need to wash your hands, unless you touch the section which is sweaty.
If you touched your feet, you should wash them. It doesn’t need to be Negel Vaser. But you should use some water. If impossible, rubbing your hands with anything that cleans them is sufficient.
Rubbing your hands with anything the cleans certainly qualify with regard to other body parts that are usually covered.
All this applies prior to all Brachos.###question 
  Can I automatically deduct Ma’aser from my paycheck?
If I work for an organization where I get paid on the basis of how much I work, am I able to clock less time than what I actually worked with the intention to give the unpaid money back to the organization as ma’aser?
For example, if I worked 10 hours, to earn $100, would I be allowed to just write that I worked for 9 hours, get paid $90, and be yotzei giving ma’aser?
And if the answer to the above is yes, what if I did that inadvertently?.
 ###answer 
 
For the mitzva of ma’aser, the main part is separating (see Likutei Sichos vol 2 pg. 652 and Sicha of Parashas Nasso 5748). Thus one should actually receive the full payment and then separate ma’aser from that.###question 
  Can a Man Daven in the Women’s Section?
Aside from the uncomfortable feelings of showing up at shul and seeing men on the women’s side… Is it even halachically allowed for men to Daven on the women’s side when no women are yet present, and what about when they do show up, does halacha require them to move?.
 ###answer 
 
A man is Halachically allowed to Daven in the women’s section as long as no women are present. If he knows that women are arriving soon, he should leave beforehand, and certainly once a woman arrives he must leave immediately. The exact arrangements should be worked out with the Rav and Gabai of the Shul.
Whether the man may be counted as part of the Minyan is a matter of dispute and depends largely on the setup of the Mechitza. Additionally, according to some opinions, the Women’s section is of lesser holiness than the rest of the Shul, although it would seem that this too depends if it’s the same room or not.

Is a man allowed to daven in the Ezras Nashim (if no women are present)?###question 
  Is it halachically forbidden to give away parts of Eretz Yisroel to the Arabs?
I don’t doubt the Rebbe’s words for a second, I am only asking so I can understand and explain to others:
We can’t give away parts of Eretz Yisroel because this is something that Hashem gave to us, the Jewish people. This is in short, I think, the Rebbe’s view on the topic. If so, how is this a reason for not giving away land? If someone gives me something, it is mine completely and I can do with it as I wish. If we were given Ba’alus over Eretz Yisroel, why can’t we give parts of or the whole land away? And if we don’t have such ability to do so, then what kind of gift is this?.
 ###answer 
 
Here are a few points to consider:
Eretz Yisroel was given to every single Jew, thus no government can decide to give it away.
Giving away parts of Eretz Yisroel affects the safety of those living there. This has been corroborated by military experts and is evident by the rockets being fired now, which would not reach so far if those areas were still populated by Jews. The Rebbe often quoted Shulchan Aruch 329, from where we can see the importance of cities near the border.
Giving away parts of Eretz Yisroel displays a sign of weakness. It’s not a struggle about the land per se, rather it’s about our very existence. Any withdrawal from land is a withdrawal on our rights to exist as the Jewish People.###question 
  May I wear a kippa clip on Shabbos?
Full Question:
May I wear a kippa clip on Shabbos? Even when it’s not attached to my hair? Like the clip on the inside of the kippa?.
 ###answer 
 
When it is not being used for a purpose, such as  to connect it to the hair so that it shouldn’t fall off one’s head it should not be carried on Shabbos.###question 
  Can a woman play an instrument in public?
A lady who recently became observant used to play a musical instrument and give concerts in front of a general, mixed audience. Is it OK to continue doing so, or is it not tznius? She does not sing..
 ###answer 
 
First of all, it is forbidden for anyone to perform for, or attend a performance in, a mixed audience.
Additionally, it is forbidden for women to perform in front of men. This refers to doing any special skills that can attract the attention of men to their movements. This is part of the prohibition of “in front of a blind person do not place a stumbling block”, since it may cause them to have inappropriate thoughts.
Also, it’s not the way of tznius for a woman to be in the center of attention in public. Chazal have praised the Jewish women that are modest and inward and don’t seek the limelight.###question 
  Is one allowed to study on Shabbos for a test?.
 ###answer 
 Can I study on Shabbos for a test on Limudei Kodesh subjects?
Allowed.
 ”      ,   .
    –  ”     .
Can I study on Shabbos for an accounting test?
No.
Explanation: There are two issues here:
One is reading such material on Shabbos. It is permissible to read books of wisdom on Shabbos according to the strict letter of the law but a G-d-fearing person should be stringent. However, since accounting is forbidden on Shabbos, this would not be considered studying wisdom.
An additional issue is hachanah, preparation for after Shabbos.

  If I make a batch of Challah dough and make a Bracha, must I bake all of the dough at the same time?.
 ###answer 
 You don’t have to (though some are particular about this).###question 
 What is the reason that these days we try not to do that if it’s brought down in Shulchan Aruch?.
 ###answer 
 
One should in fact reproach the Baal Koreh when he makes a mistake that doesn’t require him to go back, such as a change of the trop etc. (When making a mistake that requires him to go back, he should be told to do so in any case).
This should be done in a peaceful way, not through “screaming” etc., being careful not to embarrass the Baal Koreh (or anyone else) ch”v.###question 
 I saw someone write that opening up a bottle cap on Shabbos is permitted even if there is writing on it, basing himself on the Alter Rebbe’s position (in his Shulchan Aruch, Laws of Shabbos 340:4) who permits opening up a book with words on the side. Do you agree with this conclusion?.
 ###answer 
 
In theory, yes, as long as it’s still possible to put the letters together in such a way that they are legible. In other words, if it has been totally destroyed it is not permissible.
Nonetheless, in practice, one should attempt not to break in the area where there are letters. Moreover, in the first instance one should ensure to open it before Shabbos.
Note that the Ketzos Hashulchan (144:3) asserts that this leniency (regarding opening books with letters) is primarily about when one finds himself in such a circumstance on Shabbos. However, one should not print such books in the first place. Similarly, if one owns such a book, he should cut the letters off before Shabbos so that he is not faced with this situation on Shabbos. [Similarly, see the Mishnah Brurah (340:17) and Shaar Hatziyon 25].###question 
  Do you need to Toivel dishes made in a studio where you paint your own pottery?
If someone goes to a store that sells Keilim and they paint and then the store heats up the keli to finish it off and make it usable. Would that require tevila?.
 ###answer 
 
It depends:
If you are creating the vessel from scratch, such as modeling, etc. (in addition to painting) it, it does not require Tevilah.
If, however, you are merely painting a vessel which is already in a usable condition, then the following conditions apply. Any of the lenient points below (either in A or B) exempt the vessel from the requirement of Tevilah and/or Brocha.
A- Ownership of the store/factory:
If the store/factory is Jewishly owned and the workers are Jewish, its products do not require Tevilah. If the workers are non-Jewish, its products require Tevilah but without reciting a Brocha.
If the store/factory is not Jewishly owned, its products require Tevilah with a Brocha.
B- Type of Keilim:
Earthenware utensils do not require Tevilah unless they are coated with glass or metal (which are materials that require Tevilah), as detailed right below.
➣ Coated with glass: It should be Toiveled without reciting a Brocha.
➣ Coated with metal: If the Kli has merely a coating made from metal, it should be Toiveled without reciting a Brocha. By contrast, if the entire surface (interior and exterior) is coated with metal, not merely for aesthetic appeal, it should be Toiveled with a Brocha.###question 
  May one brush a Sheitel on Shabbos?.
 ###answer 
 It is only permitted if one uses a brush that doesn’t rip out hairs. Preferably one should set aside a special brush for Shabbos use only. Additionally, if the sheitel is only wearable if brushed, one should not brush it even if there is no possibility of ripping our hair.###question 
  Is it permissible to make a Mi Shebeirach for a sick non-Jew? If yes, how can it be done?.
 ###answer 
 Yes, but not together in the same Mi Shebeirach as Jews.
This is permitted in the case where he is favorably disposed towards Jews, or where appropriate due to Darchei Shalom.

 I have a question regarding my grandmother’s yartzeit. My grandmother passed away on the 20th of April 2021. Shkia that Tuesday was 7:46 PM and the official time of death as quoted on the death certificate was 7:55 PM. I would like to know which day we should go by for her yortzeit, the 8th of Iyar or the 9th?.
 ###answer 
 
The 9th of Iyar.
But one should also keep minhagei yahrtzeit on the first day. Nonetheless, one is not a chiyuv then and cannot override a chiyuv’s obligation to daven for the amud.###question 
  Do we need to avoid eating on plastic Keilim at the houses of those that do not Toivel their plastic Keilim?
What if they offer to toivel their new plastic cups for us, should we ask that they do so?.
 ###answer 
 
If you are stringent to toivel plastic, you may eat the food but not off the plates. Rather, it should be removed to another toiveled plate first.
Of course, it’s better if they actually go and immerse them.
If these options are impractical, there is room to be lenient and eat off the plates, especially when eating dry foods.###question 
  What should be done with the Orla after a Bris Milah?
If after a Brit Mila the mohel gives the Orla to someone to bury, what’s the exact procedure how to do & where?
Do you have to say any verses or pesukim while doing it? I heard a mohel said something to say but not sure what. Is there any segula in this?.
 ###answer 
 
The orla should preferably be first placed in a vessel, a cup or the like, with sand or dirt covering it on top and on the bottom, and then buried anywhere one wishes. Some add water too. No need for anything to be recited during the burial.###question 
  Do we need to put up a Mezuzah on our new home which we didn’t move into yet?
We purchased our home a couple of months ago. We didn’t move into the house yet, nor did we bring any of our belongings in (because there is a possibility that we will be renting it out for some time). However, we did bring a Chitas and a pushka into the kitchen right away. Should we/do we need to put up mezuzos on the house?.
 ###answer 
 
No.
You should put up the mezuzos with a bracha only when you move in or move in your belongings for regular usage.###question 
 And is there a difference between an indoor Waterpark to an outdoor one?
Or can one sit on the side and learn from a sefer?
If I can learn myself, can I also speak to someone else about learning? ( …).
 ###answer 
 
Yes, one may learn in the waterpark. Lechatchilah his top half should be covered appropriately.
Even better would be to be dressed appropriately when learning, but one shouldn’t be mevatel Torah because of this. Therefore, you should learn Torah despite not being fully dressed.
There is no difference between an indoor Waterpark to an outdoor one.
One may also sit on the side and learn from a sefer.
Regarding speaking to others:
According to strict Halacha when he is wearing a bathing suit that is tight around his waist there is no issue. However, it’s appropriate that this other person should have his top half covered appropriately as well.###question 
  Can I leave a grill outdoors, or we’re worried a Goy might use it?
Questions:
I’m renting an Airbnb in a non-Jewish neighborhood for a few days.
Is it a problem to leave a grill outdoors while I’m sleeping/not at home in a neighborhood that it seems unlikely that anyone will just come into the property and use it?
What’s the halacha if, after the fact, I forgot to bring the grill in and in the morning everything looked like I left it the previous night?.
 ###answer 
 
In both cases it’s fine.###question 
  Can I fry in a Fleishig Deep Fryer during the 9 days?.
 ###answer 
 Q. If I have a deep fryer, in which chicken was fried, thus rendering the oil Fleishig, is it permissible to use that oil to fry something Parve during the 9 days?
A. No. The general rule is that anything considered Fleishig that one would have to wait to eat Milchigs (see here in regards to this case), may not be eaten in the nine days.
 ”   ”  ” ”  ” ” ”:   ”  ”  ”              ”  ” ” ” ”.
Q. What if the deep fryer was cleaned thoroughly and new oil supplies? Would that make a difference? 
A. Yes, then it would be allowed.###question 
  When out on the road & using a prayer direction app, which opinion does Chabad use to determine the direction of Yerushalayim?
See the attachment for the shitos that are presented as options.
 ###answer 
 
Accepted Chabad practice appears to follow the Rhumb Line bearing.
Explanation: 
This matter is a Machlokes Achronim. In Shulchan Oruch (Orach Chaim 94:2), the Alter Rebbe describes the exact calculations to make, and these appear to conform to the Great Circle Bearing (see Simas Ayin page 5 onward, Kovetz Yagdil Torah volume 6 page 52 onwards). In the Siddur (D”H Bitfilas), the Alter Rebbe gives approximate bearings towards Yerushalayim for Northern European cities (150° SE), and although they don’t exactly conform to either bearing (see Simas Ayin for a proposed explanation for this discrepancy), it is closer to the Great Circle Bearing than the Rhumb Line bearing (if we assume the Alter Rebbe is focused on Poland/Lithuania/Belarus).
Despite this, 770 follows a Rhumb Line bearing (as observed in Kovetz Yagdil Torah) and this seems to be the widespread practice among Chabad. (To use some extreme examples, both Honolulu and Anchorage need to face West using the Rhumb Line bearing, but would need to face North using the Great Circle bearing.) It may also be observed that the Alter Rebbe’s calculations were for Northern European cities, where there is generally not much of a discrepancy between these two types of bearings.
Either way, the Alter Rebbe in his Siddur was satisfied with providing very rough approximations (150° SE for all of Northern Europe) and did not mandate any further precision. This would imply that one does not have to face Yerushalayim at an extremely precise angle, but just its general direction.###question 
 Is there any specific behavior to follow during weekdays or Shabbos Birkat Kohanim in Sefardi minyan? I’ve seen some leave the room for that time..
 ###answer 
 
There is no reason to leave if you are listening and receiving the Bracha, and on the contrary, one should davka stay. (On occasion the Rebbe spoke of the benefit all Yidden recive from the daily birchas kohanim of the Sfardim).###question 
 Is it permitted to ask a non-Jew to plug in the pot? If it permitted to hint it to her?
We had children by the meal. Technically they could eat cold food, but they would be much happier eating hot meat. If that’s considered tzar for them, if they don’t have hot cholent and therefore we could have the goy put it on?
Did the fact that the cholent was still warm make a difference, or is the solution with cold cholent as well?
Does the fact that guests are coming make a difference? How about Kavod habrius? It would a) be embarrassing for a wife to just serve cold food to the guests b) not be so nice to the guests to give them a sub par meal..
 ###answer 
 
No.
But if you have a stovetop that’s covered with a Blech, you may move the cholent pot directly there, while it’s warm enough to the extent that a person would have enjoyment eating it like that. However, there should be another separation between Blech and pot.

  Can I have a Goy take my temperature on Shabbos so I can get into the hospital for Mivtzoim?
Many hospitals and nursing homes require that temperature be taken from each visitor when they enter. One of their staff members takes the temperature with a digital thermometer that is placed on the forehead or arm of each visitor.
Is it ok to allow them to do this? Especially if the visit is also to perform a mitzvah with the patient (Shofar, Lulav, etc.).
 ###answer 
 
Yes, if it’s indeed for a Mitzvah purpose since it is done by a non-Jew.###question 
 The Sefer Torah fell out from the Aron Kodesh in our Yeshiva (no one was touching it – it just slipped onto the doors and the doors swung open) onto the floor r”l. It was covered with its mantel. What do the bochurim who were in the room when it happened, and those who were in a nearby room and saw it, need to do? What about those who weren’t there and didn’t see it? And bichlal what is the proper chassidishe way to react to such a situation?.
 ###answer 
 
Those who actually saw it falling:
Should fast two half days.1
Fasting should only be done if it doesn’t affect their health or learning
They should additionally give Tzedaka, equivalent to the cost of meals of two days.
The other students:
Do not need to fast, even if they saw it when it was on the floor.
This applies only if it was put back properly, to begin with.
All students:
Should take upon themselves to be diligent in Shnaim Mikrah Vaechad Targum this year, and give extra Tzedaka, preferably the equivalent of one day of meals.
The hanholas hayeshiva should make a kinus hisorerus with hachlatos to be extra careful in kedushas sefer Torah, including silence during kriah, and properly respecting sifrei kodesh.

  Do I say Tefilas Haderech the day I begin traveling back home?
I live in California and I’m taking a road trip from New York to my home over the next few days, when and how often do I say Tefilas Haderech?.
 ###answer 
 
You should say Tefilas Haderech every day (since after the day you left your original home) after davening without Shem U’malchus, which means that you finish off the Bracha by saying “Barouch atah shomea tefilah“.
Tefilas Haderech with Shem U’malchus is only said on the first day of your trip when leaving your original home. After that (including the day(s) traveling back home) you should say it only without Shem U’malchus.

The custom of the Rebbe Rashab N”E was to say Teffilas Haderech every day he was away from home without Shem U’malchus…###question 
  Can a Goyishe helper turn on the fire and cook at home if a Jew is in the kitchen?
I am tutoring a teenage boy from a traditional sfardic family. We learned halachos of bishul Yisroel and I told him that a non-Jew may not turn the fire on.
After we finished the mother called me and said that she once asked a rov who said that a goyishe helper may turn on the fire and cook at home if someone else is with them in the house or kitchen at the same time.
What is the correct answer for this woman?.
 ###answer 
 
A Goy may turn on the fire if the cooking is being done entirely by a Yid. This means that the fire is being lit before the Yid places the pot on the stove or before the food is put in the pot which is already on the stove etc.
True there is an opinion that allows for non-Jewish workers to put on the fire in a Jewish home. However, even so, there is a debate whether this opinion addresses only slaves who belong to their master, or even to workers who are hired for the job, but have no choice in the matter and must work for the boss and cook for him.
Regardless, this is only one opinion and should certainly not be relied upon l’chatchillah.###question 
  Are siblings (brothers and sisters) allowed to dance together at a wedding?.
 ###answer 
 The Halacha is that a brother may not hug or kiss a sister or vice versa. This applies to any type of affectionate physical contact between them.
Dancing together is considered affectionate physical contact. So many poskim have decried the practice of mixed dancing due to the physical contact between the genders. It follows that brother and sister too may not have such type of physical contact. Indeed, this is spelled out clearly in a number of contemporary sources indicated below.
See also the attached from “A guide to Chabad Weddings“, recently published by Mikvah.org and approved by multiple Rabbonei Anash.
This is also why husband and wife are not to be dancing with each other in the presence of others, since dancing together is considered affectionate behavior and they are not to show their affection for each other in the presence of other people.
Furthermore, even the holy practice of mitzvah tantz was abolished in Chabad, as the Rebbe wrote, because we have seen in practice what has happened as a result of this in so many weddings. Certainly, a dance among family, not in the context of the mitzvah tantz should not be done. How much more so when this is done in the presence of other people, which creates immoral thoughts. This is in addition to the fact that naturally this means either women being in the men’s section or men being in the women’s section. Such behavior undermines the purpose of the mechitza at the wedding.###question 
  How does one daven on a moving bus?.
 ###answer 
 One who can’t daven towards Yerushalaim should turn at least his face towards Yerushalayim if possible. Regardless, he should have in mind as he starts davening Shemone Esrei that his tefillos are ascending via the Holy of holies. If the vehicle changes directions and turning his face distracts his kavanah, he should position himself properly when he starts Shemone Esrei and have in mind as above, as well as directing his heart to Hashem.###question 
  Are you supposed to say Krias Shema in the morning with Tefillin?.
 ###answer 
 While it’s best to wear tefillin when saying Shema before davening, especially if one will be eating afterwards, one may say Shema without Tefilin as long as he will be putting on Tefilin later in the day during Shema. The Rebbe says that this is the common practice today and explains the halachic basis for this in the sicha noted in the sources below. However, there are those who are makpid to say the first Shema of the day in Tefilin.###question 
  Is a storage unit obligated in a Mezuzah?
I have a storage unit that I visit once every 5 years, it is likely dirty inside the unit but there are boxes with seforim inside among other things. I put a mezuzah on the unit when I had first acquired it. Do I have any kind of obligation to ensure that the mezuzah stays up or is kosher? Does the unit even need a mezuzah?.
 ###answer 
 
Yes, even if you visit only infrequently it is still required to have a Mezuzah since you might go there when you need to.
This is provided the unit is large enough to be obligated to have a Mezuza (6.29ft by 6.29ft or 39.68 square ft.). A Bracha is not recited when affixing a mezuzah there.###question 
  What are Halachic considerations when going about using a pergola as a Sukkah?
Some details that might be of importance:
It has not been built yet. This is for someone who wants to construct one now. They need basic kashrus, no extra chumros.
I also want to build one as well and want it to be lchatchilah.
Here is a pic for illustration purposes..
 ###answer 
 
There are a few points to have in mind when turning a pergola into a Sukkah:
1) Material of the support for the S’chach:
From the picture it looks like it will be wooden beams – that is totally fine and the S’chach may lie directly on them. Otherwise, if it’s something which is not Kosher for S’chach, such as made of a material which is susceptible to Tum׳ah (e.g., metal), the S’chach should (lechatchila) be supported by wooden slats or the like.
2) Width of the beams vs. the space between them:
The width of the space between beams (where the S’chach will be visible from inside the Sukkah) must be at least as wide as the beams themselves. Again, from the picture it appears that this is not an issue at all.
3) Space between the beams:
There is a Chumra that the crossbeams should be at least 3 Tefachim (24cm) apart from each other. But this is not the halacha. See details here:
Regarding a Sukkah, the cross beams in the picture below are more than 3 Tefachim apart…###question 
 The question is this: Last time I wrote a check was last January. I’m running out of $20 bills, so it’s getting time to write a check again. However, a new Chabad House opened up closer to home. I’ve been thinking that I should start filling another pushka so that some of the coins in that pushka will be reserved for when I write a check to the new Chabad House. But a few weeks ago I started thinking that perhaps I can split the funds from the one pushka. Being that I thought of this only recently, and for most of the time since January I had in mind that I would be writing a check to the older Chabad House, can I split the funds in half and write an equal check to each Chabad House? Or should I write a check to only the older Chabad House since that is what I initially had in mind?.
 ###answer 
 
The check should be written to the older Chabad house whom you got the pushka from.
If you wish you can get another pushka from the new Chabad house which will be donated to them.
Question:
After writing the check to the older Chabad House whom I got the pushka from, can I have in mind that any future donations to the pushka will go to the new Chabad House? Or should donations using that pushka only go to the older Chabad House since the pushka was gifted to me from them?
Answer:
You shouldn’t use the pushka for donations to a different cause, as the pushka technically still belongs to the institution which gave it to you. Although some argue that the pushka is considered a gift and is now yours, it can be argued that it was gifted with the understanding that you will only use it for the original cause.###question 
  Are there Niggunim that cannot be sung on Shabbos?.
 ###answer 
 Avinu Malkeinu is not said on Shabbos. The minhag is not to sing the nigun either.
Haneiros Halalu (rather just the last phrase “al nisecha…” Is sung).
Hamavdil bein kodesh lechol (and other Motzaei Shabbos nigunim).
Sad tunes such as the tune of Eicha and Kinos.###question 
  Is Gluten-Free Challah Hamotzie?
I’m baking a gluten-free challah recipe for a guest. I’m not sure how to know if the recipe would be hamotzie or not. The ingredients include: brown rice flour, oat flour, arrowroot, and the liquid is almond milk.
What are the options for eating this in place of traditional challah? Is it ok to wash on? Or should they wash on a bite of regular challah and then eat a lot of this gluten-free bread to make up a halachic amount? How should they bentch?.
 ###answer 
 
Since the liquid is almond milk the challah is mezonos up to shiur kvius seuda.###question 
  Is “The Emotion Code” allowed according to Torah?
Hi Rabbi Braun,
I would like to try a method called “The Emotion Code” by Bradly (Brad) Nelson to try to figure out what’s bothering me and the cause.
The method is supposed to “release trapped emotions in the body that cause stress and disfunctionality.”
Many of my friends use this method and it has helped them.
They can actually do this test by speaking with a practitioner over the phone.
Is this allowed according to Torah?
Thank you.
 ###answer 
 
There are many alternative healing methods (as well as meditations) out there that are based on ancient Indian or Chinese tradition, for example, acupuncture, reiki, yoga and mindfulness.
Included in this is the emotion code developed By Dr. Bradley Nelson some 20 years ago, which he clearly states is based off Chinese and Indian tradition, of energies that exist in the world and body, which you can tap into with physical activity as well.
Though this does not necessarily mean that its basis is Avoda Zara, there is definitely room for concern. Upon some research, it appears furthermore that Bradley Nelson attributes receiving his ideas, through prayer to his deity, and he mentions how in the emotion code you’ll find certain ideas which exist in x-tianity (which lav davka can’t be taken from Torah either).
This can also be a serious reason for concern.###question 
  May one eat on a flight during Sukkos?
I have a flight on Chol Hamoed to come to the Rebbe for Simchas Torah. Is there any reason not to eat on the flight? (I was thinking that this petur of osek bemitzva may be different than the petur of mitztaer where we are nevertheless machmir, as over here the choice is eating or not eating, vs by mitztaer the choice is eating in a sukkah or outside a sukkah, amongst other possible differences.).
 ###answer 
 
One shouldn’t fast – certainly not past midday – but should eat non mezonos foods.
Please see here:
Can I drink outside of the Sukkah if I am very thirsty?
I should add that it is not at all recommended to fast on a flight from a health point of view for fear of dehydration etc.
P.S. Indeed, generally speaking, a person who’s traveling is usually exempt from eating in the Sukkah, especially when doing so to fulfill a Mitzvah. However, in regards to the Minhag Chassidim in general, there are two independent points:
1) to eat in the Sukkah even when it’s raining and not comfortable etc.
2) not to eat or drink anything (even water) outside the Sukkah.###question 
  Can I answer a question untruthfully if I’m embarrassed to share the truth?
Is there room to answer a question untruthfully if you are embarrassed to share the truth? In a case of casual conversation where no one is being affected by what you say..
 ###answer 
 
Yes, it could be allowed, as long as no one is being affected, including yourself (an example of hurting yourself or causing undeserved “gain” could be when being untruthful about yourself to your employer, teacher, or parents), and even then it’s better to be ambiguous.
Still, a person should always distance himself from saying anything untruthful. Certainly, this shouldn’t become a habit.
If someone has prior issues with saying the truth the dispensation doesn’t apply.###question 
 What about the night of Erev Yom Kippur, before Ashmores Haboker (by keeping my kids up only till tzeis). Does that take preference over the other (early) options? As it is evening and not a “time of Chesed”?.
 ###answer 
 
Following is the order of preference of when to do Kaporos:
Ashmores Haboker of Erev Yom Kippur – See here.
Early morning of Erev Yom Kippur. Note that this was Rebbe’s minhag many years (even after netz).
Any other time of Erev Yom Kippur night or day.
On the 8th of Tishrei (when it’s not on Shabbos).
Any time during Aseres Yemei Teshuva.
In points 4 and 5 – closest to Erev Yom Kippur, the better.
Also, note that option 5 with a chicken is better than doing option 1 with money – see here:
What is preferred – Kaporos on Friday with chickens or on Sunday (Erev Yom Kippur) with money?

  Are you supposed to unplug your hot water machine before Yom Kippur?.
 ###answer 
 No need, especially if it’s usually on throughout the week.
Regardless, food may remain cooking over Yom Kippur if it will be used on Yom Kippur itself, such as for children, unhealthy people, etc., or for a weak person who needs it right after Yom Kippur, or when being prepared for a Shul.

If someone is Davening in a shul by themselves, should they take out the Sefer Torah for hoshaanos and put it on the Bima, or is it only taken out betzibur?.
 ###answer 
 
They shouldn’t take out the Sefer Torah but should circle the bimah.###question

  Can I consider accepting a job in the field of Law enforcement if it may require me to testify against a Jew?
I am considering a career in law enforcement as a forensic accountant. This means that I would be gathering financial evidence to be used in litigation proceedings. Depending on the job, this may only entail analyzing transactions and preparing reports for the attorneys, or it may involve actually testifying and presenting the evidence in court. While some cases may involve only monetary penalties if a party is found guilty, other cases may come with a prison term.
There is obviously the likelihood of potentially working on cases involving Jews. Although, this may also depend on the type and location of the job. For example, a forensic accountant at the FBI’s division of counterterrorism in Washington DC will probably work on few, if any, cases involving Jews, whereas if one works for the Manhattan District Attorney in New York, the likelihood greatly increases.
What would I need to consider before accepting a job in this field? I know that there might be an issue relating to mesirah? Are there other halachic considerations as well? Any guidance and resources will be greatly appreciated..

  Can a Woman Read the Megillah?
A community member’s daughter is becoming Bas Mitzva on Purim. He will be making the event- for girls only- in the local Lubavitch hall.He wants very much that his daughter lein the megillah for them.
Does the shul need to stop him (because of “    “    )?.
 ###answer 
 
This must certainly be stopped. This is strictly prohibited. Besides for what is written about megillah specifically, any behavior which seeks to achieve equality between men and women is foreign to Torah. This is especially true nowadays where the Reform movement has adopted such practices.
From the Torah perspective, men and women have completely different roles and one must be careful not to blur the lines between the unique roles and responsibilities each one of them have. It can also be considered a breach of tznius.
Instead, the Bas mitzvah girl should share a Dvar Torah with the female guests at the event in a modest a befitting manner.

  Correct Nusach in Benching:   or  ?
Is there a source for us saying   instead of   in bentching?
Is it something everyone should do? If yes, is there a reason that it doesn’t say it like that in the siddur?.
 ###answer 
 
There is a letter of the Rebbe stating that the correct wording is “Ol Hagoyim”. And indeed that is what should be said.
Nonetheless, in the Alter Rebbe’s Siddur, in most prints, it said “Ol Galus” and the nusach in our siddurim follow the same nusach and it was not changed.###question

You may light the remaining candle(s) directly from another Shabbos candle which was already lit, but not light a match from it.
Alternatively, you may strike a new match to light the remaining candle(s).

  Can I mourn my unborn baby?.
 ###answer 
 Question:
When it comes to the laws of a , the halacha is that there is no , and the custom is that the parents have no involvement in the burial, etc.
For many parents, this is very difficult, that they have no way to mourn. It is as if they are being told: “nothing happened”. Is there any explanation (with a source) that can help to soothe their pain? Is there a source to the thought that the  is so high and special that our  will not help  ?
Amswer:
Clearly, the Torah recognizes that the loss of a pregnancy is painful for the parents. This is obvious from a number of sources referenced below. However, The Torah ritual of mourning is not intended to be an expression of the sadness we feel. Indeed, the Torah rituals in general are not there for the purpose of expressing our feelings. While they do provide a decent framework for appropriate human feelings, that is not the ultimate purpose of the ritual. With regard to mourning specifically, it is true that the Torah practices of mourning provide an individual with a reasonable framework to ensure that one is not excessive in the mourning nor callous, nonetheless, it has nothing to do with how we feel about the matter. This is evident in the fact that one is required to practice certain mourning rituals, despite the fact that often they are not inducing sadness, nor an expression of sadness, rather a major inconvenience (such as not taking a haircut for a specific amount of time, etc.). Furthermore, the mourning laws apply, even in the case where a person doesn’t experience any sadness at all and rather might even be happy due to the negative relationship he has had with a relative. Furthermore, at times one is expected to put aside their sadness because it interferes with other Torah obligations even while the ritual of mourning might still be present.
It may be said that the Torah rituals are here for us to make sure that our practices are in sync with the divine desire. They are also symbolic that which occurs in the heavenly world when a soul departs from the body.
Additionally, the mourning in the Torah is not an expression of sadness but rather a result of the fact that there is now a vacuum in the world. This vacuum specifically relates to someone who had a mission to accomplish and can no longer do so.
In the case of a pregnancy loss, while it is extremely difficult for the parents, from the Torah’s perspective, this was a special soul who only came here for a short visit and its purpose is to return to its original Source, to be united with Hashem.
This perspective does not diminish in any way the extent of the pain of the parents or other relatives. After all, human beings who live in this world see everything from the human perspective. Thus, they may be sad and mourn – and ought to do so – but there’s no Halachic obligation of mourning.
If one wishes to practice the actual Torah laws of mourning in such a case, they may do so, as long it doesn’t conflict with any other Torah laws. The general rule that one should not mourn excessively obviously applies here too.
Kaddish should therefore not be said.###question 
  Does the Halacha of not walking between two palm trees apply only if there are dates growing on them or even if not?.
 ###answer 
 There’s no conclusive evidence one way or another about this topic. If, however, it’s a type of tree that naturally cannot produce dates, it would not be considered a palm tree.
P.S. If there’s a public thoroughfare between the two trees, there is more room for leniency. Moreover, if they are not parallel to each other or if they’re more than four Amos apart, it is not an issue in any case.###question

  What is the Halacha regarding Hefsek for Devarim Shebikdusha during Bentching?.
 ###answer 
 Question:
While learning through some of the halachos of hefsek betfillah, I’ve come across some arguments and uncertainties, and I’d like to ask Harav Braun Shlita if he can please clarify halacha l’maase what the Halacha is regarding Hefsek for Devarim Shebikdusha, Modim, etc. during bentching (including the fourth Bracha – if it is any different).
Amswer:
One should not make a hefsek in benching also for Devarim Shebikdusha, just like in Shmonei Esrei. However, one may answer Amen to the Bracha of the mezamen between one Bracha and the next.
During the fourth Bracha one may be mafsik like in psukei dezimra.###question

 Are pringles with an OU Fine?
I spoke to one of the Rabbonim who told me that when they cook the potato to make it into potato starch they put all kinds of things in it that makes it not edible. It’s never in a situation that someone can eat it as mashed potatoes. Based on that it would seem that Pringles should have no issue with Bishul Yisroel, not even like Potato chips for it’s not made from potato but from the starch.
Can this issue be looked into again?.
 ###answer 
  
I am not convinced that the information is accurate, nor am I convinced that adding ingredients to make it inedible will help in this case, especially if the ingredients are added after the cooking process has reached the stage of maachal ben drusai.

I called the OU, and I was told that the potatoes are cooked with steam, not in the regular way. So this might change your position about bishul yisroel Potato Chips and Pringles.

 I know the Rabbonim aren’t responsible for every rumor in their name, but being that this is something that can affect many women and I don’t want to make decisions based on rumors and hearsay, I just wanted to clarify, have the Rabbonim been getting a higher-than-normal amount of Shaalos from women who got vaccinated lasting for more than 1-2 cycles after the shot? And are there any concerns regarding Taharas Hamishpacha with getting the vaccine?.
 ###answer 
 
This information is incorrect. From my personal experience and after investigation with other rabbonim too, there is absolutely no basis for this rumor. This has been verified with Rabbonim who work specifically in the area of answering taharas hamishpacha questions full time, fielding Taharas Hamishpacha Hotlines, and heading a Beis Hora’ah for taharas hamishpacha matters.
There are many rumors, lies, half-truths and propaganda out there. In this matter specifically, I’ve heard so-called “reliable sources” quoting in the name of a particular well-known Rav, who deals regularly with taharas hamishpacha that he has seen such issues, only to find out upon investigation directly with him, that he too states that in his experience – as well as his investigation with others – this is untrue.
As always, I suggest that any information relating to medical issues such as vaccines should be gleaned from medical professionals and doctors. When there are conflicting opinions, as in any other matter, one should follow the majority opinion, the consensus established by mainstream doctors. This is the general halachic viewpoint, and particularly when it comes to medical issues.
This is all the more critical nowadays when there is an alarming rise in conspiracy theories on social media. The non-discerning individual, and many of us belong to that category, particularly if not steeped in a solid medical education, would have a difficult time being able to separate fact from fiction. Therefore, the first rule of thumb is not to believe anything shared about medical issues and everything must be checked and verified with the professionals.

  Are there any halachic concerns with using a “crock pot plastic bag”?
I want to use a “crock pot plastic bag” to line the pot to prevent it from getting dirty – are there any halachic concerns with using these plastic bags?
(I also have a thin layer of foil around the heating element (under the actual pot) used as a blech)..
 ###answer 
 
Using a crockpot liner poses an issue of Hatmana. However, there won’t be an issue if there is a noticeable space between the majority of the bag and the pot’s walls. This can be achieved by either using a smaller bag that doesn’t touch the sides of the pot or not folding over the bag on two or more sides. Additionally, if using water, one must ensure that most of the bag is not immersed in the water.###question 
  Should I cover the Bayis of the Tefillin Shel Yad with my sleeve?.

  Is there a problem to walk by, or look at, a church?
Is there a problem to walk by a church? Is it best to cross the street? What if crossing the street is out of your way?
Also, there is an inyan to avoid looking at a church, correct?.
 ###answer 
 
The custom by Jews was to take detours to avoid passing in front of a church, and Jewish mothers taught their children to not even look at a cross.
(Parenthetically, the Rebbe mentioned this in regards to having a TV, and said that by having a TV one is bringing the church, priest and cross into the house R”L (see Likkutei Sichos vol. 18 pg. 460)).
In practice, we saw the Rebbe walking past the church on Brooklyn Ave without crossing over.

  Tashlumin for Shabbos Shacharis: Before or After Musaf?
If one missed the time for Shacharis on a Shabbos or Yom Tov, how do they daven? Do you say Mincha first or Musaf first?.
 ###answer 
 
Musaf. Then Mincha, and then tashlumin for Shacharis.
If the time of Mincha arrived, Mincha takes precedence. In this case, Mincha is first, then Musaf, and then tashlumin for Shacharis.
Mincha takes precedence only after the time of Mincha Ketana has arrived. However, even before this, from the time of Mincha Gedolah, one must daven Mincha first, in the event that for whatever reason he must daven both tefillos now, for example, if as he is about to begin a full meal thereafter. Regardless, l’chatchillah one should always ensure that he davens Musaf early enough before the time of Mincha Gedola to avoid this issue.###question

  Is there an Inyan in saying Hallel with the Minyan?.
 ###answer 
 Yes.
One should make an extra effort to be holding with the Minyan for Hallel. The Rebbe once told someone who was accustomed to daven be’arichus that he should begin prior to the Minayn so that when they reach Hallel he should be holding with them. Similarly, the Rebbe writes in Igros Kodesh: ”Despite the fact that our Rebbeim would extend their Shabbos prayers over many hours – long after the congregation had concluded the service – they would nevertheless organize their time on Yom Tov so that they would conclude the amidah with the congregation and then recite Hallel together with them”.
This applies not only to Rosh Chodesh (and other times we recite chatzi Hallel), when there is a safek in regards to the proper way the Bracha on Hallel should be recited, but also to Chanukah and other Yomim Tovim -when regardles a Bracha on Hallel is said because the complete Hallel is recited- for there are other reasons that Hallel should be recited with the Minayn (namely, to answer  and  with the Minyan; it is more honorable to praise Hashemin public; to publicise the miracles we are praising Hashem for).###question 
 What is the proper order for Kriah this coming Shabbos – Shabbos, Rosh Chodesh, Chanukah – in a place where there is only 2 Sifrei Torah?
Which sefer to use for the Chanukah Kriah and when to be golel?.
 ###answer 
 
The Maftir (Chanukah) should be read from the first Sefer, provided there is time to roll it before the end of Shvi’i (reading of Rosh Chodesh). Otherwise, it should be read from the second Sefer.
Practically:
In both cases, the Sifrei Torah should be prepared for the readings of Miketz and Rosh Chodesh.
In the first scenario:
After placing the second Sefer on the Bimah and performing Hagbah and Glilah on the first Sefer, the first Sefer should be rolled to the reading of Chanukah, making sure to complete it before the recital of Kaddish – when it should be placed next to the second Sefer Torah. Then, after Kaddish, Hagbah and Glilah are done on the second Sefer Torah and the Maftir is read from the first Sefer etc.
In the second scenario:
After Kaddish, no Hagbah and Glilah are done to the Sefer Torah. Rather, it is rolled straight to the reading of Chanukah.###question 
  Is photographing the Menorah candles in a dark room considered deriving use out of the candles? 
The Chanukah candles many times create a beautiful look on the menorah, especially if the room is rather dark, the candles “light up” the menorah.
Is photographing the menorah while the candles are lit and the room is dark a problem of deriving use out of the candles?
If this is a problem, can it be done after they’ve burned for 50 minutes? Or be put out after the 50 minutes and then relit?.
 ###answer 
 
It is not a problem.
However, it is advisable at all times to have another burning candle or light besides for the Shamash to ensure that one does not benefit from the candles nor from the Shamash.
It’s certainly preferable if it’s done after it has burned the requisite amount. (It should be pointed out that common custom is not to have benefit from the candles even after the time. As above, photography is permitted).
It would not be permissible to put them out after the 50 minutes and then relight them. Strictly speaking, one may extinguish the candles then, though some are stringent. However, in this case, this would be absolutely forbidden as one is benefiting from the remaining oil for their own use.###question 
 My question is: What is considered 6 as tefila btzibur? Do they need to all begin exactly the same time? What if 5 are in the middle of amida and didn’t conclude yet and the 6th guy begins. Where is the cut-off?
Bideieved..if 5 people were halfway through (or further) and the 6th joined…is that tefila btzibur and does the chazan do a full chazaras hashatz in such a situation?.
 ###answer 
 
In all these cases, Chazoras Hashatz is done.
As for the definition of Tefillah Betzibur, preferably, all six should start Shmoneh Esrei together. However, even if they all daven part of Shmoneh Esrei at the same time,  it is considered Tefilah Betzibur, according to some, or even if they start in middle of chazas Hashatz.###question

  Is it my obligation to inform the Shul’s management that this act is prohibited?
I passed by my Shul’s Mikvah this past Friday night after davening, and I noticed that there was a steady stream of dryer exhaust/steam coming out of its windows. It was clear that a clothes dryer was in use. This happened two hours after sunset, which means that the Goyim clearly started the cycle on Shabbos.
While I know that if a Goy is paid a lump sum to do something every day, including Shabbos (Bihavla’ah), and there is no enjoyment immediately being derived from his actions, then that is fine, however – shouldn’t this case be judged as an act of “Meleches Goy Bifarhesia” which is prohibited due to Maris Ayin?
And if so, is it my obligation to inform the Shul’s management that this act is prohibited?.

  May a mother hold, kiss, gaze at, or take a picture of her stillborn?.
 ###answer 
 None of the above should be done. While looking momentarily is not a problem, one should not gaze intently at the deceased.
Rabbi Yehuda Hachasid writes that parents should not kiss their child who passed way and that this could be quite dangerous. Many poskim extend this to anyone kissing the dead. Furthermore, many poskim mention also not to hold the child.
In the case where this might be deemed therapeutic for the mother, a Rav should be consulted to determine whether it would be acceptable. It should be noted that there are conflicting studies whether contact with the stillborn is deemed to be beneficial for the mother or the reverse.###question

 We would like to invite a family for the Shabbos day meal. However, they have a 15-year-old son and 2 daughters ages 11 and 8. We have a 13 y.o. son and a 14 y.o. daughter. Would it be acceptable to host this family for the meal –are they boys/girls of the two families too close in age to be at the same table?.
 ###answer 
 
While technically it’s not forbidden to host single bachurim and girls at the same meal, this is considered inappropriate. One should go to great lengths to arrange their hosting of meals in such a way that bachurim and girls aren’t invited at the same time. Rumor has it that the Rebbe instructed that Yeshivos not allow bachurim to eat out at families who have girls home, even if they are little girls.
The general age for when to separate kids is when they start maturing to understand the concept of separation between men and women. This is generally between the ages of 6 and 9. Children of 9 years and older, must be educated not to mingle and should be seated separately.
Where circumstances require such an arrangement, they should be seated at different tables.

  Is it a problem to Daven Mincha on Shabbos before Kiddush?.
 ###answer 
 No.###question 
  Is it permitted to benefit from the light on Shabbos if someone turned it on by mistake?
If someone turned on the light on Shabbos by mistake (either by bumping into the switch, or they forgot it was Shabbos) is it permitted to benefit from the light?
And what would be considered benefitting? (Would it make a difference if there was already some light before? Or if they need the light…?).
 ###answer 
 
It depends. If someone forgot that it was Shabbos, he and others may not benefit from the lights until after Shabbos. If however, he bumped into the light then it is permitted to benefit.
The definition of forbidden benefit is to do things using the light which otherwise wouldn’t be possible. If this isn’t your home, it is best to leave the house###question 
  Can we use a bottle of wine that someone brought on Friday night by car?
If someone not-yet-frum brought wine or other food on Friday night by car, may it be used that night for the meal? especially because he may get offended if I don’t use it during the meal. I’m a shliach and this happens very often..
 ###answer 
 
It may not be used till after Shabbos if there is no eiruv in town, or it was brought from out of the techum. Even if there is an eiruv and it’s within the techum, it would only be permitted if it was brought from a close place where he could’ve brought it by foot.
Furthermore, even where none of these apply, one should take into account the potential chilul Hashem, since it causes the issue of Shmiras Shabbos to be treated lightly. Another point to consider is that by not using the food it might cause them not to do so in the future. Where none of these concerns apply, one may use the food, and indeed it would be appropriate to do so in order not to offend them.
There is no issue of muktzah.

  Is there a problem with wearing a Mezuzah necklace? If not, can it be used on Shabbos in a place without an Eiruv?.
 ###answer 
 Permitted. However, you must ensure to remove it before entering a bathroom or any other unclean place. It may also not be worn or be in the room during intimate relations.
It may not be worn on Shabbos in a place without an Eiruv. One should not wear it at all on Shabbos because one might forget to remove it before going out of the home.###question 
 I have been practicing shechita at a halal place and many Muslims wear something that looks like a yarmulke. I have learned that some clients thought I was Muslim and therefore allow me to shecht (it’s totally kosher for a Muslim to eat the shechita of a Jew, but some prefer a Muslim do it, because it’s more “mehudar” in their eyes. Much of the halal meat sold on the market today are treifos from cows shechted by Jews, with a Muslim standing nearby saying his prayer before the shechita). Being that this is the case should I mention to anyone who comes that I am not Muslim, and if I don’t mention this, is that considered genevas daas?
I am doing this for free and the owners are very kind about the fact that in order to be a shochet you need practice, but the customers have no idea that I am doing it. Many customers aren’t halal but just like the poultry and beef/lambs that the halal place owns and raises. Those who want a Muslim to slaughter it come to the back of the production where the slaughter takes place to ensure that a Muslim does it or that they do it themselves. One detail which may or may not make a difference is that the halal place owns the animal but then sells the meat thats been prepared in a halal way to the customers..

  Can I print Matzah covers with the Brochos on them?

 ###answer 
 It is only allowed If:
The workers would not place the garbage into the compactor or take out the garbage to the street (in a place where there is no eruv) on Shabbos.
The garbage doesn’t fall into the compactor which will be activated when the garbage falls into it.

 Does this apply to just food or also all Shabbos needs?
For example, I want to buy my wife a Leichter. Can I rely on this to spend as much as I can afford for it to be the most beautiful possible?
Is the fact that I’m buying it to make my wife happy take away from buying it Likovod Shabbos?.
 ###answer 
 
It applies not only to  food but all shabbos needs, provided the individual’s intention is for kavod Shabbos and he has trust in Hashem that he will repay.
However, this applies only if it’s based on the persons current financial level and his regular spending habits. It  does not apply if one will have to borrow money for this unless he has objects he can use as a collateral.

  If I’m reading Megillah and a nearby Minyan is saying Kedusha, what should I do?.
 ###answer 
 Q. Can one be yotze Megillah if there are other minyanim and they are saying Kedusha etc.?
A. If you make sure to hear every single word, though it could be quite difficult and this setup is not recommended.
Q. So does that mean that if I do hear a Kaddish or something else I need not answer it?
A. The halachos for answering are the same as during birchos krias shema, i.e. you should only answer    ,  ,   , etc.
This applies only if you are reading the megillah.
If you’re hearing the megillah and the reader is not stopping you shouldn’t stop to answer, unless you have a kosher megillah where you can catch up afterwards and read what you missed while answering and it won’t disturb you from listening properly.###question

  Does oat flour need to be kosher in general? Does Chabad eat Matzah made out of oats?.
 ###answer 
 Kashrus:
Oat flour is inherently kosher and requires no hechsher for year-round use (not for Pesach), if there are no added kosher sensitive ingredients.
Obviously, one must ensure the flour isn’t infested. If one is particular about chodosh, you would need to check the date code.
Matzah:
There are serious shaalos with oat matzoh since they are treated with heat in order to store them. There are available oat matzos that are not treated with heat. These should be used when necessary. Even so, wheat matzah is always preferred.

  Can one make Shehecheyanu on Vegetables?
Is it a rule that we do not make a  on vegetables (for example a fresh tomato)?
If yes what is the  of vegetables in this context? (is it the same things which would make it ץ or ?).
 ###answer 
 
Such a rule does exist, but this is not the opinion of the Alter Rebbe and therefore not accepted Chabad practice.
There is however a halacha which excludes many vegetables from Birkas Shehechiyanu: we don’t make the Brocho on any fruit or vegetable which can be stored from season to season.###question 
  Are we ever  to make the Bracha of   ? If yes – when?.
 ###answer 
 The common custom is not to make this Brocha nowadays. If one lives in the area where there are no Shules around and he hasn’t seen a Shule in 30 days, he should make this Brocha when seeing a beautiful active Shule, if the Jewish community there is living in relative tranquility.###question 
  If fish and meat were mistakenly cooked together, are the Keilim OK?.

  How do security cameras affect Yichud? Do they?
For example, if multiple people have access say to a Chabad House or office, but there is a male alone inside with a female, even though anyone can walk in at any time (so it isn’t considered Yichud) there will be advance warning as the person entering will be seen on the video screen when they are outside. Does that change the situation?.

In such a case, the fact that multiple people have access won’t help.###question 
 The problem is that we need to move there already this time next year since we are not able to afford to pay rent and mortgage at the same time and we cant start building until September. Any way around this?.
 ###answer 
 
All of this applies only if there was no building whatsoever in the entire area, even a small building.
If there was indeed no building, including a structure for the construction crew, the rule is as follows:
Regarding the area of the Shul, it is not an issue.
For the residential areas, if it’s for a home for a teacher or any other communal worker, it is not an issue. There’s also room for leniency if being bought by a young couple right after marriage.
If they’re being rented out and the owner is not the one living there, it’s not an issue either.
If the owner himself is living on the property, he should build a sukkah there first and afterwards it’s not a problem. Also, a proper Chanukas Habayis should be done to consecrate the home for Torah and Davening.
Another option is to make an independent “sale” of the home to someone else for the first year, and then one may live there immediately thereafter. (Alternatively, if you already own it prior to it being finished, you can sell it right then and there, and only when it’s complete will you re-purchase it).
Regardless, you should receive approval of three Rabbonim to go ahead with either of these leniencies.
The 12 months wait does not begin when the entire building was completed; it begins from when the building was above the height of the windows.###question 
  Can I mention the name of a non-Jew in the Bracha of Refaeiynu in the Shmonah Esrei?
I have long lists of names of people who need healing that I insert in my prayers when I have the time. I have divided them into those who are Jewish and those who are not. Some people have told me that they don’t think I can include the non-Jews’ names in this tefillah (I realize the section ends with roifei choiley amoi yisrael.) Is it ok that I mention the names of goyim here? And if not, where can I do so?.
 ###answer 
 
Depends.
If you’re davening for someone because it affects you directly, such as a co-worker, cleaning help etc., you may daven for this in the bracha of Shema Koleinu, as for other needs.
If you’re davening for them as a mentchlich and peaceful gesture it should be done outside of Shemone Esrai.
Regarding davening for non Jews, see also:

  Can we have an Early Dinner on the Second Night of Yom Tov?
On second night of Yom Tov this year, candle lighting is after 9 pm. Can we drink wine with our guests at dinner earlier and then do kiddush after 9?
I was told that may not eat or drink from sunset till kiddush is made. So us much older folk must wait to eat dinner at 9:15?.
 ###answer 
 
Although this is not the custom, there is room to be lenient if necessary, such as in this case, and daven Maariv as well as make kiddush earlier, from plag hamincha (check the exact time in local calendars etc.) onwards, similar to what is done when accepting Early Shabbos.
Nonetheless, candle lighting may not be done until nightfall, as one may not prepare from one day Yom Tov to the next.
Alternatively, one can begin eating dinner without washing prior to sunset, then break till nightfall (as one may not eat without kiddush from sunset onwards), then daven Maariv at nightfall, followed by candle lighting, kiddush, washing etc. This way, one will not deviate from the established custom.
Remember not to prepare from one day Yom Tov till the next, until nightfall.###question 
  1. Is sending someone a Bracha as a WhatsApp message the same as giving it in person? 2. What’s the Inyan of placing ones hands over someone’s head when giving them a Bracha?.
 ###answer 
 If so, should the person say/respond with amen?
Answers:
1.
A bracha can be given in writing or verbally. Each one has its own special power.
One should respond “Amen” in writing.
2.
Regarding placing the hands over one’s head while blessing them – Some do this. Some don’t. Some use only right hand.
The reasons of this custom:
To make the recipient a vessel for the bracha; to unite the one blessing and the recipient; to indicate extra flow of blessing, ayin yafeh; because there are 15 joints in the hand corresponding to the 15 words of Birchas kohanim.

  Can a child say Kaddish alone?
If a child under bar mitzvah is saying Kaddish and is the only one, does someone else, like the Chazan, need to also be saying it with them?
Is there any difference between Kaddish d’rabbanan, which the minyan would always say, and Kaddish Yasom?.
 ###answer 
 
A katan may recite kaddish himself and there’s no need for someone to say with him. This applies to all kaddeishim which are not normally recited by the Chazan.###question 
 If one is by a river and the waters are quite dirty (there is a sign that says some sewage goes there). It is not clear if a dog would drink from the waters. If there is no nearby water, what is the recommended practice for washing netilas yadayim for bread?
I was told that for some rivers doing tevila with the hands is also a problem because these waters are used to create electricity and therefore are not even good for tevilas yadayim. What if someone is not sure if these waters have that problem?.
 ###answer 
 
If it’s possible to find out (you might be able to find out online etc.) that this river has no turbines and the like which render the river invalid for tevilah then you should toivel your hands in the river and say ‘Al shtifas yadayim‘.
If it does have turbines, and the water is actually so bad that a dog won’t drink even from the little bit of water which will be in the kvort, one may be lenient if there is no other water available within 4 ‘mil‘ ahead of him to wrap both of his hands in a napkin or cloth and eat the bread without washing.
However it’s worthwhile to note that the Alter Rebbe writes that the one who is stringent not to eat without washing is “  ”.
If as you mentioned there is a doubt about the status of the river and likewise it’s a doubt whether a dog will drink from this water or not, and there is no nearby water then the halachah is that you may use this water either to toivel your hands or to wash with this water from a kvort, and a brachah should be recited.###question 
  A Chiyuv needs an Aliya, the Gabbai calls up someone else. What can be done?
If there is a chiyuv which is supposed to get an aliyah, and the gabbaicalled up somebody else by mistake (for the last aliyah) can the chiyuv still be called up instead as long as the oleh didn’t say Hashem’s name in the bracha yet, or is it too late once the first name is called?.
 ###answer 
 
If the individual who was called is a Kohen or Levi, he should get the Aliya. Even if it’s a Yisroel, unless the chiyuv was already promised, the one who was called should go up.
However, if the one who was called up is prepared for shalom reasons to pardon his Aliya, the chiyuv may be oleh.###question 
  Is one allowed to smoke a cigarette or a vape on a fast day?.

  Can I get an Aliya during a Kriah in which the Baal Koreh mispronounced a word which changed the meaning of the word?
Am I allowed to get an aliya during a krias hatorah in which the baal koreh mispronounced a word or several words which changed the meaning of the word, or is the whole kriah invalid and I can even walk out during this kriah? The concern is bracha levatala.
The baal koreh read some aliyos and now they want to give me an aliya. Technically, during my aliya I can read along quietly and make sure I pronounce all the words correctly.
Also, does it make a difference if it’s a regular aliya or maftir?.
 ###answer 
 
Lchatchillah those pesukim should be read again. If this hasn’t happened, you may not walk out.
If you’re called to an Aliya, you should accept and make the appropriate brachos, and ensure you read properly quietly.
The same answer applies to maftir.###question 
  I was hired to read the Torah In a shul on Shabbos. When I came there was no Minyan. Do they still have to pay me?.
 ###answer 
 Introduction:
One may not accept Schar Shabbos (payment for work done on Shabbos).
One way of being permitted to accept payment for Laining is to be paid for the preparation rather than for the act itself; since the preparation is done during the week it is permissible to be paid for it and the work done on Shabbos would be considered as being done “pro bono.”
See also:
Article: Payment for Work Done on Shabbos
To answer your question:
Yes, the amount agreed upon for preparation (otherwise, you may not accept payment for the work done on Shabbos, although there is room for leniency due to it being a mitzvah).
More importantly, as a general rule: when hired for a job, one gets paid if they were prepared to do the work, even if they didn’t achieve the purpose, if it was due to factors beyond their control, where the employer might have been able to find out the conditions at the workplace.###question

Yes, if there’ll be a Minyan present, See also here.
The Kaddish to be said is a regular Kaddish Derabanan – see here and here.
If there will be someone with a Chiuv present, the custom is that they say the Kaddish. Otherwise, the one who makes the Siyum says it. If he is a minor before his Bar Mitzvah, an adult should say it (although a minor may technically say Kaddish as done by yesomim. See here).###question 
 If someone had apples in a Ziploc bag and went into the Ohel with them, may the apples be eaten?.

Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew.
Madagascar Vanilla Almond.
Honey Roasted Nuts & Sea Salt.
Salted caramel dark chocolate nut.
Maple Glazed Pecan & Sea Salt.
Blueberry Vanilla Cashew.
P.S. This question relates only to the correct bracha; the kashrus of any product is dependent on the hechsher, obviously.

  ###question 
  Is “split” chicken a Hidur?
Someone was writing this on WhatsApp.
“According to Rabbi Braun split it’s not a hidur now days – and leads to a lot of problems with getting salt under the skin…. (I heard this from someone who spoke with him – not directly from him)”
Is this the opinion of the rav or was the rav misquoted?.
 ###answer 
 
It is true that the original reasons for splitting chickens hardly apply nowadays in many modern facilities. The key reasons for splitting the chickens are:
to make sure that the salt goes all the way in, and 
to make sure that the lungs, heart spleen and kidneys are not there anymore.
Due to technological advances the way salt is applied today this hardly is an issue, as the entire chicken is covered from salt inside and outside. Likewise our cleaning system is such that in most cases all these organs removed anyhow.
Arguably, there might even be a reason not to split, since when splitting the skin separates from the flesh and there would need to be supervision to ensure that salt is applied also between the skin and the flesh.
Nonetheless, there are many who wish to continue this hiddur nowadays too.###question 
  Can my wife hum or whistle while she is Nidah in my presence?.

 I suffer from dry eyes and almost every day I put in eye drops one to four times to alleviate the dryness. Can I do so on Yom Kippur if necessary?.
 ###answer 
 
Yes, if it’s an over the counter type (like artificial tears). If it’s a sharp pain regardless it’s allowed.###question 
  Can I eat in a Sukka under an umbrella?.
 ###answer 
 No.###question 
 B”h my wife is due around yom tov. Her doctor is based out of a hospital in Staten Island. Can we go there from Crown Heights on Shabbos/Yom tov even though we cross a bridge (techum) or is it necessary to go to a hospital in Brooklyn where we don’t know which doctor will be assigned by the hospital?
If yes, can whoever accompanies her travel back to CH after the birth (this is especially necessary if birth occurs on the first day of Yom tov or Friday night as it would be difficult to have someone or even accompany her myself if we can’t return)..
 ###answer 
 
She may go to her hospital when she has a doctor which she knows. She should only take along necessary things. It is advisable to make all her items – and items of whoever is accompanying her –  Hefker to mitigate the issue.
Whoever is accompanying her may not return home.###question 
  Is pronouncing ץ  problematic as it sounds like Hashem’s name?
Would it be considered pronouncing Hashem’s name (Yud-Kay) when pronouncing a yud with the vowel patach or Kamatz being that they have the same pronunciation?
Can I read those letters from the siddur and also instruct students when teaching them how to pronounce yud with the nikud patach or Kamats even though it will sound like Hashem’s name is being said?.
 ###answer 
 
It may be pronounced regularly.###question 
 My friend has an elderly and frail mother. She wakes up early on Shabbos morning and davens almost right away. It’s hard for her to make kiddush, so she asked her son to make for her. At that time he is still before davening, but he doesn’t want to keep her waiting. Can he make kiddush and be motzi her before davening? (Obviously he’ll make kiddush again for himself after davening).
Similarly, sometimes on Friday night he didn’t daven kabolasShabbos/maariv yet but doesn’t want to keep her waiting. Is it a problem to make kiddush Friday night before davening?.
 ###answer 
 
He may in both cases.
Alternatively, she may make Kiddush on (grape juice, preferably, or on) coffee/tea.###question 
  Someone in the process of converting used my oven. Does it need to be Kashered?
I have a question about the kashrus status of a kitchen (stove, oven, counters etc.) and utensils (pots, plates, cutlery).
There is someone subletting my apartment as I am abroad now, and I recently found out that she is in the process of converting, so currently, she isn’t Jewish.
She has told me that she is Shomer Shabbos and kashrus.
She has been using the kitchen as normal, I.e. using our stove/oven, and pots, plates etc.
Is this OK? Or do we need to kasher everything in order to be able to use it again?.
 ###answer 
 
The oven and all utensils must be Kashered.

Q. Regarding the oven, would it be enough to clean it very well, and then turn it on the highest temperature for 50 minutes?
A. Yes.###question 
  Does this seltzer machine need Tevilah?
This seltzer machine (see attached pic) works by filling up a bottle of water, then you put the bottle under the metal stick (blue arrow in picture pointing to it) – which then shoots the bubbles into the water.
Sothewater itself does not go through the machine, the only contact between the water and the machine is that you insert the metal piece into the bottle of water (and it touches the water)..
 ###answer 
 
Best to have a yid take it apart. If impossible there is room to exempt from tevilah.###question

 I work for a moisad helping them get reimbursements/payments from the government for help they provide for eligible children. I made a mistake and did not submit the claim for the full amount. Now it is too late to ask for that money. Am I responsible to inform the moisad about the mistake and pay for the missing money they could have gotten if not for my mistake?.
 ###answer 
 
There is a Machlokes whether you are responsible or not, therefore there is no way we can tell you that you have to pay. Either way, you would not have to tell them. It is debatable whether you would have to pay   . In this case, there are strong arguments to rely on not to.###question 
  Can I teach my class during Shiva, after the third day?
Hi, I’m in on the second day of Shiva for my brother. I am a eighth grade teacher, and the class will probably not end up with a proper substitute. Is there a heter to start teaching after 3 days if there is no one else? I saw something along those lines in the kitzur shulchan aruch….
 ###answer 
 
The common custom is not to do so, but rather use a substitute.###question 
  There is a Bar Mitzvah boy and 11 years old girl, who should make Hafroshas Challah then?.
 ###answer 
 The bar mitzvah boy.
If the girl did do it, it is certainly kosher after the fact.
Nonetheless, if the dough doesn’t belong to her, some opinions maintain it wouldn’t be kosher after the fact either, as a minor cannot become a Shaliach. If however the owner gives her the dough as gift, she is considered the owner and it would certainly be valid. However, she wouldn’t then be able to ask someone else to do it on her behalf according to all opinions.###question 
  Do people who don’t want to join a Minyan count as part on the ten?
Sometimes in the airports in NYC, I try to assemble a minyan while waiting for a flight and I cannot always find 10 willing to daven.
If we have at least 6 (but less than 10) men who want to daven Maariv, and there are enough Yidden in the room amongst a crowd of hundreds waiting for the flight to complete the minyan, may we daven Maariv with kaddish and barchu? (Even if the others don’t wish to participate in the minyan? Even if they aren’t yet Torah observant and don’t understand Hebrew? Even if they are sitting on chairs in a mixed crowd with women and we are in the same view of them many feet away in the corner of the same room?)
If its Shachris/Mincha may the group of 6-9 recite kaddish/barchu and daven shemone esrei together? And should we then skip chazaras hashatz since we can’t get 9 willing to answer? If that still considered tefila btzibur?.
 ###answer 
 
If six people are davening together and there are ten Jewish men in the room, whether they are aware of it or not, and even if they oppose the minyan, as long as they believe in Hashem and the mitzvah of tefilla, it is considered tefilla b’tzibur. Thus, you may daven Maariv and recite Kadish. For Shacharis and Mincha, you need nine people to answer Chazaras Hashatz.
If they are mechalel Shabbos b’farhesya, there is justification for those lenient to include them in the Minyan, being that they are tinokos shenishbu, although, some are stringent and would not count them in the minyan.
The above is providing that there are no non-tznius people in sight. See here for more information:
Is it permitted to Daven in a public place if there are women there?

  Can I do Birkas Kohanim if I have negative feelings towards someone?
If a kohen has negative feelings towards one person or a group of people in shul, is he allowed to do Birkas Kohanim? What should he do in such a situation?.
 ###answer 
 
Yes. If there is indeed hatred chas v’sholom, he should do everything he can to uproot the hatred and instill within himself true Ahavas Yisroel.
If he hasn’t managed to uproot the hatred at least for the time of duchaning, he must leave the shule before Retzei.
The concern is only if there is hatred, not if there are negative feelings. Even so, he should initially make sure that he has no negative feelings.
This only applies if he has these feelings towards the community at large, or most of them, not to a couple of individuals.###question

  Is the Alter Rebbes Siddur the real Nusach Ari? – Part II
How does the Rav explain the clear contradictions between Shaar Hakavanot and the Alter Rebbe’s Siddur?

 Is it ok to play a recording of someone singing this Niggun during the play, if no one will be singing it live? (The “Alter Rebbe” character will be lip-syncing, pretending to be singing it live).
And would it be ok for people to watch a video of the play that has this Niggun?.
 ###answer 
 
You should use a different niggun for your play.
P.S. In all the traditional sources there’s no reference that this was the daled bavos niggun, just a dveikus niggun, named since then as the Matan Torah niggun. I don’t think that anyone knows today which Niggun that title refers to.
For another tradition about a niggun sung at Matan Torah, see here page 8.###question 
 My question is, how does this affect my davening, wearing tefillin, making brachos, etc.?
In practice, I empty my ostomy pouch before going to shul in the morning, although there is always some residue clinging to the inside. (That is inevitable.) I put on tefillin and begin davening, but I find that the pouch begins filling up again before I am finished. Of course, it is worn under my clothing, so it isn’t visible, but I can feel it. What should I do?.
 ###answer 
 
You may put on Tefillin and daven while the pouch is covered. You don’t need to stop when it fills up.###question 
  Does scratching the Eyebrow require washing hands as in scratching the scalp?.

  Would it be ok if I use my pool to go to Mikvah?
I don’t feel comfortable going to mikvah anymore, the one I have near me is small and the women make me feel exposed and uncomfortable and everyone waits in the same waiting room together. I’ve found myself not wanting to go anymore.
Would it be ok if I use my pool to go to mikvah and prepare at home?.
 ###answer 
 
A pool is not a mikvah, and does not work to achieve Tahara. One who immersed in a pool is considered a full-fledged niddah in all respects, and having relations in such a situation incurs kares, Heaven forbid.
You most certainly may do – and should do -the preparations at home. However, the tevilah must be done in a properly constituted Mikva.
With that being said, it might be worth it to explore mikvaos in neighboring communities provided they have a good hashgocha. Alternatively, you may wish to consider having a discussion with the management of the mikvah, to see if they can arrange private scheduling for you at a later time where you won’t have this issue. You might need to reimburse them with extra pay for working outside normal hours.###question 
 Am I yotzei these foods with the Ha’adama bracha I made? Or do I now need to say Ha’eitz?.
 ###answer 
 
In some cases, the correct bracha would be ha’adama regardless of the ha’etz food in the mixture, for example if it’s the primary ingredient in the mixture . See details here:
Bracha on Salad Mixture
In a case where one is required to make a separate ha’etz – he does not fulfill his obligation by making only ha’adama in error. Nonetheless, it’s best one should find another fruit which is not part of the mixture in order to make on it ha’etz.###question

 ###answer 
 There’s room to be lenient, if it’s a small pistol, and they don’t wear it, rather they hold it in their hand
As for going to a shooting range in general:
Halachically, it is permitted (provided it is done in a safe way, of course). However, one should certainly consider the impact it will have on the participants, from a Chinuch’s perspective (especially on children, and even more so with girls).###question

  Do wine bottles need to have the Hechsher printed on the cork?
I recently started importing wines with a very good hashgacho and almost all the bottles have the hechsher printed on the cork, but some of the bottles do not. I Inquired with the manufacturer, and they told me that due to supply chain and time constraints the hashgocho allowed them to use corks without the hechsher printed on them. In my daas baal habatim, this doesn’t sound right. It sounds like delivering food without a seal or something. Please let me know what the Rov thinks about his situation. Thank you..
 ###answer 
 
If the corks are fastened in the wine bottles in a way that if opened by someone it would be very hard or impossible to put it back to look as it was (as in most cases with wine bottles), then it would be considered a seal even if there is no Hashgacha printed on it.
Even if not, there is a debate amongst the poskim if wine nowadays needs two seals (like it says in Shulchan Aruch) or one seal would be enough.
Thus, if the wine is Mevushal then the cork is sufficient according to all. If it is not Mevushal, then according to some opinions there should be a second seal, for example (like a lot of wines have) a piece of plastic that covers the cap/cork and top of bottle tight in a way that once opened it can’t be returned.
(Even even if it only has a cork, if the company’s name is printed on it, one may rely on the lenient poskim when the company only produces kosher wine. However, a company that produces non-kosher wine but also has a kosher run, would need to have the actual hashgocho printed on it.)
In any case, after the fact one may rely on the lenient poskim who hold that one seal is sufficient.###question 
  Does Challah needed to separated from Lekach/honey cake?.
 ###answer 
 According to the Tzemach Tzedek (YD 236) If the dough is mostly honey, it is exempt from the Mitzvah of Challah.
If it is a very sweet dough (but not the majority), there is room to justify the lenient opinions not to take Challah. Certainly, a Bracha should not be said.###question 
  What is the Minhag about the hair cut by the Upshernish?.
 ###answer 
 No it need not be preserved.
One should not burn the hair unless adding something to it.
One should not throw in a place where people will step on it, rather bury it or throw in the garbage.
Some would weigh the hairs and give an equivalent amount of coins to charity.###question 
 If there is a speech before Musaf, after the Torah was returned to the Aron, should the Chazan for Musaf finish Ashrei again out loud before reciting Kaddish? If yes, does he need to say the whole Ashrei again or just the last few Pesukim?.
 ###answer 
 
If the drasha is – and concludes with – Torah, no need.
When there are other matters or announcements, best to recite a complete chapter of Tehillim and say the last pesukim out loud.###question 
  I have a Chabad House. The step-up would be more convenient if we faced north. Can I put the Aron Kodesh on the north side and face there?.
 ###answer 
 The Aron Kodesh should be placed on the side facing Eretz Yisroel even if this will cause inconvenience.
Where if it is totally impossible to place the Aron Kodesh facing Eretz Yisroel there are authorities who permit placing it in a different direction.
If for what ever reason it was placed in a different direction, nevertheless the congregation still faces Eretz Yisroel and not the Aron Kodesh.###question 
  Can I switch my drink with a friends cold drink?

And what about in a case that I know for sure that he won’t use the one I just put in before it gets cold, for example if he has many cans in the fridge?.

 Also I know the Torah doesn’t accept 2 men as a marriage, so what’s the difference between a couple who can’t conceive and a gay couple?.
 ###answer 
 
The distinction is rooted in the traditional understanding of the purpose of sexual relations within marriage. According to Torah, procreation is considered one of the primary purposes of sexual intimacy. While a heterosexual couple unable to conceive naturally can still engage in sexual relations to strengthen their bond, they are seen as engaging in an act with the potential for procreation, even if it does not result in pregnancy. (This also explains why even for a heterosexual couple there are still laws that prohibit certain types of sexual intimacy).
Additionally, every time there is relations within marriage it creates Neshamos above and brings sanctity into this world. Indeed, we are taught that the souls of converts emanate from such relations. Likewise, these souls will eventually descend into bodies in the days of Moshiach. This can be compared to planting, where the harvesting takes place later, in higher worlds or even down here below.
In the case of a same-gender couple, their sexual relations are considered as deviating from the natural design for procreation. Indeed, sexual acts outside the context of heterosexual marriage are associated with transgressions. This can be compared to spilling seed without any planting whatsoever.
It is also important to note that Jewish teachings emphasize the complementarity of male and female in the context of marriage. This perspective highlights the belief that the coming together of male and female is seen as a necessary element in fulfilling the divine purpose of creation and the continuation of the human family, as well as causing the unity of masculine and feminine forces in the universe.###question 
  I asked someone if he wants to put on , he said yes but only if the other  in his office do so as well. Can I do that?.
 ###answer 
 It is a Bizayon to the Tefillin. Therefore, you should do whatever you can to make sure that they would not put on the Tefillin. However, you should put on the Tefillin with the yid even if, as a result, the Goyim would put it on as well. You should avoid doing so yourself, putting on the goyim.###question

  Is there a problem davening on raised bleachers?
Is there a problem davening on raised bleachers (for example in 770 when there are big crowds and sometimes bochurim are standing on narrow benches that are raised) because of the fact that it is elevated and the fact that it is dangerous and one might not be able to focus because he is afraid that he might fall?.
 ###answer 
 
If they’re made in a solid way that there’s no fear of falling and there’s an area of 4×4 Amos (or the same overall size as 4×4, an area of about thirty-six square feet, even with different dimensions), one may daven there.
Also, if it is surrounded by at least 2 mechitzos which are each 10 tefachim high, there is room to permit to daven there. Preferably, there should be at least 3 mechitzos, as it is usually (two sides and back).
Likewise, if due to the set-up of the Shul and the large crowd it is a necessity to set things up this way, one may daven so, provided there is no fear of falling.###question 
  Does my neighbor have to pay for trimming his tree which is invalidating my Sukkah?
My neighbors tree branches are growing in such a way that they are over the area of my Sukkah. Who is responsible for paying for the trimming of the branches, my neighbor or me?.
 ###answer 
 
You may trim them. (You should find out if this is legal). It is your responsibility to pay for it. If, however, it was illegal for him to plant a tree there or if legally it is his responsibility to trim it, we follow the law. Likewise, if his tree is causing harm to the public, according to many authorities, it would be his responsibility to trim.###question

 I had a big surgery leaving me without a number of organs; my pelvis is empty as far as I know. Someone said that because my urine now flows directly from the ureter (from the kidneys) into a urostomy bag, leaving me without control over urinating, I cannot make an Asher Yotzar, except as part of the morning brochos. But here’s my question: I also have a colostomy bag in which collects my stool, which I also cannot control. But sometimes when I take the bag off to put on a fresh one, more stool comes out and I can tell once the movement is completely finished. So why can’t I make the brocha for that, even though my urine might still be flowing?.
 ###answer 
 
Only in the morning, as one makes a bracha only if it comes through the regular channels.###question

 Am I allowed to order a package from Amazon that says that it will be delivered on Shabbos (they don’t give an estimate of 3-5 days, rather, Amazon says the specific day when it will arrive. Also, Amazon does not usually use a 3rd party to deliver, they have their own delivery system)?
Also, is Amazon prime allowed if the package will arrive on Sunday/Monday? Am I allowed to order a package that most likely will require them to work on Shabbos (eg: if I order on Thursday and the arrival is on Sunday)?
My question is that today the shipping has become very precise (especially with Amazon), they always deliver on the day they said they would. Therefore, does this mean that any package that will arrive on Shabbos is not allowed to be ordered even if it’s ordered on Monday?
Also, it seems that the company is very busy every day preparing your package to arrive on time, so therefore, even if I make an order on Tuesday and it will arrive on Sunday, is that allowed (since it’s almost certain that they will do work on Shabbos)?.
 ###answer 
 
Amazon gives 3 shipping options:
Prime – one day: This is usually not allowed if the package will be delivered Shabbos. Amazon prime is allowed however if the package will arrive on Sunday/Monday. If you order on Friday close to Shabbos, you should avoid Sunday delivery as well.
Regular delivery: Always allowed, even if the delivery date is Shabbos.
Schedule your delivery date: Cannot be scheduled for Shabbos.

  What are the guidelines that would make a concert “kosher”?
My children like music. They express interest in attending concerts. I only feel comfortable if there is no mixed seating. Even if there isn’t mixed seating, something about it just doesn’t sit right.
I was recently at a concert for the first time. There was an option for separate seating, which we chose. Women were singing along all together out loud, some were dancing. There was no mechitza. I did not feel comfortable with it. But maybe there is a heter for this as the room is dark, and its many girls singing together?… and maybe according to the basic halacha it is ok? and just if you want to be extra stringent it’s a problem?
Am I being overly machmir with my sense of discomfort?
It seems every day there is another concert popping up somewhere and it would be helpful for me to know what Halacha say about this, in case an opportunity arises again in the future.
What are the guidelines that would make a concert “kosher”?.
 ###answer 
 
Please see here:
Are men and women allowed to sit together? (At a concert, event, etc.) 
Specifically, regarding concerts, note the following answers from the Rebbe:
1.
In 5748, HASC planned its first “A Time for Music” benefit concert and invited MBD to perform. He agreed on condition that the performance will have separate seating across the whole hall, but the organizers were worried that such an arrangement will cause many people to avoid the concert. MBD offered to go with them to “Sunday Dollars” by the Rebbe and ask the Rebbe for a blessing, asking that the concert be successful despite the separate seating.
The next Sunday the HASC organizers arrived in 770 together with MBD, and after MBD introduced them to the Rebbe he mentioned that they agreed to make the concert with separate seating, and they want a blessing for success. The Rebbe gave them a blessing and the preparations for the concert began.
A few days before the concert was due to take place the organizers were worried, very few tickets were sold, and people said it was because of the separate seating. One of the organizers came up with an idea, to have mixed seating but call it “Family Seating,” thus skirting the Halachic requirement for separate seating. But MBD was steadfast in his refusal and asked the organizers to write to the Rebbe about the problems and their idea. The Rebbe replied:
 ”     ,

If one has a winter coat that consists of an exterior and a removable wool lining, may one attach the inner wool lining on Shabbos?

Does it matter whether or not the lining is attached and detached via a zipper vs hooks, buttons, snaps etc.?.

Best to do it before Shabbos.
If it wasn’t done before Shabbos, there is room to be lenient and do it during Shabbos, if it’s not the first time being done. This is provided it won’t stay there forever, but you plan on removing it when the weather changes.
If it is with hooks, snaps or buttons, it is permitted regardless, unless it is the first time.###question

  Does bread need to be properly sealed when delivered by a non-Jew?

  Allah akbar or YeHareg veAl Yaavor?
Shalom,
In one of the October 7th videos a Chamas terrorist is pushing a gun in an Israeli captive’s face and shouting “Say ‘allah akbar!’ “.
What should the captive have done?
Is it permitted in general to say “allah akbar”?
(Basically, the question is: is allah a reference to Hashem, or a foreign god?)
After the recent horrific events we all witnessed and experienced, it is very relevant to all of us to know if we are required to be moser nefesh in such a situation, when a Muslim terrorist chas veshalom is threatening our lives to proclaim ‘allah akbar‘ – is it simply the same as saying ‘Hashem HaGadol veHaGibor‘, or since the muslim’s intention is for us to denounce our faith we are required to refuse at the cost of our lives?.

  Nefilas Apayim: in whisper or out loud?
It seems like the custom of people is to whisper silently nefilas apayim – is this correct or should it be said in the same loudness as the rest of davening according to halacha and/or Chabad custom?.
 ###answer 
 
Should be said quietly.###question 
 Am I able to answer to ,   through the phone or live video?
If I’m davening with 770 live over the phone and they are saying Kaddish when I’m in middle of Birchos krias Shema, may I answer?.
 ###answer 
 
Yes, you may answer during birchos krias Shema. Nonetheless, it is better if you turn off the phone and avoid this issue.###question 
  If your using the bathroom very frequently do you say Asher Yatzer after each time?.
 ###answer 
 Yes.
If he forgot to recite the first time, he recites it only once later.
However, if one is taking a medication causing him to urinate frequently, is different, as he has intention of clearing his intestinal tract completely and does not divert his attention from this process until it is complete. Until that time, therefore, he should not recite the blessing Asher Yatzar.
Likewise, if one left the bathroom but has not diverted their attention to other matters, as he is still wishes to try again, he should not recite Asher Yatzar yet, until he finishes.###question 
  May I put a frozen bag of vegetables etc. on my body on Shabbos as it might melt from my body heat?
If the answer is yes, may I cool myself off with these packets of frozen milk knowing and benefiting from the fact that they will melt? If neither of these are acceptable,may I use a cold cloth placed in the freezer?.
 ###answer 
 
1) One may handle ice packs to cool off with, since only a small amount of water is melted, there is no intention of melting them and the melted water is going to waste. Melting ice is problematic when one actively melts it, or even when no action is taken if this his intention, for example if wants to melt it save the melted water – which is not applicable in this case.
However, frozen food items like meat and vegetables should not be used since they are muktzah.
2) Since you want to melt the milk, you should not purposely use it to cool off so as to proactively melt it.
3) Cold towels that are not wet and will not become squeezed is permissible to use.###question 
  Can I get a heter to be intimate with my husband during the day?
Hi, I am nine months pregnant and too tired most of the time to be intimate at night. Can I get a heter to be intimate with my husband during the day?.
 ###answer 
 
According to halacha, relations must be at night or even after break of dawn until it’s light enough where people can recognize each other (misheyakir), the time when one may put on tefillin, provided it’s dark. This affects also the mazal as well as the neshama of the child born from these relations.
Ideally, you should attempt to do the same, but where this proves very difficult, and particularly in your case of pregnancy where it’s not for the purpose of conception, there is room for leniency. However, you should ensure that the room is completely dark, or at least cover yourself completely with a blanket that no light enters. If possible, one should schedule relations for Shabbos day.###question 
  Were there pigs in Noah’s ark as illustrated in this children’s book?.
 ###answer 
 Yes.###question 
  I have many boys KAH. Is it proper to pray to Hashem to be blessed with a girl?.
 ###answer 
 Yes.###question 
  Does one need to ask a Rav before being induced? Is there any Halachic issue?.
 ###answer 
 
This matter is discussed in a number of Poskim. The general rule is that one may not induce or rush the onset of labor unless there are clear medical reasons to require it. Some of the reasons for this prohibition are because:
There is a level of risk inherent to childbirth, and one should therefore not hasten it even though it is bound to come.
The special assurance of protection Hashem provides at the time of childbirth does not necessarily apply to the same degree if the birth is hastened without a clear medical need.
The procedures and/or medicines involved in induction can themselves cause complications, and one should not take that risk needlessly.###question 
  Can one bring a Sefer Torah to their son who is Bar Mitzvah for Leining in their house without Minyan on Zoom with family? No Birchas Hatorah just Leining. Friday afternoon. Has been preparing..
 ###answer 
 One should not transfer the Sefer Torah out of it’s set place to bring to read it in a home.
There is no such an obligation to read the Torah on a Friday afternoon, similarly there is no need to do it with a Kosher Sefer Torah.
Certainly there can be other ways to share the simcha of the Bar Mitzvah boy’s simcha of joining to being obligated in the mitzvos.
