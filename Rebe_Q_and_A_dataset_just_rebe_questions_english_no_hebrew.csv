" May I put a frozen bag of vegetables etc. on my body on Shabbos as it might melt from my body heat?
If the answer is yes, may I cool myself off with these packets of frozen milk knowing and benefiting from the fact that they will melt? If neither of these are acceptable,may I use a cold cloth placed in the freezer?","
1) One may handle ice packs to cool off with, since only a small amount of water is melted, there is no intention of melting them and the melted water is going to waste. Melting ice is problematic when one actively melts it, or even when no action is taken if this his intention, for example if wants to melt it save the melted water – which is not applicable in this case.
However, frozen food items like meat and vegetables should not be used since they are muktzah.
2) Since you want to melt the milk, you should not purposely use it to cool off so as to proactively melt it.
3) Cold towels that are not wet and will not become squeezed is permissible to use.","###question

" Can I get a heter to be intimate with my husband during the day?
Hi, I am nine months pregnant and too tired most of the time to be intimate at night. Can I get a heter to be intimate with my husband during the day?","
According to halacha, relations must be at night or even after break of dawn until it’s light enough where people can recognize each other (misheyakir), the time when one may put on tefillin, provided it’s dark. This affects also the mazal as well as the neshama of the child born from these relations.
Ideally, you should attempt to do the same, but where this proves very difficult, and particularly in your case of pregnancy where it’s not for the purpose of conception, there is room for leniency. However, you should ensure that the room is completely dark, or at least cover yourself completely with a blanket that no light enters. If possible, one should schedule relations for Shabbos day.","###question

 Does one need to ask a Rav before being induced? Is there any Halachic issue?,"
This matter is discussed in a number of Poskim. The general rule is that one may not induce or rush the onset of labor unless there are clear medical reasons to require it. Some of the reasons for this prohibition are because:
There is a level of risk inherent to childbirth, and one should therefore not hasten it even though it is bound to come.
The special assurance of protection Hashem provides at the time of childbirth does not necessarily apply to the same degree if the birth is hastened without a clear medical need.
The procedures and/or medicines involved in induction can themselves cause complications, and one should not take that risk needlessly.","###question

 What are the Halachos of Yichud when using Uber? ,"Uber:
Almost all of the Halachos of driving a regular car apply to a taxi or Uber, i.e. one may travel when it is lit up and during the time when there are people in the street (on those streets), and the windows are not tinted in a way that someone can’t see into the car.( ם מום  ’  ” )
However, there are those that are Machmir and hold that wherever possible, one should not travel with a non-Jew or a ‘Parutz’ even by day  ( מ   ז ’ ). With an Uber there is more room for leniency, as there are governing laws of the company for drivers, with GPS monitoring.
Parutz:
There is a Machlokes in Poskim how to define a Parutz. One must be especially careful in this regard when exposed to Yichud on a regular basis, such as in a workplace.
It is clear that a person who is not particular with the Issur of Kriva L’arayos and does not keep the guidelines of Tznius, even if he otherwise a Shomer Torah U’mitzvos, is  certainly considered  a Parutz. For example, a man who has no inhibitions about embracing women or girls, one who regularly watches television, reads unsuitable material, frequents indecent chat rooms on the internet, or visits movie theaters is considered a Parutz. The mere exposure to immodesty affects their morality. See Toras HaYichud 3:2:4. Shevet Halevi Vol. 5:202:1.
A man whose business dealings are questionable might be considered a Parutz in relation to Yichud — see Nitei Gavriel Yichud 22:9.
Furthermore, the average non-observant Jew is to be considered a Parutz too. The Tzemach Tzedek E”H 39 rules, that the definition of Anashim Ksheirim is one who has a special Chezkas Kashrus, such as a Talmid Chacham, and the standard Chezkas Kashrus of all Klal Yisroel isn’t sufficient. It seems that it need not be Mamosh a Talmid Chacham; it could be a Yeshiva Bachur etc., but it is not enough that we are not aware of any Pritzus behavior. See also Nitei Gavriel Yichud 19:3,10.

Our son was born on 19 Iyar. This year Erev Shavuos is on Shabbos. When should we make the Upshernish – on Friday 4 of Sivan or Tuesday Isru Chag?,"
• Generally:
For a child whose birthday is from after Lag Baomer until Erev Shavuos, the Upshernish haircut should take place on Erev Shavuos. [When Erev Shavuos falls on Shabbos – on 4 Sivan (with the exception of someone whose birthday is on Erev Shavuos, in which case it should be postponed until after Shavuos)].

https://asktherav.com/13133-when-should-a-boy-start-wearing-kippa-and-tzitzis/
• However, regarding someone whose birthday is on 19 Iyar, a day after Lag Baomer:
There are instructions from the Rebbe to perform the haircut on Lag Baomer.
While in most places it appears that it should take place on Lag Baomer itself (during the day), a day before the child turns 3, others record that it should be done on the actual birthday, right after nightfall on the night after Lag Baomer.
See here the testimony of three people who were all instructed by the Rebbe to do it on Lag Baomer: R. SB Popak, R. YY Hecht and R. Refoel Hartman. In the case of R. Hecht, the Rebbe himself did the cutting. (This information has been independently verified by us). In the case of R. Hartman, we have the actual answer of the Rebbe.
Independent of the above, there is yet another directive presented regarding the Upshernish of Ari Halberstam hy”d (whose birthday is on 19 Iyar), of which there are pictures of the Rebbe cutting the hair. See in the Hebrew references below.
This account raises several questions. Regardless, I feel there is enough information to rely upon to do it on Lag Baomer (by day).","###question

There are several issues here:
The requirement of taking lulav. They need to close their fingers or even better lift it. At the very least, according to some opinions, holding it in such a way that it doesn’t fall is also considered taking.
The fact that two people are holding it together: If they hold in such a way that without your support it would not fall and you are just assisting, and reversely, without them holding it, it would fall, it is valid. Otherwise, they should hold it on their own.
There is an issue of kavanah, since the person is just holding it without being conscious of the fact that they are doing a mitzvah. This is only an issue on the first day. (See link below)
Likewise, it might not be considered a kinyan and therefore not theirs. This also is only an issue on the first day, and ideally one should be concerned about this on the second day too.","###question

 Is an oven with Cook-time or Stop-time Mode acceptable for Shabbos use?,"There are many ovens on the market, and it is impossible in this short space to investigate and address every single model. The best we can do is provide a summary of the many issues to look out for. It is important that you read through the manuals of any model you are considering for purchase, in order to determine whether, and to what degree, the issues outlined below apply.
Thermostat:
The main problem with using a oven on Shabbos is the thermostat, which is affected by opening or closing the oven while the oven is on. When the oven door is opened, the thermostat will detect the cold air that rushes in and will activate the heating element if it is off at that moment. It is forbidden to cause this to occur, even if all the food will be removed all at once before the oven door is re-closed. [If the oven door is re-closed with some of the food remaining inside, there may be additional concerns of Bishul on Shabbos, depending on the circumstances.]  The thermostat is not a concern for Yom Tov use, but there are additional problems with a oven on Yom Tov as detailed below.
If the oven is off, like after the cook-time or stop time has finished this would not be an issue.
the problem with using such an oven on Yom Tov is primarily a practical one; most modern ovens have an auto shut-off feature that turns the oven off after around 6-12 hours. Yet another problem, applicable on both Shabbos and Yom Tov, is that many models have lights or fans that are activated and deactivated as the door is opened or closed. In summary, a modern oven without Sabbath Mode may be completely unusable on Shabbos and Yom Tov.
Ovens with “Sabbath Mode”:
Buying an oven with Sabbath Mode will alleviate many of these problems. Sabbath Mode will generally disable the oven’s display panel and any electronic controls, as well as disengage the fans and lights from being activated by opening and closing the oven door. The Sabbath Mode feature will also disable the auto shut-off feature. However, one very big problem, at least with regards to most models, is that the thermostat usually remains operative. [Some ovens have a light which illuminates when the heating element is on, in which case the oven could theoretically be opened when the light is on. However, it has been demonstrated through rigorous testing that these indicator lights are generally inaccurate, and may be illuminated even when the heating element is off.]
The thermostat does not present a problem for Yom Tov use, but makes it completely forbidden on Shabbos, according to most opinions. The outcome is that, ironically, the Sabbath Mode oven remains forbidden for Shabbos use, and is permitted only on Yom Tov. Perhaps it would have been more apt to name this feature “Yom Tov Mode”.
There is a practical workaround for Shabbos use that is easy and simple: Estimate about what time the main course will be served, and make sure that the oven turns off before then. This is generally easy to achieve, as the Sabbath Mode feature can usually be set to turn the oven off in any increment amount of time up until 72 or 96 hours. So, you can easily set the oven to go off after 2 or 3 hours, for example. Once the oven is off, opening the door does not create a problem with regards to the thermostat.
However, this method will usually create a new problem, which requires its own workaround. Now that the oven is off, this means that Sabbath Mode is now deactivated as well, and opening the door will turn the light on (if the oven has a light). This can be circumvented before Shabbos by manipulating the magnets or levers that detect whether the door is open. The specific manner of circumvention will vary from model to model, and in the case of magnetic detectors, may take some trial-and-error. Some oven doors are designed to be taken apart to allow proper cleaning of all the glass panes, and the magnet can be physically removed from the door. In other models, it may work to place a strong and thin magnet on the oven wall at the correct place.(The location of the oven’s magnet can usually be detected by sliding a paperclip around the top of the oven door.) These options may or may not work, depending on the model, so you would have to try before Shabbos, when you have the time and patience to troubleshoot it. [Note: Disabling the magnetic sensor only helps with regards to the functions controlled by the door sensor, such as the oven light and fans. However, the thermostat is not controlled by the door sensor, which is why the oven needs to be off before opening the door on Shabbos.]
Following the advice above, when Shabbos is followed by Yom Tov, one would have to choose whether to reserve the oven’s use for Shabbos or Yom Tov, as using it on Shabbos would require the oven to be set to turn off on Shabbos, in which case it will remain off for the duration of Yom Tov as well.
The Issur of Sheiyah with regards to an oven:
The above answer focuses purely on using the oven itself. However, there are also restrictions about which foods may be placed in an oven before Shabbos without a Blech, and much discussion about whether, and how, a Blech can be facilitated in an oven. Here is a brief summary of the issues:
From the Torah perspective, one may place food over an open flame before Shabbos in order that it cooks on Shabbos. Nevertheless, Chazal forbade this due to the concern that a person may come to stoke the fire on Shabbos in order to speed up the cooking process. This prohibition is knownas Shehiya.
One method of avoiding Shehiya is to cover the flames, typically with a Blech. Covering the fire indicates that one does not desire a strong flame, it diverts his attention from the fire, and it serves as a reminder not to increase the flames. With regards to an oven, there is a dispute whether – and how – a Blech can be adequately created. In practice, a Blech in an oven should be situated so that it covers the heating elements, which may be located either at the top of the oven, the bottom or the backwall. In many ovens, there are heating elements in all of these places.
Another way of addressing Shehiya, and to sidestep the need for a Blech, is to ensure that the food is cooked prior to Shabbos. It is sufficient if the food is already half cooked.  This fraction does not represent time, but rather, is qualitative and measured against the degree of cooking most people would regard as fully cooked. Nevertheless, for a number of reasons, it is best that the food be fully baked before Shabbos.
There is yet a third possible way to circumvent the prohibition of Shehiya. Chazal allowed one to put completely raw meat on an open flame just before the onset of Shabbos. They were not concerned that one might come to stoke the flames, because doing so would not serve any productive purpose – it would not ready the meat in time for the Friday night meal, nor would it be necessary to ready the meat in time for the Shabbos day meal. This leniency is known as “Kidra Chaysa” – literally: raw pot. (Indeed, some people may wish to put raw chicken and rice right before Shabbos to slow bake in the oven for the daytime Seudas Shabbos.)
In order for this leniency to apply, two criteria must be met. First, the food item must be one that takes a relatively long time to cook properly (such as meat). Second, the food must be put on the fire just before Shabbos, late enough that it will not begin cooking before Shabbos comes in. Some contemporary Poskim therefore assert that this leniency seldom applies nowadays, because most modern cooking appliances are able to cook in a relatively short amount of time. As a case in point, meat put up to cook rightat the  onset of Shabbos would usually be fit for consumption by the time the meat course  arrives. Even if the heat is set to low, this does not diminish the oven’s overall ability to bake quickly, because the seat heating can be easily raised. Thus, according to these Poskim, this option is not applicable to a modern oven.
Other associated issues:
1. It should be pointed out that even when the oven is off and cold, if it will be turned on with a Shabbos clock or a timer (see next point), one may not place inside any food which is not completely cooked. Furthermore, even completely cooked food that has cooled down may not be placed inside either, unless the food is completely dry (and will remain dry when heated). The same applies to an oven which will remain off but has  not yet cooled down.
2. With regards to Shabbos clocks in general, the Rebbe writes in a letter (Igros Kodesh Vol 12 page 192): “There are those who are extremely stringent and are even sceptical about the permissibility of using a Shabbos clock… Therefore, I am abstaining from giving this idea in an official capacity.” Even so, it is reported that the Rebbe instructed some individuals that they may be used (See Shulchan Menachem Volume 2 page 173).  At the same time, many authorities who permit Shabbos clocks in general nevertheless rule that they should not be used with regards to cooking specifically, for a number of reasons.

" Can giving money towards a Kallahs gifts before her wedding (bridal shower), be taken from Tzedaka money (Maasar)?
Asking regarding friends, as well as acquaintances that I wouldn’t necessarily buy a gift for, but want to help towards their marriage.","
One may use maaser to buy a gift for a chosson/kallah, provided that the following conditions are in place:
The chosson/kallah are considered poor and eligible to receive maaser.
It’s not an expected norm that people give gifts to chosson/kallah.
You have not already resolved to give a gift, prior to your thought of using maaser money.
See also:
Can I use Maaser money towards airfare to go to a friend’s wedding?
Follow-up Questions:
1. What makes someone “poor”? Many people do not have enough money to pull off wedding expenses…
2. While it can be the norm to give gifts, one doesn’t MUST give a gift, so a gift might be given with only the intention of helping the kallah who needs it. (Or to make her happy).  Does that count?
3. On another note, does maasar need to be given from the monthly interest earned from the bank?
Answers:
1. Each case can be different. The general rule is if someone’s salary doesn’t cover their expenses for that year they may take tzedakah. For example if he makes $1,500 a month and it cost him $2,000 a month to live he will be able to collect the $500 from tzedakah.
 ומ  ’ ’ .
While it is true many people do not have enough money to pull off wedding expenses and they would be halachicly permitted to take from tzedakah, some choose instead to take a loan and when things are easier and there are less expenses they pay back that loan at a slower pace rather than take tzedakah. Obviously the latter is the preferred option if possible. But if it’s not possible as mentioned above they would be permitted to take money from tzedakah for the wedding.
2. A simple test to determine this would be: ask yourself whether you would give the gift if you wouldn’t be able to use maaser funds for it. If the answer is yes then you wouldn’t be able to use maaser funds for the gift, if not you would be able to use maaser funds. If you would have bought a cheaper gift then the difference would be able to come from maaser.

  What should one say (if anything) to people in Crown Heights carrying something on Shabbos R”L because of the “Eiruv”?.
 ###answer 
 This is not something unique to Crown Heights. This applies to any community where an Eiruv is rumored to have been erected, but it is done without consultation and support of the local Rabbonim, nor with any endorsement of any recognized Posek.

" Can a lady give a Shiur to men?
Full Question:
I run a lunch and learn in my office, the crowd is mixed and diverse, and we bring different speakers every week. It was suggested from our main sponsor to have a lady (who is fully Frum and Tznius) to give the Shiur/lecture. Is this permissible? Obviously, I am in a sensitive position. If the answer is in the negative, I would need to present it to the local rabbinic authority, and present the sources in Halacha.","
This is not proper for a religious crowd. Poskim advise against this. (Men need to look at the speaker, and to have men looking at a woman speak for a long period of time is not Tznius. We find in the Poskim that by the age of 9, it is important to have only male teachers).
Some poskim even forbid it outright.

However, if the crowd is not religious, and the purpose is to teach them Torah, there could be some room for leniency in very specific scenarios, and one should seek guidance from a Rav.","###question

 May one interrupt while reading Shnayim Mikra?,"The Alter Rebbe (OC 285:6) states that some are accustomed to read the entire week’ s Shnayim Mikra without interruption at all, but that according to the basic Halacha, one may interrupt it and read “one Parsha today . . and another Parsha tomorrow”. [In this context, Parsha refers to a segment of Pesukim in the Torah that appears without any space between the Pesukim, also known as וו וומו.]
This implies that if one does not wish to read the entire week’s Shnayim Mikra at once, he may interrupt only when there is a break in the Torah between Parshiyos.
From this it can be inferred that:
1. It is ideal to read the entire week’s Shnayim Mikra without interruption at all.
2. It is acceptable to pause when there is a break in the Torah between Parshiyos.
3. One should not interrupt within a Parsha at all.
Although point 3 is only implicit in the Alter Rebbe, the Mishna Brura (Shaar Hatziyon 285:11) states this explicitly.

" How can I enter my building on Shabbos if the door can only be opened with an electric key?
I need an electric key to enter the building I live in (attached is a picture of the key). On Shabbos, they try to put something in the door that it shouldn’t lock, sometimes though some ום from the building take it out and it gets locked. The question therefore is:
1. Can one carry this key on their bendel on Shabbos?
2. Can one give the key on Shabbos to a goy passing by (and ask them) to open the door
Note, there is no other way to enter the building!","
The key is Muktzah given that its primary purpose cannot be used for Shabbos. It therefore cannot be touched with one’s hands. If it is the only key on the Bendel, you would not be able to put the Bendel on or take it off with your hands. However, you may attach the key to a Bendel which has other regular keys that are at least as significant, and the Bendel may then be put on and taken off, but without touching this actual key. [Although it would normally be ideal to remove Muktzah keys before Shabbos, this is not a requirement.]
Asking a Goy to open the door for you, would be permitted, being that it is a Psik Reisha. Also, it is a Shevus Dshevus in a case of reasonably great need.

 Am I allowed to eat in a married woman’s kitchen if she does not cover her hair?,"This depends on various factors. Firstly, do you know if she keeps the basic kosher standards that are not necessarily kept by all kosher consumers such as: Cholov Yisrael and Pas Yisrael, etc..? In other words, what is her official standards?
Is she knowledgeable and active in checking salads for bugs? Does she check eggs for blood spots? Does she understand that there are many hechsherim and not all of them are acceptable to Anash?
If it seems to you that her knowledge seems adequate to run a kosher kitchen to your liking, then we need to consider the second question: can you rely on her Yiras Shamayim due to the fact that she does not cover her hair?
This would depend on her upbringing. For example, if she is only starting to become frum the reason for not covering her hair might be because she knows that many Orthodox women do not cover their hair and she considers herself like one of them, (of course this is wrong, but it is her nisayon – challenge). If so, it could be acceptable to eat in her home if otherwise, her Yiras shamayim seems to be good in all other aspects.
If, however, she has had a frum upbringing and now does not cover her hair, then this is a negative reflection on her yiras shamayim. This is since there is no true justified reason she can have that she is not covering her hair.
Therefore, the matter would depend on your kosher standards and the specifics of some of the above-mentioned points to consider.","###question

On Yom Tov however we are permitted to raise a (real, not electric) fire, but we may not extinguish it or lower it, and therefore this halacha does not apply for Yom Tov. However, it is still forbidden to actually raise/lower an electric appliance.
Therefore you may use an electric appliance without worry about the knobs/buttons, just make sure not to actually use the knobs/buttons."

" What is the minimum of Challah one can eat and still be able to wash & Bentch?
I try to keep the minhag of melave malka every week, including washing. Sometimes it’s hard to eat a lot after having eaten recently at the Shabbos meal…
What is the minimum of challah/Matzah one can eat and still be able to wash/bentch?
Over the years I’ve seen many different places where there is a weight amount or, worse yet, a description such as “kazayis” or “kabeitza” to describe food shiurim, and those leave a person very confused as to the exact amount of food. Would the Rav be so kind as to describe the size of a piece of challah or the amount of matzah (usually box Square Matzah)? (E.g. The amount of challah comparable to a golf ball or two golf balls etc or a different item that the challah could be measured against).
Additionally, does the shiur consist of only the hamotzi food, or could something that’s put on top of the challah/matzah also count as part of the shiur? (Let’s say if someone puts egg salad or tuna salad on challah, can this be counted and this way one eats let’s of the actual hamotzi food but can nevertheless still wash and bench).
And finally, is there a time frame in which one needs to eat the shiur?","
One must wash (without a Bracha) and make Hamotzi for even the smallest amount.
One must wash with a Bracha if he’s planning on eating a K’beitza. This is approximately 2 K’zeizim. Each K’zayis should be eaten within K’dei Achilas Pras (= 4 minutes) and without pausing between the two of them.
One must make a Birchas Hamazon if he ate a K’zayis of bread within 4 minutes. Other foods do not count for this amount.
If 4 minutes proves to be too difficult, one can be lenient and eat it within 6 minutes but should eat approximately the size of 1/3 of a K’beitza within 4 minutes. If one is not sure if it was eaten in the right amount of time – if he is satiated, he should still make a Birchas Hamazon.
Torah measurements are usually volume-based, not weight. A K’zayis is the approximate volume of half an average size egg. A K’beizah is the volume of an average size egg. Nonetheless, for simplicity, they have been converted to weight measurements, although the weight measurements are far from accurate. This is because different foods with an equal volume weigh differently. The following is the weight for water; bread and certainly matzah weighs less. For a K’beitza this is approx. 53.8 gram or 1.89 oz. For a K’zayis, approx. 25.6 gram or 0.90 oz.
One-third of a standard square machine matza is approximately a K’zayis. With bread, it is harder to measure, as they are not uniform but it is approximately the size of what would fit into a small l’chaim cup. In order to be safe, one should err on the side of caution and eat slightly more than the shiur, due to a number of reasons, among them since some crumbs remain between the teeth.

 Are Potato Chips/Pringles with an OU Fine?,"Potato chips – fried potato chips should be Bishul Yisroel. However steam cooked potato chips do not need to be exclusively bishul Yisroel.
Pringles – there is a Machlokes in regards to regular Potato chips if they need to be Bishul Yisroel and one should be stringent as mentioned, however, even according to the lenient opinion, there is room to be more stringent in regards to pringles.
Reasoning:
Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh Deah 113:1) requires Bishul Yisroel only on foods that are Oleh Al Shulchan Melachim (that would be served at the meals of royalty).
The Chachmas Adom 66:4 writes that foods like potato cuttings require to be Bishul Yisroel.
Although most opinions maintain that we define Oleh al Shulchan Melachim solely by the fact how it is served right now (if it is fit for a meal of royalty), since a fried potato would require to be bishul Yisroel, the potato chip should also be bishul Yisroel,
despite the fact that it is cut thin.
This would be analogous to a piece of meat: one cannot say that only certain cuts of meat that are fancy require Bishul Yisroel and non-fancy cuts of meat do not require Bishul Yisroel.
However If the potato chips are steam cooked, it does not require to be bishul Yisroel (see Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 113:13).
Pringles made from potato starch or potato flour – if the potato was cooked first it would have needed to be bishul Yisroel before it was turned into potato starch.
Therefore, Pringles are different than potato chips since during the process they were already cooked like regular potatoes even though they are dried afterward. Thus, it is problematic even for those who would argue that potato chips are fine, since the original Issur when it was cooked by a non-Jew remains. (Those who allow it use certain leniencies and some claim it’s better than potato chips.)

 Does one need to ask a Rav before being induced? Is there any Halachic issue?,"
This matter is discussed in a number of Poskim. The general rule is that one may not induce or rush the onset of labor unless there are clear medical reasons to require it. Some of the reasons for this prohibition are because:
There is a level of risk inherent to childbirth, and one should therefore not hasten it even though it is bound to come.
The special assurance of protection Hashem provides at the time of childbirth does not necessarily apply to the same degree if the birth is hastened without a clear medical need.
The procedures and/or medicines involved in induction can themselves cause complications, and one should not take that risk needlessly.","###question

" Is a toy frog “Kosher”, since it’s one of the מו?
This may be more of a “chassidishe rov” question than a pure halacha question, but I would still be happy to hear your thoughts.
My wife and I are careful to minimize our son’s exposure to non-kosher animals, based on what we understand to be the Rebbe’s instructions, although I have never seen the sources myself. Recently, though, we wanted to get him a lot of new toys, and one thing I bought him was a toy frog, which I assumed was fine since it’s one of the מו. He really likes it, so he still plays with it even now, but we started wondering if maybe it was a mistake to give it to him since it’s not kosher. Should we let him keep it, or work on distracting him from it and giving him something else instead?

The takana to learn chitas is on an individual basis, where everyone will finish the Chumash and Tanya throughout the year. And the Tehillim on a monthly basis.
Splitting up the chitas is not the ideal method, since you as an individual will not have completed the above. There is however some merit in it, since you, as part of a group, will have it completed (similar to the division of Shas has done on 19 Kislev, although as noted, this was not the original takana of chitas).
I suggest that in addition to splitting it among your friends, you also try to learn just the Chumash without Rashi, or to cover a certain amount throughout the day and complete the rest at a later point.The same can be with Tehilim (first kapital) and Tanya.","###question

Absolutely unacceptable. Even with married staff, there are concerns, certainly with teenagers. It is obvious that single boys and girls working together will undoubtedly lead to a sub-conscious laxity in tznius, and can extend even outside the workspace as they get more comfortable with each other, or in general, they can become comfortable with the opposite gender – a breach of the wall of tznius that exists in our society where boys/girls are kept separate. Often the staff will need to be in contact regarding different matters (transportation, trips, deliveries, etc.) that will require direct communication via cell phone, with its consequences.
I would rather not elaborate on such a topic, but many issues have arisen from such camps, with many having long-term effects. (I want to add that putting boys/girls in this situation with these challenges is a severe violation of Lifnei Iver, and very unfair to them, especially if they are/were unaware.

"I know we don’t cut on Thursday, but is Wednesday night included too? Because the day starts from the night before.
Also, it there an inyan not to cut at nights (any other night)?","
Nails shouldn’t be cut on Wednesday night – like Thursday.
Regarding nights in general –
May I cut my hair and nails after chatzos (midday)?
Sifrei Kabbalah (Holy writings of Kabbalah) relate that the Arizal would refrain from having his hair cut after midday. Some are of the opinion that the same would apply to cutting nails. The question is: what was the reason for this custom?
If it was because we shouldn’t engage in any new melachah (work) once the zman (time) of Mincha has arrived—lest we be distracted from davening Mincha—then we can assume that there is no issue with cutting our hair after having davened Mincha. Nails, however, may be cut even before davening Mincha.
However, if the reason was that according to Kabbalah the forces of dinim (Heavenly judgment) begin gaining strength after midday, it would be cause to refrain from doing so throughout the entire afternoon, and in fact more so at night, when the dinim are even more severe. Although the influence of the forces of dinim is mentioned specifically only regarding haircuts, it can arguably be applied to nail cutting too.
Common practice, though, is that we do take haircuts and cut our nails after midday—provided that we have davened Mincha—and at night as well. Likewise, If one has a fixed minyan for davening Mincha, one need not refrain from engaging in melacha prior to davening.","###question

May I cut my hair and nails after chatzos (midday)?
Sifrei Kabbalah (Holy writings of Kabbalah) relate that the Arizal would refrain from having his hair cut after midday. Some are of the opinion that the same would apply to cutting nails. The question is: what was the reason for this custom?
If it was because we shouldn’t engage in any new melachah (work) once the zman (time) of Mincha has arrived—lest we be distracted from davening Mincha—then we can assume that there is no issue with cutting our hair after having davened Mincha. Nails, however, may be cut even before davening Mincha.
However, if the reason was that according to Kabbalah the forces of dinim (Heavenly judgment) begin gaining strength after midday, it would be cause to refrain from doing so throughout the entire afternoon, and in fact more so at night, when the dinim are even more severe. Although the influence of the forces of dinim is mentioned specifically only regarding haircuts, it can arguably be applied to nail cutting too.
Common practice, though, is that we do take haircuts and cut our nails after midday—provided that we have davened Mincha—and at night as well. Likewise, If one has a fixed minyan for davening Mincha, one need not refrain from engaging in melacha prior to davening."

The concept of ownership over intellectual property is debated in the Poskim and the general consensus is that when a publisher puts out a new book or invention, he has the right to it forever and no one may reproduce it without his permission. Many different reasons are offered to explain this halachic concept. The secular copyright laws can also apply, .
In the case of the illustrations particularly, since it’s not Torah thoughts but illustrations there is more reason to prohibit reproduction. Certainly, the publisher has the right to restrict others from using them without permission. Even for classroom usage one would need their permission.","###question

 If a child has a dirty diaper is there an issue of me davening or saying Hashem’s name within 4 Amos?,"If the child is of age that he can eat a kezayis of grain within the amount of time that it takes an adult to eat a pras of grain (approx. 7 minutes), usually at the age of one year and older (but often even younger), one must keep a distance from his urine and excrements.
The distance is 4 Amos from where the smell finishes, and they may not have it in their vision line when davening even if it’s more than 4 Amos away.
Nonetheless, it’s good and proper to daven in a clean place, even from excrements (not urine) of a one-day-old child, if it’s easy to do so, although it’s not forbidden.
If the excrement is inside a pamper, one may daven nearby, provided there is no foul odor. Likewise, one may daven near urine in a pamper, if it’s not wet to the touch on the outside, to the extent that anything touching it could cause wetness to another item.
Some are stringent that if one is aware that the pamper is dirty with excrement — not if it only contains urine— they must treat the pamper like a toilet bowl, and keep a distance of 4 Amos, even if there is no smell and may not have it in their vision line when davening even if its more than 4 Amos away.

 Do apricots or honey need a Hechsher?,"Honey:
Raw unflavored honey which is 100% pure and filtered may be used without a Hechsher. However, retail size honey often goes through heating which can be a problem when using shared equipment. It is therefore recommended to purchase honey only with a Hechsher. One must ensure that no other ingredients are added like alcohol and sweeteners. Additionally, the honey needs to be filtered very well from any pieces of the bees that can get mixed in it.
Apricots:
Fresh apricots do not require a Hechsher unless they are from Eretz Yisroel. Even dried apricots, if produced out of Eretz Yisroel (usually they are made in Turkey), do not require a Hechsher, provided they are unflavored, and without additives, since no other ingredients go in the drying process. Sulfur dioxide added is not a concern. However, some apricot companies season their apricots with flavoring to give their apricots a unique taste. Therefore, to be on the safer side it is best to buy only with a Hechsher as food processing is always changing. One must certainly ensure the apricots are insect free. They must be checked appropriately.","###question

In conclusion, unless you meet all the above requirements, it cannot be done.
See also the following excerpts from our Day to Day Halachic Guide:
MOBILE SUKKAH
A person who is traveling without access to a Sukkah, can create a Sukkah out of a vehicle (or two), as follows:
LOCATION
The spot you choose should be semi-secluded, and not on a public path where it would interfere with foot traffic. It should also be a safe, crime-free area, where you would technically be able to sleep at night. It should also fulfill the other requirements for the positioning of a Sukkah – the area above the s’chach free of tree limbs or overhangs
ASSEMBLY
Use the front and back door of a single vehicle (on the same side) or open a single door on mirroring sides of two vehicles. (The interior of a convertible or roadster that fits all the dimensions below can be used as well.)
The area created by the three sides (either the two doors and the one car body, or the two car bodies and the adjacent doors) has to be at least seven tefachim long and seven tefachim wide (about 22.5 inches on each side).
The doors must reach ten tefachim (3.25 feet) in height and start no more than three tefachim (9.5 inches) off the ground. Parking near a curb and opening the door(s) over the curb will help in this regard.
The doors must be fully and firmly open, so that a gust of wind will not slam them closed.
ROOF
It is preferable not to prop the s’chach directly on the car doors, but to first place wood laths or the like across and the s’chach on top of that. The s’chach should be fixed to the “roof” with jute twine or string (not zip ties) so that it will not blow away.
The above is set up in such a way that the “walls” of the Sukkah are adjacently perpendicular to the s’chach. If there is an area of four amos (six feet) of car roof on any side of the Sukkah or four tefachim (13 inches) of car roof or other unkosher covering in the middle of the Sukkah, it is unusable.115 If the mobile Sukkah is of the smallest possible size (seven by seven tefachim), any three-tefach span of car roof – whether in the middle or on the side – will invalidate it.
USE
You must hold your food or put it down on a table or surface inside your makeshift Sukkah. You may not eat under the s’chach and use the seat in the car (outside your Sukkah) as your table.
You must stipulate that the vehicle(s) will be able to be used for (non-holy) purposes after the Sukkah is dismantled, since, as stated above, we are usually not allowed to use the parts of a Sukkah for another purpose once they were used for a mitzvah.","###question

A. I cannot imagine it would be washed in a dishwasher. It normally would be washed by itself.
For extra measure, you can do “milui virui”: It should be filled up with (ambient) water and simultaneously submerged in water for 24 hours. That water should then be emptied and it should repeated for another 24 hours, then emptied and then repeated for another 24 hours."

"Is there an exception to that “rule”, like when auspicious days fall out on Shabbos? (i.e. are we supposed to go ahead and ask anyway?)","
According to Halacha one may not request their needs on Shabbos.
One of the reasons for this is because Shabbos accomplishes everything by itself without the need for us to resort to asking for it.  Even when Rosh Hashana or Yom Kippur – which are the most auspicious days of the year to request all of our needs – fall out on Shabbos we do not request our needs with Avinu Malkeinu.
You can make all your requests after Shabbos ends, especially regarding Yud Tes kislev which we celebrate the 20th of kislev as well.
Additionally, anything which is part of the standard text of davening is permitted. Thus, you may have your requests in mind in the Davening of Shabbos, especially during the sections of davening which we say on Shabbos for personal needs (which are permitted being that they are part of the Nussch which the Chachomim instituted) like Yehi Rotzon in the morning Berochos, the middle Beracha of Shabbos Shemone Esrei, Eloki Netzor at the end of Shemone Esrei, Brich Shmei when the Aron Hakodesh is opened and Yekum Purkan and Mi Shebeirach before Musaf. It is important that we have extra kavana when reciting these tefillos. This is more preferred over any personal prayers.
As well, requests for a Refuah Shleima of critically sick person or spiritual requests are permitted on Shabbos. However we do not confess our sins on Shabbos.
We must use out these auspicious days especially when they fall out on Shabbos for extra Davening, learning, Farbrengen and undertaking good resolutions.","###question

"Q1. For heartburn/acid reflux, may one chew Tums with letters on Shabbos? If not, what should one do?","A. Swallowing pills with letters isn’t a problem. The issue is eating where it breaks before swallowing.

If one is bedridden or his pain causes a sickness/ weakness in the entire body (such as severe pain where one cannot function).
If one has no choice as all foods cause heartburn.

Am I allowed to open and close the radiator knob in my apartment?","
On Shabbos, it is forbidden to turn on the taps of the radiator as this causes the cold water in the radiator to flow into the boiler, where it would be heated.
You cannot turn on the taps even if the heating system is not yet operating but will be turned on during Shabbos.
It is permissible to turn off the taps of the radiator on Shabbos, however it is proper to refrain from doing so as long as the water inside the radiator is in the process of being heated and has not yet reached a temperature of 113 degrees Fahrenheit (45 degrees Celsius).
This is because turning off the taps causes the water in the boiler to reach a temperature of 113 degrees Fahrenheit more quickly than it otherwise would.

The definition of Keli B’toch Keli is that at least one Keli isn’t designed specifically for this holy item.
There is a disagreement how to interpret the concept of “not being designated”. In fact, some authorities allow preparing in advance two coverings with the intention of it being considered Keli B’toch Keli, even though both coverings were made for the holy item.

Otherwise, it’s not a sufficient covering. However, the plain reading of the Halacha is that a cover which was designated in advance is never acceptable.

 What are the Halachos of Yichud when using Uber? ,"Uber:
Almost all of the Halachos of driving a regular car apply to a taxi or Uber, i.e. one may travel when it is lit up and during the time when there are people in the street (on those streets), and the windows are not tinted in a way that someone can’t see into the car.( ם מום  ’  ” )
However, there are those that are Machmir and hold that wherever possible, one should not travel with a non-Jew or a ‘Parutz’ even by day  ( מ   ז ’ ). With an Uber there is more room for leniency, as there are governing laws of the company for drivers, with GPS monitoring.
Parutz:
There is a Machlokes in Poskim how to define a Parutz. One must be especially careful in this regard when exposed to Yichud on a regular basis, such as in a workplace.
It is clear that a person who is not particular with the Issur of Kriva L’arayos and does not keep the guidelines of Tznius, even if he otherwise a Shomer Torah U’mitzvos, is  certainly considered  a Parutz. For example, a man who has no inhibitions about embracing women or girls, one who regularly watches television, reads unsuitable material, frequents indecent chat rooms on the internet, or visits movie theaters is considered a Parutz. The mere exposure to immodesty affects their morality. See Toras HaYichud 3:2:4. Shevet Halevi Vol. 5:202:1.
A man whose business dealings are questionable might be considered a Parutz in relation to Yichud — see Nitei Gavriel Yichud 22:9.
Furthermore, the average non-observant Jew is to be considered a Parutz too. The Tzemach Tzedek E”H 39 rules, that the definition of Anashim Ksheirim is one who has a special Chezkas Kashrus, such as a Talmid Chacham, and the standard Chezkas Kashrus of all Klal Yisroel isn’t sufficient. It seems that it need not be Mamosh a Talmid Chacham; it could be a Yeshiva Bachur etc., but it is not enough that we are not aware of any Pritzus behavior. See also Nitei Gavriel Yichud 19:3,10.

However, there are those that are Machmir and hold that wherever possible, one should not travel with a non-Jew or a ‘Parutz’ even by day  ( מ   ז ’ ). With an Uber there is more room for leniency, as there are governing laws of the company for drivers, with GPS monitoring.
Parutz:
There is a Machlokes in Poskim how to define a Parutz. One must be especially careful in this regard when exposed to Yichud on a regular basis, such as in a workplace.
It is clear that a person who is not particular with the Issur of Kriva L’arayos and does not keep the guidelines of Tznius, even if he otherwise a Shomer Torah U’mitzvos, is  certainly considered  a Parutz. For example, a man who has no inhibitions about embracing women or girls, one who regularly watches television, reads unsuitable material, frequents indecent chat rooms on the internet, or visits movie theaters is considered a Parutz. The mere exposure to immodesty affects their morality. See Toras HaYichud 3:2:4. Shevet Halevi Vol. 5:202:1.
A man whose business dealings are questionable might be considered a Parutz in relation to Yichud — see Nitei Gavriel Yichud 22:9.
Furthermore, the average non-observant Jew is to be considered a Parutz too. The Tzemach Tzedek E”H 39 rules, that the definition of Anashim Ksheirim is one who has a special Chezkas Kashrus, such as a Talmid Chacham, and the standard Chezkas Kashrus of all Klal Yisroel isn’t sufficient. It seems that it need not be Mamosh a Talmid Chacham; it could be a Yeshiva Bachur etc., but it is not enough that we are not aware of any Pritzus behavior. See also Nitei Gavriel Yichud 19:3,10.

True, there is no issue of nolad in the case of a kugel that emits a small amount of oil. However, there certainly is an issue of bishul.

 Is there an Inyan in saying Hallel with the Minyan?,"Yes.
One should make an extra effort to be holding with the Minyan for Hallel. The Rebbe once told someone who was accustomed to daven be’arichus that he should begin prior to the Minayn so that when they reach Hallel he should be holding with them. Similarly, the Rebbe writes in Igros Kodesh: ”Despite the fact that our Rebbeim would extend their Shabbos prayers over many hours – long after the congregation had concluded the service – they would nevertheless organize their time on Yom Tov so that they would conclude the amidah with the congregation and then recite Hallel together with them”.
This applies not only to Rosh Chodesh (and other times we recite chatzi Hallel), when there is a safek in regards to the proper way the Bracha on Hallel should be recited, but also to Chanukah and other Yomim Tovim -when regardles a Bracha on Hallel is said because the complete Hallel is recited- for there are other reasons that Hallel should be recited with the Minayn (namely, to answer וו and  with the Minyan; it is more honorable to praise Hashemin public; to publicise the miracles we are praising Hashem for).","###question

"1) Do I need to make a new Brocha if I change my Tzitzis midday (after exercise, for example)?","2a) If I merely try-on a pair of Tzitizis, or otherwise plan to soon take them off—is a Brocha still required?
2b) What if I try them on over another pair of Tzitzis? Do I need to make a Brocha for both pairs?
Answers:
1) Yes. 
A new Mitzvah is performed every time one wears a four-cornered garment with Tzitzis. Therefore, a Bracha should be made each time one puts on Tzitzis.
2-a) Yes. 
As long as one benefits from wearing a garment, Tzitzis is required and a Brocha should therefore be made (benefit can include simply not being without Tzitzis even for a moment). (According to Poskim, wearing the Tzitzis for the time it takes to walk four cubits (3 seconds) qualifies as “deriving benefit”.)
2-b) No. 
As mentioned, each four-cornered garment you wear is an additional Mitzvah and therefore requires a new Bracha (no matter how many pairs you are wearing). In this case, however, you are merely trying-on the Tzitzis for size and no benefit is had. And unlike above, the benefit of avoiding being temporarily without the Mitzva is also absent (since you have not taken off your own Tzitzis).","###question

How to use a toilet which flushes by a sensor?,"Where no other bathroom is available, you may use an auto-flush toilet by activating the sensor in an irregular manner, for example walking away on your heels or sides of the feet in an uncomfortable manner. Ideally, you should first place a tissue or paper towel over the sensor, in a manner that it will eventually fall off later by itself, so that the toilet won’t flush immediately when you leave the toilet.
How to use water from a faucet which is operated only by sensor?
You should use a bottle of water or another cleanser.
Where this is not possible: After using the bathroom, you may satisfy with rubbing your hands with a cloth or other material, unless you’re planning on davening thereafter, in which case you may ask a non-Jew to fill up a cup of water for you. If however, you want to wash your hands before davening but you did not use the bathroom or touch parts of the body that are usually covered, you should just rub your hands. For washing before bread or upon awakening in the morning, you may also ask a non-Jew to fill up water for you.

• Generally:
For a child whose birthday is from after Lag Baomer until Erev Shavuos, the Upshernish haircut should take place on Erev Shavuos. [When Erev Shavuos falls on Shabbos – on 4 Sivan (with the exception of someone whose birthday is on Erev Shavuos, in which case it should be postponed until after Shavuos)].

• However, regarding someone whose birthday is on 19 Iyar, a day after Lag Baomer:
There are instructions from the Rebbe to perform the haircut on Lag Baomer.
While in most places it appears that it should take place on Lag Baomer itself (during the day), a day before the child turns 3, others record that it should be done on the actual birthday, right after nightfall on the night after Lag Baomer.
See here the testimony of three people who were all instructed by the Rebbe to do it on Lag Baomer: R. SB Popak, R. YY Hecht and R. Refoel Hartman. In the case of R. Hecht, the Rebbe himself did the cutting. (This information has been independently verified by us). In the case of R. Hartman, we have the actual answer of the Rebbe.
Independent of the above, there is yet another directive presented regarding the Upshernish of Ari Halberstam hy”d (whose birthday is on 19 Iyar), of which there are pictures of the Rebbe cutting the hair. See in the Hebrew references below.
This account raises several questions. Regardless, I feel there is enough information to rely upon to do it on Lag Baomer (by day).","###question

 How many women must be in a house in the evening if a man is there and his wife is in the city but out of the house for the evening?,"A man may not be with even two women as this is yichud.
According to many poskim, this applies even to more than two women. This is the accepted practice.
However, some poskim maintain that more than two women is permissible. When desperate, and no other choices are available there might be room to rely on this position.
Even according to the lenient position, by night or when traveling, some say that even many women is forbidden. Others say it would need to be four women. This is the accepted position, in desperate situations, as mentioned.
If one has a job which the nature of the job brings him in contact with women, all agree that yichud is forbidden even with three or more women.
A wife protects from yichud only if she in the house.

  How many women must be in a house in the evening if a man is there and his wife is in the city but out of the house for the evening?.
 ###answer 
 A man may not be with even two women as this is yichud.
According to many poskim, this applies even to more than two women. This is the accepted practice.
However, some poskim maintain that more than two women is permissible. When desperate, and no other choices are available there might be room to rely on this position.
Even according to the lenient position, by night or when traveling, some say that even many women is forbidden. Others say it would need to be four women. This is the accepted position, in desperate situations, as mentioned.
If one has a job which the nature of the job brings him in contact with women, all agree that yichud is forbidden even with three or more women.
A wife protects from yichud only if she in the house.

 Which Bracha does one make on a meat barley soup?,"1. Even if there is no meat in a soup but it was cooked with meat, the taste of the meat overrides the taste of the vegetables and the Bracha is Shehakol.
2. If the soup was cooked with grain which is Mezonos, with the intention of eating the grain, the soup becomes Mezonos even when one drinks the soup on its own. This applies even if it was cooked with meat. If there is now visible meat in the soup, it is questionable whether the visible meat requires its own Bracha.
If the soup was cooked just for the liquid, the soup is Shehakol. If one is now eating the grain with the soup, one should first make Shehakol on the soup and then Mezonos on the grain.
3. If the soup is cooked with grain which is Ha’adama, the Bracha in the soup is Shehakol, regardless. If eating the grain with it, one should first say Shehakol on the soup and then Ha’adama on the grain.
4. Barley soup is questionable whether the grain is considered Mezonos or Ha’adama. If the barley kernel was split into pieces it’s Mezonos. If it’s a whole kernel, as in pearl barley, it’s Mezonos, if it’s shelled. Others say the kernels must become soft and stick to each other due to a lot of cooking, in order to become Mezonos. Otherwise, it’s Ha’adama.

" May I kick a package through the doorway into my apartment on Shabbos?
There have been package thefts in my building. On Shabbos may I kick a package through the doorway and into the apartment? There is an Eiruv Chatzeros in the building. Is the din the same on Yom Tov?","
For your situation (where an Eiruv Chatzeiros was done):
If the delivery man leaves the package in a place where it is permissible to carry on Shabbos to and from your apartment, you can bring the package into your apartment using a Shinuy – same applies to Yom Tov.
However, it is important to mention that this is only if a proper Eiruv Chatzeiros was done (which causes the entire area covered by the Eiruv to be considered within Daled Amos of the original location).
However, in a situation where there is no Eiruv Chatzeiros, you would not be allowed to move it outside of Daled Amos of the location the delivery man placed it. This applies even on Yom Tov (when carrying can be permitted in a regular circumstance), since it came from outside the Techum, it is bound by the Halachos of Techum which apply equally on Shabbos and Yom Tov.","###question

" Who Should Lead the Zimun?
Is there a Minhag for the Baal Habais to lead the Zimmun?
Is there a difference between Shabbos night and Shabbos day meal?
What if there is a kohen present?","
There is such a custom that on Friday night the host leads the zimmun. Otherwise, he may honor the guest. This custom applies even when a kohen is present.
Explanation:
Although there is a mitzvah to honor the guests, this only applied in the past when only one individual bentched and he exempted the others. Nowadays, when everyone bentches themselves there is no such mitzvah. Even in those days, if the host wished to lead the bentching himself and not honor the guest, at any time, he may do so.
A kohen takes precedence only if he is equal in Torah standing to the others. Otherwise, the Talmid Chochom precedes him. Additionally, all this applies where all attendees are hosts or all are guests (and the host isn’t joining).","###question

 Are we careful about leaving water overnight? Do we need to invert pans after cleaning?,There are two issues:,"###question 
  Are we careful about leaving water overnight? Do we need to invert pans after cleaning?.
 ###answer 
 There are two issues:"
The problem is that we need to move there already this time next year since we are not able to afford to pay rent and mortgage at the same time and we cant start building until September. Any way around this?,"
All of this applies only if there was no building whatsoever in the entire area, even a small building.
If there was indeed no building, including a structure for the construction crew, the rule is as follows:
Regarding the area of the Shul, it is not an issue.
For the residential areas, if it’s for a home for a teacher or any other communal worker, it is not an issue. There’s also room for leniency if being bought by a young couple right after marriage.
If they’re being rented out and the owner is not the one living there, it’s not an issue either.
If the owner himself is living on the property, he should build a sukkah there first and afterwards it’s not a problem. Also, a proper Chanukas Habayis should be done to consecrate the home for Torah and Davening.
Another option is to make an independent “sale” of the home to someone else for the first year, and then one may live there immediately thereafter. (Alternatively, if you already own it prior to it being finished, you can sell it right then and there, and only when it’s complete will you re-purchase it).
Regardless, you should receive approval of three Rabbonim to go ahead with either of these leniencies.
The 12 months wait does not begin when the entire building was completed; it begins from when the building was above the height of the windows.","###question

This applies according to Halacha the night after Tisha B’av. Some follow this custom on the night preceding and following every fast. This concept can apply even to to those who do not fast, if their health permits.
However, the Alter Rebbe implies that this applies only in relation to the night after the fast. Since the Alter Rebbe mentions it only regarding fasts which one takes upon themselves for atonement, it is likely he does not agree with keeping this stringency regarding other regular fasts.

Both from a halachic perspective, as well as a chinuch perspective, it would be better to teach the full Beracha, with the teacher saying word by word and the child repeating (even if they don’t say every word). This way they learn that there is only one Beracha and there is no shortcuts.

Can epoxy countertops be kashered?,"Kashering an oven:
Self-cleaning ovens:
If the oven has a self-clean setting (a “continuous cleaning” setting is not the same), the metal cover separating the actual fire from the oven cavity (where you place the food.

Koshering an oven manually is extremely difficult (without causing damage to the oven and to one’s self) and should be done only by someone who has much experience.
Non self clean ovens:

B) Will it be considered מ into the ‘Kosher’ slurpees, for the same reasoning?

Depending on the details, it would likely be permitted based on the rule of nullification in sixty times of the non-kosher.
Kavush wouldn’t  be a problem as the kosher Slurpee’s would only absorb the taste of the Keli after 24 hours, in which case it would be Pagum.
ו״ ״ז מז, .
This question should be addressed to the certifying Hechsher, if there is one, or the agencies which produce lists of kosher Slurpee’s.
Of course, it’s always best to use Slurpee’s from a kosher certified location
From what I’ve read, but haven’t verified it myself:
99.9% of Slurpee flavors are kosher pareve. The Slurpee machine operates at 28°F, too cold for there to be any blios flavor. There are also no issues of kavush because of the high turnover of product. The flavors don’t usually sit in the machines for 24 hours. The compartment in the machine is so small that the Slurpee flavor is replaced after filling a few cups.
However, Slurpee is a registered trademark sold only at 7-Eleven stores. Other gas stations or convenience stores sell similar products but more caution is needed when purchasing from them. While 7-Eleven stores mostly use the main brands which are more likely to be kosher certified, other stores may use generic-brands that are not necessarily kosher certified. If the dispenser is shared among more than one flavor, and you cannot confirm that they are all kosher, it is recommended to run the machine until there is no residue of the previous flavor before filling your cup.

▪ The time and place it was found.
2) Three people should evaluate the price and write it down.
From then on one can use the item for oneself.

 Does a garment that is 100% wool need to be checked for Shatnez?,"Yes.
According to American federal law, garments must have a label which lists the exact content of the fabric. However, this refers only to the material of the main shell fabric of the garment, but not to any threads or materials in the linings, backings, reinforcements, ornaments, padding, loops, fillings and other internal components. Thus, a label which states that the garment is 100% wool can contain as much as 2% of other materials and thus be shatnez.
Furthermore, the government is extremely lax in enforcing these laws. There isn’t also much concern for potential liability resulting from adverse reactions to the fabric, as fabric allergies are uncommon and usually not that serious. Many clothing manufacturers and distributors don’t bother therefore to identify accurately which fibers they use. They are may even deliberately misrepresent the information in order to boost their sales, since they know that they don’t much to fear from law enforcement agencies or other potential liabilities.
This is true even in places where such laws are in place. Many garments are manufactured in labor-cheap, third-world countries where mislabeling is common practice.","###question

" Can I invite someone who is in the process of converting over for a Yom-Tov meal?
There is a fine young man in our community in the process of converting. He’s so frum and aidel. Wakes up early, studies many hours of Torah per day, davens with Minyan 3 times a day, and keeps many halachic chumras.
If I see him in shul on yomtov, may I invite him over for a meal?
On one hand… We are forbidden to cook for a non-Jew.
On the other hand… If he’s not invited to learn about the chagim and experience the meals (in a sukkah), how can he properly convert?
Would it make a difference (or is it better) if I invite him without telling my wife after she already cooked the food?
Is it true the Rebbe said that there is a mitzvah of Ahavas Yisroel to ger in the process of converting? If so.. How can we ignore him?
Thank you","

All food is cooked before Yom Tov;
He is told that one may not cook for a non Jew on Yom Tov;

"I have learned in Kitzur Shulchan Aruch Siman 12 that “If you are traveling and reach the place where you wish to lodge, and ahead of you within a distance of four mil . . you must go four mil ahead in order to pray with the congregation”, How does that work with nowadays cars, and easy transportation?
In my particular case regarding Mincha, there is a minyan about 15 minutes away from where I work, stopping my work, traveling, davening, and returning to my work would take around 40 minutes.
Is this halachically required or can I daven myself at my place of work?
More generally, are there principles by which I can figure out what to do in other cases?","
Traveling to Daven with a Minyan
One must travel 18 or 24 minutes (a shiur of a mil) each way in order to daven with a minyan. Therefore, if one has a car, he should travel 24 minutes by car each way (all together 48 minutes). If one does not have a car and is walking, he should walk 24 minutes each way (all together 48 minutes).
If one is traveling and the minyan is on the way he must travel up to 72 minutes. Some say 96 minutes.
If one will incur a loss of money by attending a minyan, one is allowed to skip that minyan. However, foregoing potential profit/revenue is not considered a loss.
For general laws about this subject see the Alter Rebbe’s Shulchon Aruch 90:17.
Davening with the Minyan from afar
Regarding a case where one can’t make it to a minyan under the above circumstances, he should aim to daven at the time that the tzibur is davening for this time is an eis ratzon. He will not be yotze tevillah btzibur, but it’s still an accomplishment. Ibid 90:10.
However one may not answer ם ו if there are unclean areas between him and the minyan davening. The same applies to answering Amen on brochos as well. Ibid 90:11.
Regarding answering on the phone, one may answer Amen and all devarim shebikdusha, and there is no need to be concerned about unclean areas in between, provided there is no delay (as is common on websites with live webcams) between the bracha and Amen. However, it may not be used to be yotze havdalah or other obligations.","###question

"In order to fulfill the mitzva of זו   ו according to what the מ brings, by saying “ום ון ” – Do I need to say “” or is “ום ון” enough because I’m obviously counting to/from Shabbos?
Also, does it apply to writing also?","
An introductory comment: 
This mitzvah is already accomplished by saying the shir shel yom and there is no requirement to say it again throughout the day. Furthermore, the Rebbe suggests that the obligation, which is accomplished by saying so once a day as mentioned, exists only when anyhow counting the days of the week. The Rebbe adds that it appears that the custom isn’t in accordance with this opinion.
Nonetheless, it appears that according to this opinion there would at least be a מו ומ when counting to Shabbos.
As to your questions: 
While many sources specify saying “Yom Rishon b’Shabbos”, it’s possible that saying just “Yom Rishon” is sufficient. Perhaps, the actual count to Shabbos is achieved by saying just “Yom Rishon”, however, it is lacking the mitzvah to mention Shabbos daily.
There is a machlokes if this mitzvah applies in writing too. The common custom, among Gedolei Yisroel too, is not to be particular about writing specifically the weekday count in letters (in contrast to the monthly count).","###question

" Can I Say “Thank G-d”?
I work in a field where I interact almost exclusively with Goyim. When a client asks me “How are your doing” is it Mutar to answer “Thank G-d”? Or is it saying Shaim Hashem l’vatala?
Saying “Thank G-d Alm-ghty” (as the Rebbe seems to append whenever he says “G-d”) would come across as bizarre in a typical professional exchange. If it is forbidden, is there an alternative for Boruch Hashem in English?","
It is forbidden to answer “Thank G-d”. As it is considered saying Shem Shomayim l’vatalah.
Adding the word A-mighty doesn’t make it acceptable either; rather, it’s considered saying two names of Hashem l’vatalah. Some suggest saying “Thank the L-rd”, but not everybody considers this an acceptable option either. As for the Rebbe saying often “May G-d A-mighty bless you”, see below in the references.
There are many alternatives and you may choose whatever you are most comfortable with. For example, “Thank the One above”; “Thank G, O, D” (pronouncing the actual letters), or “Thank Him” (pointing upwards). You can choose any variation of the above, or other original ideas.
You should however not try to avoid thanking Him by using secular alternatives, such as “Thank Goodness”, as there is a Mitzvah to thank Hashem for everything.
May I add that the fact that it might sound bizarre shouldn’t be a concern; on the contrary, it is an opportunity to be Mekadesh Shem Shomayim and explain where possible and relevant your behavior, in order to show reverence to G-d, and in line with Halacha, Jewish law. Society nowadays respects people who live up to their values; bizarreness often provides an added dimension of intrigue leading to more respect and even awe.
As to your comment about Ama D’bar (the common custom of society at large) saying it, this is unfortunately true. Indeed, when Poskim caution against such behavior, they make mention of the fact that society is ignorant of this Halacha. However, it is noteworthy that the previous Rebbe remarked on this practice as follows: When a simple Jew says Gimmel Aleph Tes (G-o-t, the Yiddish equivalent of G-d) Atzmus (the very essence of Hashem) is speaking, but when a Ben-Torah says so it is [merely] a name of Hashem.

The common custom is not to go to a Beis Hakvaros at night. While many have written extensively on this topic, proving that there’s no issue whatsoever with going at night, we find in the writings of the Minchas Elazar that one is supposed to go to Davka by day.
Nonetheless, there is no halachic prohibition to go at night. Indeed, many people do go at night, especially when going to Kivrei Tzadikm. When going at night, one shouldn’t say Chapters of Tehilim.
It is noteworthy, however, that although the Rebbe would frequent the Ohel on a constant basis, as far as we know he never went at night, though many times the visit extended long into the night.
The custom is to drink but not eat before visiting the Ohel.
There is no clear source which discusses this custom vis-a-vis going at night. Some say one may eat straight until sunset. Nonetheless many have the custom not to eat from the morning. At the same time, one should certainly not go on a full stomach. If going immediately after sunset, it makes sense to stop eating a while before that.","###question

 Are all watches permissible to be worn on Shabbos? Are they Muktzeh?,"Watches are not Muktzah unless you need to press a button to see the time.
Non-working watch: According to many opinions, if the watch is not working it is Muktzah.
Electrical: Even if the watch contains a computer inside it is not Muktzah, since its main purpose is to display the time. If you know that you are likely to press the button and use the computer, you should not wear it on Shabbos. Likewise, if it has a button to produce light and you might out of habit press it at night, you should put a sticker or something to remind you not to do so on Shabbos. Some put their watch on the other hand to help them remember not to do so on Shabbos.
Room temperature: A watch that displays the room temperature may not be worn, since this watch works only due to the movements of the one wearing the watch. If it measures the temperature but does not display it unless a button is pressed, it may be worn.
Glow in the dark: If a light turns on when you go into a dark room then it is a problem; if it just glows in the dark then it is okay.
Self-winding: Some watches are powered through movement. Although many are lenient, it is best for one not to wear a self-winding watch on Shabbos, because whenever you move your hand it causes the watch to recharge, especially or once you removed it from your hand and want to put it back. Many Poskim agree that it should not be worn on Shabbos once it stopped or if it is not sufficiently recharged to last throughout Shabbos.
Solar-powered: The same applies to a solar-powered watch which will recharge when entering a place which it well lit.
 Kinetic Watch: A kinetic watch operates slightly differently, where instead of a battery, one’s movement generates the needed. This is more severe and should certainly not be worn on Shabbos, especially with kinetic watches with digital displays. All the more so, with an Eco-Drive watch which enters slow down mode when there is no light and returns to normal function (digital displays, correct second hand time, etc.) when exposed to light.
Apple watches or Fitbits are forbidden on Shabbos. Your movements activate the functions and the display, it tracks all your steps, monitors your heartbeat and so much more.
If Shabbos started and you forgot to remove your apple watch, you should take it off right away, preferably by undoing the buckle and dropping it off your hand. One cannot move freely until it’s removed.
Many Chassidim do not wear a watch at all on Shabbos or Yom Tov.

" Is Vegetarianism Compatible with Torah Values?

Although Adam Harishon was commanded to refrain from eating meat, Hashem granted Noach permission to eat meat after the mabul (flood)—for all his progeny, for all time.
On the subject of eating meat, the Torah is clear that it’s not only permitted, but preferred.

There are other times when eating meat takes on halachic significance.

What Brachah do I say when I see a River or an Ocean?
Extra tall mountains:
Yes, but only if the sights are extra wondrous, showing Hashem’s greatness, and not just any mountain
See Ketzos Hashulchan 66:14.
Birchas Hachama:
Yes (Shulchan Aruch OC 229:2).
The place where a Nes (miracle) happened to you or your parents:
Yes.
(Seder Birkas Hanehenin 13:1).
However, one needs to ascertain with a Rav if the “‘miracle” is truly one that the Halacha deems proper to make a blessing on.

A big Talmid Chacham:
Only if it’s a Talmid Chacham Muflag who is a Gadol Hador – i.e., an exceptionally tremendous Torah sage of the generation. (Seder Birkas Hanehenin 13:8). Though there have been Rabbis in the past who recited this blessing in public, in practice it’s not said. The Rebbe also advised not to say this Brocha upon seeing the previous Rebbe.

A gentile wise person:
This blessing is not recited in today’s day, since it is almost impossible that a wise gentile would be expert in all the seven wisdoms.
(see Mishna Berurah 224:10).
A gentile king:
Yes, but only if it’s a king who can sentence the death penalty.
(see Mishna Berurah 224:12).
If he can’t, the blessing is said without Hashem’s name.

“Meshane Habriyos” / “Dayan Haemes”:
• when seeing an African American, American Indian, dwarf, etc., or someone whose legs are missing, is blind, or is afflicted with pimples:
As a thumb of rule, these blessing were only recited due to the impression these creatures or people had on the one who saw them. In today’s day, these creatures or people are very common and therefore no blessing is said.

• when seeing an elephant, monkey, or ape etc.:
One does recite Meshane Habriyos when seeing them
(the Meiri in Brachos 58 writes that they have certain humanlike similarities*; additionally, regarding monkeys/apes there is also the view that they were humans that were punished after the ו ),

(Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 226:9. Sefer Birchas Hanehenin 13:13. The Rema ibid. holds that one can recite this blessing every 30 days, but in practice if one were to recite it, Hashem’s name should not be mentioned – Luach Birchas Henehenin 12:21. Mishna Berurah 226 :30. However, this has been completely omitted in Seder Birchas Henehenin ibid.).
Also note that the Nimukei Orach Chayim (225) implies that if one goes to a zoo, a couple blessings can be made, so one should not have in mind to exempt everything with one blessing.

Every person is required to give gifts or money of at least a nominal sum to two poor people on Purim. The obligation can be fulfilled through any type of gift: money, food or clothing.

It is customary to be lenient when it comes to the touch of young children who have not reached the age of Chinuch. Although the Neshama of a child is considered fully developed when they reach Bar or Bas Mitzvah, the process of Neshama entry begins when the child starts their Chinuch education.
The process really starts even earlier, with the mitzvah of Mila. Therefore, someone who is careful about the touching of a male infant from the day of Milah onward is considered “holy”.
With a baby girl this applies from when she is born or from when she is given a name.","###question

 Why do some people not drink red wine between 6 and 7 on friday?,"White wine: There is a custom not to make kiddush on Friday nights between 6 and 7. The original sources make no mention of red wine specifically; likewise, the explanations provided for the custom do not link it with the color of wine either. The accepted interpretation is that this applies to all types of wine, and according to many – even if one makes kiddush on bread.
The reason for this custom: the Gemara tells us that the hours of the day are associated with the seven Mazalos, constellations or planets – Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, each one operating hour of the day in a rotating system; these celestial forces have influence on this world during their corresponding hour. During this hour of 6-7, the constellation of Tzedek (and its corresponding angel Tzadkiel) ceases to be dominant and the constellation of Maadim takes over. Maadim (and its corresponding angel, Samael, pronounced usually as “the Samach Mem”, the source of evil who rules over this Mazal), -the mazal identified with the Esav (Edom), Amalek and Haman- is associated with negative influences and is said to be the cause of destruction, plagues, murder, sickness, and punishment, among other such causes. The Gemara tells us that those born during the hour of Maadim have a tendency towards becoming a Shochet or Mohel, a profession involving bloodshed.
Thus, it’s recommended to avoid acceptance of Shabbos through kiddush in the times when Maadim dominates, so as not to add spiritual energy to Maadim. The reason for the partcular caution when making kiddush because Chazal tell us that two angels accompany people on their way back home from shule on Friday night—a good angel and an evil angel. If the house has been prepared (the candle lit, the table set etc.), the good angel gives a blessing that the next Shabbos will be the same, and the evil angel is forced to respond Amen. If the house is not prepared for Shabbos, the evil angel wishes that the next Shabbos will be the same, and the good angel is forced to respond Amen. These two angels correspond to the Mazalos of Tzedek, Jupiter, and Maadim, Mars. Thus, at this time it’s important not to allow the negative angel dominion over us.","###question

We started a Shabbos Minyan in our community a few years ago and brought in a family Sefer Torah from another location on the מך that it’ll be read from every week.
Recently someone else brought in a new Sefer Torah and insists that ”  the new Sefer Torah must be read in every Shabbos so as to look for any mistakes that there may be.
A Bar Mitzvah boy Lained in it last week, and I doubt he was looking out for any Mistakes.
Is there any  regarding such a situation?","
It is not a Halachah but a Minhag.
Some say only the first Shabbos, some say the first 4 Shabbosim.
Some say the whole first year the new Sefer Torah should be used. The reason being that when the Ba’al Koreh is reading from the Torah the congregation will hear if he missed a word or if pronounced mistakenly etc. and with that check to see if it has any mistakes (according to this it doesn’t make a difference if it is a bar mitsvah boy who is reading or not, as it’s not about the Tzuras Ha’oisios, that only a sofer or a rav would know).
Rumor has it that in 770 after the Moshiach sefer Torah was finished and they started reading from it every week, the Rebbe mentioned that there are also other sifrei Torah in the Aron. From then on they would ask the Rebbe every week which Torah to use.
Therfore, it’s indeed appropriate (that after the first 4 weeks have passed) not to neglect the first Sefer Torah entirely, rather to make rotations.
In order to keep to the above mentioned minhag it’s advisable to have the rotation in such a way that the new Sefer Torah would be entirely read through within 2 or 3 years etc.","###question

1. Mechiras Chometz should be done even if he will still be working in the store during Pesach. but you should tell them that they cannot use the Chometz during Pesach.
2. It would depend on the agreement between the partners;
If the manager has full control and right to do as he wishes with the store – he can sell the Chometz on behalf of the store.
If he cannot do as he wishes – all the partners have to give their consent to the Mechiras Chometz. If it is not possible for you to get in touch with the other partners, Mechiras Chometz should be done regardless.

 Is an oven with Cook-time or Stop-time Mode acceptable for Shabbos use?,"There are many ovens on the market, and it is impossible in this short space to investigate and address every single model. The best we can do is provide a summary of the many issues to look out for. It is important that you read through the manuals of any model you are considering for purchase, in order to determine whether, and to what degree, the issues outlined below apply.
Thermostat:
The main problem with using a oven on Shabbos is the thermostat, which is affected by opening or closing the oven while the oven is on. When the oven door is opened, the thermostat will detect the cold air that rushes in and will activate the heating element if it is off at that moment. It is forbidden to cause this to occur, even if all the food will be removed all at once before the oven door is re-closed. [If the oven door is re-closed with some of the food remaining inside, there may be additional concerns of Bishul on Shabbos, depending on the circumstances.]  The thermostat is not a concern for Yom Tov use, but there are additional problems with a oven on Yom Tov as detailed below.
If the oven is off, like after the cook-time or stop time has finished this would not be an issue.
the problem with using such an oven on Yom Tov is primarily a practical one; most modern ovens have an auto shut-off feature that turns the oven off after around 6-12 hours. Yet another problem, applicable on both Shabbos and Yom Tov, is that many models have lights or fans that are activated and deactivated as the door is opened or closed. In summary, a modern oven without Sabbath Mode may be completely unusable on Shabbos and Yom Tov.
Ovens with “Sabbath Mode”:
Buying an oven with Sabbath Mode will alleviate many of these problems. Sabbath Mode will generally disable the oven’s display panel and any electronic controls, as well as disengage the fans and lights from being activated by opening and closing the oven door. The Sabbath Mode feature will also disable the auto shut-off feature. However, one very big problem, at least with regards to most models, is that the thermostat usually remains operative. [Some ovens have a light which illuminates when the heating element is on, in which case the oven could theoretically be opened when the light is on. However, it has been demonstrated through rigorous testing that these indicator lights are generally inaccurate, and may be illuminated even when the heating element is off.]
The thermostat does not present a problem for Yom Tov use, but makes it completely forbidden on Shabbos, according to most opinions. The outcome is that, ironically, the Sabbath Mode oven remains forbidden for Shabbos use, and is permitted only on Yom Tov. Perhaps it would have been more apt to name this feature “Yom Tov Mode”.
There is a practical workaround for Shabbos use that is easy and simple: Estimate about what time the main course will be served, and make sure that the oven turns off before then. This is generally easy to achieve, as the Sabbath Mode feature can usually be set to turn the oven off in any increment amount of time up until 72 or 96 hours. So, you can easily set the oven to go off after 2 or 3 hours, for example. Once the oven is off, opening the door does not create a problem with regards to the thermostat.
However, this method will usually create a new problem, which requires its own workaround. Now that the oven is off, this means that Sabbath Mode is now deactivated as well, and opening the door will turn the light on (if the oven has a light). This can be circumvented before Shabbos by manipulating the magnets or levers that detect whether the door is open. The specific manner of circumvention will vary from model to model, and in the case of magnetic detectors, may take some trial-and-error. Some oven doors are designed to be taken apart to allow proper cleaning of all the glass panes, and the magnet can be physically removed from the door. In other models, it may work to place a strong and thin magnet on the oven wall at the correct place.(The location of the oven’s magnet can usually be detected by sliding a paperclip around the top of the oven door.) These options may or may not work, depending on the model, so you would have to try before Shabbos, when you have the time and patience to troubleshoot it. [Note: Disabling the magnetic sensor only helps with regards to the functions controlled by the door sensor, such as the oven light and fans. However, the thermostat is not controlled by the door sensor, which is why the oven needs to be off before opening the door on Shabbos.]
Following the advice above, when Shabbos is followed by Yom Tov, one would have to choose whether to reserve the oven’s use for Shabbos or Yom Tov, as using it on Shabbos would require the oven to be set to turn off on Shabbos, in which case it will remain off for the duration of Yom Tov as well.
The Issur of Sheiyah with regards to an oven:
The above answer focuses purely on using the oven itself. However, there are also restrictions about which foods may be placed in an oven before Shabbos without a Blech, and much discussion about whether, and how, a Blech can be facilitated in an oven. Here is a brief summary of the issues:
From the Torah perspective, one may place food over an open flame before Shabbos in order that it cooks on Shabbos. Nevertheless, Chazal forbade this due to the concern that a person may come to stoke the fire on Shabbos in order to speed up the cooking process. This prohibition is knownas Shehiya.
One method of avoiding Shehiya is to cover the flames, typically with a Blech. Covering the fire indicates that one does not desire a strong flame, it diverts his attention from the fire, and it serves as a reminder not to increase the flames. With regards to an oven, there is a dispute whether – and how – a Blech can be adequately created. In practice, a Blech in an oven should be situated so that it covers the heating elements, which may be located either at the top of the oven, the bottom or the backwall. In many ovens, there are heating elements in all of these places.
Another way of addressing Shehiya, and to sidestep the need for a Blech, is to ensure that the food is cooked prior to Shabbos. It is sufficient if the food is already half cooked.  This fraction does not represent time, but rather, is qualitative and measured against the degree of cooking most people would regard as fully cooked. Nevertheless, for a number of reasons, it is best that the food be fully baked before Shabbos.
There is yet a third possible way to circumvent the prohibition of Shehiya. Chazal allowed one to put completely raw meat on an open flame just before the onset of Shabbos. They were not concerned that one might come to stoke the flames, because doing so would not serve any productive purpose – it would not ready the meat in time for the Friday night meal, nor would it be necessary to ready the meat in time for the Shabbos day meal. This leniency is known as “Kidra Chaysa” – literally: raw pot. (Indeed, some people may wish to put raw chicken and rice right before Shabbos to slow bake in the oven for the daytime Seudas Shabbos.)
In order for this leniency to apply, two criteria must be met. First, the food item must be one that takes a relatively long time to cook properly (such as meat). Second, the food must be put on the fire just before Shabbos, late enough that it will not begin cooking before Shabbos comes in. Some contemporary Poskim therefore assert that this leniency seldom applies nowadays, because most modern cooking appliances are able to cook in a relatively short amount of time. As a case in point, meat put up to cook rightat the  onset of Shabbos would usually be fit for consumption by the time the meat course  arrives. Even if the heat is set to low, this does not diminish the oven’s overall ability to bake quickly, because the seat heating can be easily raised. Thus, according to these Poskim, this option is not applicable to a modern oven.
Other associated issues:
1. It should be pointed out that even when the oven is off and cold, if it will be turned on with a Shabbos clock or a timer (see next point), one may not place inside any food which is not completely cooked. Furthermore, even completely cooked food that has cooled down may not be placed inside either, unless the food is completely dry (and will remain dry when heated). The same applies to an oven which will remain off but has  not yet cooled down.
2. With regards to Shabbos clocks in general, the Rebbe writes in a letter (Igros Kodesh Vol 12 page 192): “There are those who are extremely stringent and are even sceptical about the permissibility of using a Shabbos clock… Therefore, I am abstaining from giving this idea in an official capacity.” Even so, it is reported that the Rebbe instructed some individuals that they may be used (See Shulchan Menachem Volume 2 page 173).  At the same time, many authorities who permit Shabbos clocks in general nevertheless rule that they should not be used with regards to cooking specifically, for a number of reasons.

 In which tone should Shmoneh Esreh be recited?,"
Here is a quote from the Alter Rebbe’s Shulchan Aruch (OCH 101:2):
“One should not pray in his heart alone. Rather, he should articulate the words with his lips and whisper them audibly [the literal translation of the original would be: “make them heard by his ears”]. He should not, however, make his voice heard (by someone standing more than four cubits away), as it is written [regarding Chanh in I Shmuel 1:13] , “Only her lips were moving, but her voice was not heard.” A person who projects his voice during She­moneh Esreh is one of those whose faith is meager — as if the Holy One, blessed be He, would not hear a whispered prayer. (The Sages ordained that Shemoneh Esreh should be uttered in an absolute whisper, i.e., it should be heard by one’s own ears alone, so as not to embarrass transgressors who confess their sins when praying.)
Now, the Zoher and some Mekubalim (referenced in Likkutei Sichos vol. 35 in the Sicha (1) for Parshas Vayigash) hold that although one must verbalize his words, it should still be done completely quietly that even one himself shouldn’t hear himself. (This is because uncording to Kabbalah She­moneh Esreh is an expression of the highest level of Bittul where one’s entire being is completely nullified, thus his voice isn’t heard).
I have yet to find any reliable source which says that in this case we should follow the mekubalim, and there are Poskim (also brought by the Rebbe in that Sicha) who write that this instruction of the Arizal was a horoah l’yochid, and wasn’t directed to the public.
Therefore one should follow what is written in Shulchan Aruch.","###question

(The Sages ordained that Shemoneh Esreh should be uttered in an absolute whisper, i.e., it should be heard by one’s own ears alone, so as not to embarrass transgressors who confess their sins when praying.)
Now, the Zoher and some Mekubalim (referenced in Likkutei Sichos vol. 35 in the Sicha (1) for Parshas Vayigash) hold that although one must verbalize his words, it should still be done completely quietly that even one himself shouldn’t hear himself. (This is because uncording to Kabbalah She­moneh Esreh is an expression of the highest level of Bittul where one’s entire being is completely nullified, thus his voice isn’t heard).
I have yet to find any reliable source which says that in this case we should follow the mekubalim, and there are Poskim (also brought by the Rebbe in that Sicha) who write that this instruction of the Arizal was a horoah l’yochid, and wasn’t directed to the public.
Therefore one should follow what is written in Shulchan Aruch."
" Can a Sukkah be built under a screened enclosure?
Hi Rabbi Braun,
Someone moving to our community is looking into buying this house. They have a big sukkah and only place it will fit is in their backyard. The issue is that their whole backyard is screened. They want to know is they can build it under a screened enclosure.

Being that the screen is pasul for schach, that renders the area of schach directly under the screen invalid. One would therefore need to estimate that if one were to remove those areas of schach which is directly under each wire, whether the sukkah would still have more shade than sun.

 Are we allowed to take showers on a Three day Yom Tov?,"Firstly, the allowances given here to showering on Yom Tov is only when the following conditions are met:
a) One will assure not to run into the problem of  (squeezing) by their wet hair. That is to be careful from squeezing one’s hair from the washing till the drying. Therefore putting a soap or shampoo on the hair may not be done.
b) There is no allowance to use bar soaps since that is considered Me’machek (see Mishna Berurah 326:30). 
c) No fire can be lit or activated by turning on the shower faucet, therefore if the boiler was lit before Yom Tov that should help. However every case needs to be individually checked how the hot water system works in the shower.
Cold water shower on Yom Tov –
It is permissible to take a cold water shower (when fulfilling the conditions mentioned above) when a person is in great pain. See Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 326:1 & Alter Rebbe Shulchan Aruch ibid. The Alter Rebbe (ibid:6) concludes that it is the custom not to wash (bath in the outdoor lakes) even in cold water even when there is no prohibition attached to it. The Aruch Hashulchan (326:9) writes on this, “one who breaks this safeguard imposed by the Rishonim [custom of refraining from bathing in rivers, lakes and ponds] , on him it says ‘one who breaks the fence should be bitten by a snake’…”
With that said, the Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasa 14:11 (source is from Hagaos R. Akiva Eiger 326) brings that a person in pain may have a cold wash, the reasons is since if it is not in a lake, rather just a shower there are less concerns in Halacha.
One should not do this in a public setting like a mikvah. (People might not understand or think that one can also freely use hot water as well.) See Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 511:2.
Follow up Question on Showers on Yom Tov
Hot water shower on Yom Tov –
The Alter Rebbe (Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 511:1) after bringing a more lenient view, concludes that the custom follows like the view (Rema 511:2) that forbids one to wash his whole body in hot water that was heated on Yom Tov. This is since washing every day is not ו    (necessary for every person) and adds that even if it was heated before Yom Tov we still are to forbid the washing of the whole body by way of decree.
Today it is regular to shower daily, so some Poskim are lenient in extenuating circumstances (where cold water for some reason is not able to clean them) see Mishna Berurah (511:18) allows hot water even if it was heated on Yom Tov. However, as mentioned, the Alter Rebbe does not allow this. Therefore one can wash limb by limb in warm water. when the water is heated before Yom Tov. One should turn on the faucet to wash the face, hands and feet, and can keep the water on to continue washing the rest of the limbs. See Alter Rebbe ibid in the parenthesis.
Little children – 
As mentioned, the Alter Rebbe seems to be stringent (by way of custom even with little children who sometimes do not bathe every day), therefore it is best to wash a child limb by limb as mentioned above. If this is not possible, it seems that in extenuating circumstances for example the child could get bad rashes, one can rely on the Mishna Berurah (511:18) who allows to wash a child in hot water on Yom Tov. This would be if it is not possible to wash the little child limb by limb. The water would need to be heated before Yom Tov.","###question

 Is one allowed to eat food that was left in a basket underneath a stroller while the baby was sleeping?,"The Alter Rebbe writes (Hilchos Shemiras Guf V’Nefesh 7) that one should not place a cooked dish or other foods or drinks under a bed because of the ו  (evil spirit) then rests on them even if they are covered in an iron box.
With that said, there is room for leniency  (after the fact) with food left underneath a stroller while the baby is sleeping in it for the following reasons:
Some Poskim hold that the reason of the evil spirit resting on the food (underneath a bed) is only when the bed belongs to one who if they would touch food it would cause impurity to the food if they did not first do Netilas Yadaim. Since there is some leniency (after the fact) with the touching of little babies without Netilas Yadaim (see Alter Rebbe Orach Chayim Mehadura Basra Shulchan Aruch 4:2) to food, that rule would say the same here as well. (Note, that the Alter Rebbe in the parenthesis adds that it is proper to be stringent from the touching of a child from his Bris Milah.)
The Darkei Teshuva (Yoreh Deah 116:137) brings that the problem of placing food underneath a bed is only when it is only the floor beneath it literally  ’ ממ. This is not the case by a basket underneath a stroller.
The Darkei Teshuva ibid:138 brings the Sefer Mili Dichasidusa who holds that the problem of placing food under a bed is when there is marital relations on the bed.
Additionally, there are poskim that are always lenient in cases of bedieved.
Based on all these three reasons the Minchas Yitzchak (4:117) holds one can even be lenient even initially. However, it seems that based on the wording of the Alter Rebbe in both places (Shemiras Guf V’nefesh and Mehadura Basra) that one should be stringent at least initially.

"if the entire city has indeed a minhag/psak to daven before shkia, can Chabad have a different psak/minhag?
Please advise me."," 
There is a Machlokes HaPoskim if one may daven Mincha after Shkiah. The Alter Rebbe is of the position that we shouldn’t protest those who do daven after Shkiah. This doesn’t imply that it’s the right thing to do LeChatchillah.
Chassidim generally were very particular to ensure they finish Mincha before Shkiah. Notwithstanding the plethora of the Minyanim in 770, this is the right thing to do. There are unfortunately occasionally other minyanim in 770 which are not fully consistent with Zemanei Teffilah.
Even according to the position that one may daven after Shkiah, if faced with a choice of a Minyan after Shkiah or davening without a Minyan before Shkiah, some maintain that it’s better to daven B’Yechidus.
It is well known that the Rebbeim were so particular about this that they davened before Shkiah without a Minyan even when they had Yahrtzeit rather than davening after Shkiah. In the earlier years, the Rebbe did this several times too.
Certainly, in a place which has no such Minyanim this would be a breach of custom to introduce something like this, a matter which is highly questionable. There is a very simple solution to your situation: make it a habit of always coming on time to Shule. Your reluctance or difficulty to change your habit should not result in the community changing their standards and accommodating a behavior which is highly questionable.

" Is ripping toilet paper, not on the lines, permissible on Shabbos? If yes, why is it not under the Melacha of Korea? ","
One is not allowed to tear paper towels on shabbos, even not on the perforated line.
Regarding toilet paper, where no other other choice exists, one may rip the toilet paper, not on the perforated line.
It is recommended to rip the toilet paper with a Shinui. Ripping toilet paper with the left hand is not considered a Shinui.
This should not be relied on under ordinary circumstances; only where toilet paper was not prepared before Shabbos and it’s allowed only in order to preserve human dignity.
Reasoning:
The issue of ripping toilet paper isn’t a issue of Korea, since it’s one piece paper. Korea is a Melacha that only applies to items that are attached or sewn like clothes etc. there could be an issue of Mechatech, if it’s being ripped into a specific size. Even when not in a specific size there can be an issue – like in the above mentioned – of Tikun Kli, of fashioning an item for use. However, this can be permitted in a situation of K’vod HaBrios, specially if done with a Shinui – See below for an elaboration.

 Is there any reason why women don’t do Mayim Achronim?,"Strictly speaking, there is no difference between men and women. Nonetheless, the custom has developed that women are lenient in this matter.
The suggested explanation for the leniency among women is because nowadays washing Mayim Acharonim is considered as a Chumra and women haven’t taken it upon their self.
More specifically, there are generally three reasons for washing Mayim Acharonim:
A concern for a particular type of salt which when touches the eye can cause blindness.
Because the hands are dirty from food and one may not Bentch reciting Hashem’s name with dirty hands.
According to Kabalah, the purpose of Mayim Acharonim is to give the “other side” (evil forces) a small portion of the meal so that they don’t prosecute against us.
The Poskim mention that there are those who are not accustomed to wash because this type of salt is no longer common. As for the dirty hands, since nowadays people are not particular to wash their hands after meals, thus this wouldn’t be considered an obstacle to Benching. An additional explanation (mentioned specifically with regards to women) is that they are careful to eat with spoons and forks, and their hands do not touch the actual food. As for the Kabbalistic reason, women generally are not accustomed to follow Kabbalistic practices. Therefore, since washing Mayim Acharonim nowadays is considered an extra stringency women have not adopted this practice.
Of course, the above is only an explanation of an existing custom common among women. Clearly, if a woman knows her hands are dirty she may not Bentch without washing her hands first. Even absent the dirty hands, it is recommended – but not obligatory – that woman always wash Mayim Acharonim, without calling attention to her practice.","###question

Rav Braun, I am writing to ask if you can please clarify the issue of tub bathing and swimming on an Onas Prisha – both Onah Beinonis and the other Onos (Haflagah and Chodesh).
We have been taught that this is not permitted lechatchilla (nor is internal washing) and if the need is great to swim or bathe (in tub, not shower) that one should ask a Rav, which usually results in being told to do a bedikah prior to swimming or tub bathing on an Onas Prisha.
Iwas told that some poskim hold that if a woman did tub bathe or swim (water reachinginternally, which is unavoidable in such cases) on an onah beinonis, on her own, then she would have to start sheva nekiim over again. The Alter Rebbe does not hold this way, and if a woman did do this, she would not have to begin her count again.
We would like to confirm the issue. Namely, is a woman permitted to tub bathe and/or swim on an Onas Prisha, and in particular on the Onah Beinonis (or a kavuah) at all, or is a bedikah required beforehand, or nothing is required and it is not an issue.","

 If the cage is on a table, which is 10 tefachim high and 4×4 tefachim wide, as long as you cannot smell the smell from where you are, you may Daven and say Tehilim in the room.

There are certain poskim that are lenient because you started the treatment before Shabbos. According to this opinion it’s was certainly ok. But preferably one should avoid relying on this.
If the pain is strong that it causes a general weakness, one may take medication regardless. If there is great pain but it doesn’t cause a general weakness, it should be done with a shinui, with the left hand for example.
If you put just clean water, it’s not a issue and you don’t need a shinui.

" When should one get his hair cut before Shavuos this year, since Erev Shavuos is Shabbos?","It is a Mitzvah to have hair cut before every Yom Tov, so as not to enter into Yom Tov unkempt. The prohibition of haircutting on Chol Hamoed was instituted especially to compel people to receive a haircut prior to Yom Tov and not to postpone it.

After Chatzos, the time for Shacharis has passed and one may not daven Shacharis anymore (Musaf could still be davened).

" I didn’t see the moon (yet) tonight (Leil Yud daled). Tomorrow night I will be flying. What should I do if I see the moon on the plane, should I do it then or can I / should I push it off until the next night?","If you see the moon on the plane, you should do Kiddush Levana, and not risk the chance of missing Kiddush Levana altogether.
Explanation:
The Minhag is that Kiddush Levana is not performed under a roof (OC 426:4). There are two reasons for this Minhag:
According to the Bach (OC 426), it is disrespectful when one does not make the effort to leave one’s home and go out to greet the king; how much more so when greeting the Shechinah. [It might be argued that this reason does not apply when in an airplane, where it is impossible to “go out and greet the king”, and staying inside is therefore not an act of disrespect.]
According to the Maharil (cited in Magen Avraham OC 426:14), the concern is that there might be Tumah within the building, and it is appropriate that one should greet the Shechinah in a place which is Tahor.
In any case, the Bach rules that this Minhag applies only where practical. In cases where it is not practical to go outdoors, such as an (even mildly) ill person who is housebound, or someone who is frightened of the reactions of the Gentiles, may recite Kiddush Levana at the window. The Bach’s ruling is brought down by the Taz (OC 426:4) and Magen Avraham (ibid) and other Achronim. The Magen Avraham provides another (more obvious) example – when the outdoors is filthy and not befitting the Bracha.
There is a further discussion in the Poskim whether one may view the moon from behind a (transparent glass or plastic) windowpane. The Pri Megadim (Mishbetzos Zahav OC 426:4) rules that one may do so when it is not possible to open the window, such as in your situation. The Birchei Yosef (OC 426:4) seems to conclude that it is unnecessary to open the window at all. [This particular issue is a far-ranging one in Halacha, and also concerns vision through glasses, but the common practice is to be lenient in this matter, especially when the pane is completely transparent.]","###question

Permissible.
However, one must ensure not to violate the rules governing the interaction between men and women. This includes ensuring there is no Yichud, physical contact, flirtatious talk or behavior, excessive unnecessary conversation, and general lightheadedness.

Firstly, I should note that it is absolutely forbidden to do Melacha after sunset. As a measure of safety, one should always stop a bit before sunset.
If one has done Melacha after Shkiah, they need to undertake an appropriate Tikkun. They should discuss this with a Mashpia as well as putting measures in place to ensure this doesn’t happen ever again in the future.
Now to your questions about the individual:
It would be wrong to Passel (invalidate) a person without hearing his side and allowing him to respond to the accusations against him. Regardless, in this case, he isn’t considered a Mechalel Shabbos B’Farhesiya, his wine isn’t Yayin Nesech and he may be a Chazan.
It is strongly recommended to involve the rav or Mashpia of the shul in the matter.
If he indeed drives regularly after Shkiah even when told clearly, he should most likely not be relied upon in matters of kashrus. This would require determination from a local authority.

" A publication wants to print this letter and wants to know if you approve of it?
Do you approve of the following?
I recommend to consider that a couple getting married in their early twenties can expect to spend sixty years together, which is about five hundred thousand hours, and therefore should consider spending at least fifty hours getting to know their potential spouse before marrying them. Fifty hours is the equivalent of ten five hour dates and would only be one ten-thousandth of the time that they can expect to spend together. I think that it is obviously very unwise to marry someone without spending at least fifty hours getting to know them, and I recommend to go on at least ten five-hour dates before marrying someone.","
I don’t approve. Aside of the Hashkafah issues, there are some technical flaws in the logic here.
Couples don’t spend 24 hours a day together. That reduces your amount of hours significantly.
There is also no solid evidence that getting to know someone better, or for more time before marriage has bearing on the success rate of the marriage. Even if it does has bearing, as some argue, it’s obvious that serious commitment and shared goals are the ultimate influences on the durability of the marriage.
It should be noted that in many other circles they hardly see each other before marriage and they have a high success rate of lasting marriages. Historically, our ancestors who hardly dated also have a history of longer-lasting marriages.","###question

 May one interrupt while reading Shnayim Mikra?,"The Alter Rebbe (OC 285:6) states that some are accustomed to read the entire week’ s Shnayim Mikra without interruption at all, but that according to the basic Halacha, one may interrupt it and read “one Parsha today . . and another Parsha tomorrow”. [In this context, Parsha refers to a segment of Pesukim in the Torah that appears without any space between the Pesukim, also known as וו וומו.]
This implies that if one does not wish to read the entire week’s Shnayim Mikra at once, he may interrupt only when there is a break in the Torah between Parshiyos.
From this it can be inferred that:
1. It is ideal to read the entire week’s Shnayim Mikra without interruption at all.
2. It is acceptable to pause when there is a break in the Torah between Parshiyos.
3. One should not interrupt within a Parsha at all.
Although point 3 is only implicit in the Alter Rebbe, the Mishna Brura (Shaar Hatziyon 285:11) states this explicitly.

" Can my son work in a supermarket that has mostly non-kosher food?
There aren’t many summer jobs available for my young teenage son. Can he work in a supermarket where they have a nice kosher section, but it’s mostly non-kosher food? Are there certain jobs within such a place that are more or less desirable from a Torah perspective?","
It is difficult to answer you properly without knowing you or your son’s religiosity background. In general, a boy in Yeshiva should learn or work in an Orthodox Jewish camp (a boys camp and not mixed with girls). A boy in Yeshiva should continue to learn Torah throughout the summer.
In any case, according to strict Halacha, one is allowed to work in such a market provided that he is not preparing cooked non-kosher food.
Regarding selling non-kosher food, since the Jew does not own the food and does not prepare the food there are many Poskim who hold that the prohibition of selling certain non-kosher food does not apply. There is no concern of possibly eating the non-kosher food when one is working in a market (and not a restaurant) where most of the foods are completely closed and can only be consumed when leaving the store.
However, this is not advisable unless one is pressed desperately for money. The biggest concerns would be possible fraternizing with women, Jewish or  non-Jewish, and possible Yichud situations.
Therefore it is highly advisable to try to find some sort of job in a Jewish camp as a first choice. It would be advisable to also consult with one’s local Rabbi or Mashpia.","###question

" Is one who finds it harmful to eat dairy permitted to eat chicken during the Nine Days?
I saw in Kitzur Shulchon Aruch (122:8) that one who finds it harmful to eat dairy they are permitted to eat meat of a chicken. Is this accurate? If yes, am I permitted to eat chicken as I am highly allergic to all dairy products to the extent where I carry an EpiPen where ever I go, G-d forbid I need it.","
That is correct.
The reason for abstaining from meat during the Nine Days is twofold:
Because meat is associated with joy.
Because meat is reminiscent of the Korbonos which were halted at the time of the Churban.
These reasons don’t apply to the same degree with regards to chicken – it is not associated to the same degree with joy, and because chicken was not offered up as a Korbon.
Although the Minhag is to abstain from chicken nonetheless, and there is absolutely no leniency for a healthy person, the Bach (552:2) and Magen Avraham (551:28) are lenient for a person to whom dairy is harmful. This is because abstaining from all dairy and all meat for a period of nine days would have a detrimental health effect (Shvus Yaakov §36), and is therefore allowed when needed (Oruch Hashulchan 551:24).
The concern of a detrimental health effect certainly loomed large in times bygone when the range of available food was relatively minimal. Therefore, in our times, when there is a wide range of high protein foods, it would be appropriate to avoid poultry as well if you are absolutely certain that this will not lead to detrimental health effects.","###question

 What Brachah do I say when I see a River or an Ocean?,"Article: A Brachah on Rivers
The brachah of Oseh ma’aseh bereishis (thanking Hashem for the wonders of creation) should be recited when we see a large river that has been around since sheishes yemei breishis (the beginning of creation).
However, if the river has changed course, even if it happened biyedei shamayaim (due to a natural act from Above), we don’t say the brachah. When encountering a river, we needn’t be concerned that its course may have changed over time, but if it’s unknown whether the river dates back to sheishes yemei breishis, no brachah should be said. This is one of the reasons that this brachah is seldom recited, since the provenance of most rivers is unknown. Poskim say, though, that there is no concern with saying the brachah if we see very large rivers, such as the Mississippi.
None of the issues concerning rivers apply to oceans; we certainly should make a brachah when seeing an ocean. Upon seeing the “yam hagadol” (the ‘great ocean’), a special brachah, She’asah es (or Oseh) hayam hagadol, ought to be said. However, since we don’t know which ocean bears that name, we say Oseh maaseh breishis instead. Some maintain that the brachah for the yam hagadol should be recited when seeing any ocean which encircles continents, such as the Atlantic Ocean.
These Brachos are only recited once every 30 days.

" What should we do if we forgot to turn off the door chime from the alarm system before Shabbos?

Just came back from 10 days away. Don’t have enough clean clothing for the kids and myself. Don’t have enough towels. Can I do Landry?,"Can I also change linens for Shabbos this week?
Can I cut the kids’ nails for Shabbos on Friday?
Answers:
Children’s Clothing:
For little kids that soil their clothing frequently: Clothes may be washed during the nine days. Even for older kids, this year (5779) one may wash their clothing.
Adults clothing:
One should wash the stained area only. If necessary to wash all of it, then if one’s clothes are soiled due to sweat or other spills to the extent that one can not tolerate wearing them, one may wash them till the week of Tisha B’av. This year, where Tisha B’av falls out on Shabbos, if it can’t be washed through a non Jew there is room to be lenient the week before Tisha B’av.
Even in the week of Tisha B’av, if it is so soiled or full of sweat that one is embarrassed to go outside with them, or one considers it repulsive, then one may wash but only the bare minimum clothes necessary. They however should not be worn without putting them first on an earthen floor to remove the freshness. Better to have a non-Jew wash them.
During the week of Tisha B’av, undergarments should be bought rather than washed. Upper garments one should rather wash.
Towels: old towels should be reused. If the old towels are too dirty to use, and there are no alternatives, one may wash the towels.
Bed linens should not be changed on Shabbos Chazon unless they are too soiled to use.
Nails may be cut Erev Shabbos.","###question

 May I use water on Shabbos if the usage is being recorded by a digital meter?,"Digital water meters, which monitor and record water usage electronically, have become prevalent lately. Does this pose a problem on Shabbos, since it would seem that a digital form of writing takes place when one uses water?
Although those who don’t use these meters out of the desire to honor the sanctity of Shabbos tavo aleihem brachah (should be commended), the consensus among contemporary poskim is that digital water meters are not an issue due to a combination of factors, among them:
It’s not considered a typical form of writing, and at the very worst would be forbidden only m’d’rabanan (rabbinically).
The writing is the result of a grama, a secondary result merely caused by the primary, intended act.
It’s also koach kocho, not something obviously attributable to the original act of opening the faucet, but rather the result of a convoluted process many steps removed from that initial deed.
It’s a davar sheino miskaven—there is no intention of performing the melachah (forbidden act) of kosev (writing). It’s not considered a pesik reisha (an act with an inevitable outcome) which is forbidden even when inadvertent, since—in many digital meters— each individual usage isn’t recorded, and the meter only registers when a certain level of usage is reached. Thus, there is no certainty that any particular usage will trigger a digital recording. This is called a safek pesik reisha (it is doubtful whether the outcome is inevitable), and since it’s only a d’rabanan, one may be lenient.
It’s lo nichah leh—the person using the water has no desire that their use of water be recorded electronically. (Although it could be argued that one might actually want the usage to be recorded if the alternative is paying a higher fee, it still doesn’t mean that there’s a desire that it be recorded in this particular, forbidden manner).","###question

 Is it true that Minhag Chabad is to refrain from eating meat even after making a Siyum during the 9 days?,"I have not heard of such a Minhag as an official Chabad Minhag.
In Sefer Haminhagim it relates:
” מו” (מ”) ” ’ ו ו ומם ’ מם ן ” ’  ף   ו ״  ון.
In the English translation:
The Rebbe Rashab used to time the festive conclusion of his study of various Talmudic tractates to coincide with the Nine Days from Rosh Chodesh Menachem Av until Tishah BeAv. The meal that honored each such Siyum, however, included neither wine nor meat.
It’s possible that people understood from the translation as to say that the Rebbe Rashab was makpid that although he made a siyum he nevertheless did not eat meat. However, the simple understanding of the Hebrew text doesn’t imply that. Rather he made a siyum even though he had no intention of eating meat.
Furthermore, there are numerous times the Rebbe quoted this custom and on (at least) one occasion explained the basis for the custom.
In ו ו ”מ ” ם ’  the Rebbe says that the Rebbe Rashab needed for health reasons to eat chicken once every few days (including at least once in the nine days) and in order to eat chicken, he made a siyum on all of the nine days. The Rebbe then goes on to ask if the Rebbe Rashab only needed to eat chicken one day why did he have to make a siyum every day? The Rebbe answers because he didn’t want to use the Torah as something to use for his own physical benefit. In other words, he didn’t want to make a siyum in order to eat chicken – even if needed for health reasons. This way since he made a siyum every day it’s not noticeable that it was so he can eat chicken on that one day.
Also interesting to note from ו”מ ”  מ” (page 2648) where the Rebbe mentions
ומון ום ום מ – ום ו ו מו וו  וו ן. ו  ו מ מומו ו ומם ו ז ם ו מו    ו’.
Thus, there is no official minhag not to eat meat. At the same time, the purpose of the siyum is not in order to have meat. Nor was that the intention of the Rebbe’s horaah to make siyumim every day. Perhaps, that’s the reason why a custom developed not to serve meat at siyumim other than where necessary.
Additionally, when it comes to eating meat, there are certain restrictions as to what constitutes a siyum, and whether it’s permitted to schedule it deliberately for the nine days, as well as restrictions on who can attend a siyum with meat. For all these reasons, many are accustomed not to serve meat and such occasions.","###question

" When is the optimal time to put on Rabbeinu Tam Tefillin in a non-Chabad Rosh Chodesh Minyan that doesn’t take a break after U’va Letziyon?
If I’m behind, or if the minyan does not put Rabbeinu Tam (ashkenaz) can I first daven musaf with the minyan and then put Rabbeinu Tam tefillin?","
Our custom is to put on Rabbeinu Tam tefillin before musaf. If the minyan does not wait, one should make every effort to be able put on the tefillin earlier in davening. One should be careful not to remove tefillin shel rosh in the presence of a sefer Torah; they should turn and face the other way or do it under the tallis.
There is also an important idea of having the Rebeinu Tam on as soon as possible when taking off the Rashi Tefillin so that the blessing that was said on Rashi will count for Rebeinu Tam Tefillin (see Shulchan Aruch Admor Hazaken 34:5).
Additionally, based on Kabalah from the Arizal it is not ideal to put on Rebeinu Tam after davening Mussaf, (see Kaf Hachayim Orach Chayim 25:94-96)  since there is a level of Kedushas Musaf and it is no longer the time for Tefillin.
Question:
Could I go ahead of the minyan by saying ashrei and u’va l’tzion in the breaks between aliyos during krias haTorah which would give me time to put Rabbeinu Tam tefillin while the congregation would be saying ashrei and uva letzion or it is better to say ashrey and u’va l’tzion with the minyan to miss davening musaf with the minyan?
Answer: 
It’s better to say ashrei earlier so as not to miss musaf with a minyan. However, you the davener may decide what is best for yourself, (to go ahead of the minyan or not) in this specific case.
In any event, if one takes off his Tefillin before the Sefer Torah is returned to the Ark, he should not do so in the presence of the Sefer Torah, but should turn aside. This is so not to dishonor the Sefer Torah. (See Shulchan Aruch Admur Hazaken Orach Chayim 25:42).","###question

In any event, if one takes off his Tefillin before the Sefer Torah is returned to the Ark, he should not do so in the presence of the Sefer Torah, but should turn aside. This is so not to dishonor the Sefer Torah. (See Shulchan Aruch Admur Hazaken Orach Chayim 25:42)."
 On Mivtzoyim I go to someone who is right handed from birth but had an accident and cannot use his right hand (besides for opening and closing his fingers) so now he uses his left hand for all practical needs. Which hand should he lay the Tefillin on?,"He puts on his left hand.
There are those that say that in this situation he puts on right arm (מ״ ׳ ז ״  ם ו מ). However the (מ  (ו״ ׳  and  ו ׳  say that where ones arm   ך  will not heal then it is as if it doesn’t exist and he should therefore put it on his left arm.

 A not yet frum person is asking me about burial in a wall. Is this allowed? ,"There is a Halachic requirement to bury the deceased in the ground itself1.

He asserts that one who buries in a mausoleum violates a positive and negative commandment each day, in addition to the deplorable and unforgivable sin of bringing pain to the dead, for which repentance cannot help without seeking forgiveness from the dead, but for which there can be no reason why the dead should forgive. Reb Moshe concludes that even to merely be buried in a cemetery with such mausoleums is a disgrace and to be avoided.","###question

"Is it necessary to wait 6 hours after eating regular hard cheese like mozzarella, Munster, cheddar cheese, before eating fleishig?

Mozzarella and Munster cheeses – are soft cheeses and they are aged on average for 30 days. There is no need to wait six hours after eating them.

One may halachically use medical treatments even if it is based upon a pseudoscientific system and there is no convincing evidence that it it’s effective for medical conditions.

If I work as an energy healing (Reiki) practitioner, may I work on women?

It is not allowed to own a statue of a human being even if the intent is not for idolatry; the concern is chashad (suspicion).

We are doing renovations on our home. As far as leaving an area untouched as a Zecher L’Churban; what is the bare minimum that must be done in this regard? Size? Location? Can it be covered over or decorated in any way?,"There is a halachah in Shulchan Aruch that there should be a zecher l’churban at every joyous occasion in one’s life.
One application of this halachah is that when one is building or renovating a house or apartment they should leave an unfinished area measuring an amah by an amah (approx. 1.5 ft x 1.5 ft) which can be seen right when one walks into the house; this area should not be newly plastered, painted, nor wallpapered.
There are some poskim who are lenient and say that the unplastered area may be covered, and others who say it may not. Some say that this should be done in every room of the house, but the consensus among poskim is that leaving an unfinished area near the entrance is sufficient.
If one buys a house or apartment from a non-Jew they need not do so—unless they are putting up new walls. Even if one buys from a Jew, but if the previous Jewish homeowner acquired it from a non-Jew, it does not need to be done either, since initially there was no obligation to do so. However, this is the case only if the residence was not gutted nor the walls replaced from the time that the first Jew bought it; this is one of the reasons many people are lenient regarding this halachah. However, if the Jewish owner is repainting the home or apartment they should leave an amah by an amah unpainted where it can be seen upon entering.","###question

 Am I allowed to eat in a married woman’s kitchen if she does not cover her hair?,"This depends on various factors. Firstly, do you know if she keeps the basic kosher standards that are not necessarily kept by all kosher consumers such as: Cholov Yisrael and Pas Yisrael, etc..? In other words, what is her official standards?
Is she knowledgeable and active in checking salads for bugs? Does she check eggs for blood spots? Does she understand that there are many hechsherim and not all of them are acceptable to Anash?
If it seems to you that her knowledge seems adequate to run a kosher kitchen to your liking, then we need to consider the second question: can you rely on her Yiras Shamayim due to the fact that she does not cover her hair?
This would depend on her upbringing. For example, if she is only starting to become frum the reason for not covering her hair might be because she knows that many Orthodox women do not cover their hair and she considers herself like one of them, (of course this is wrong, but it is her nisayon – challenge). If so, it could be acceptable to eat in her home if otherwise, her Yiras shamayim seems to be good in all other aspects.
If, however, she has had a frum upbringing and now does not cover her hair, then this is a negative reflection on her yiras shamayim. This is since there is no true justified reason she can have that she is not covering her hair.
Therefore, the matter would depend on your kosher standards and the specifics of some of the above-mentioned points to consider.","###question

 Do stockings for women’s legwear need to be opaque?,"Questions:
1. Must a woman’s stockings be opaque (I.e. the leg isn’t seen through the stockings)?
2. Is it permissible to wear stockings which cover the leg completely (no holes), are somewhat sheer (can see the leg through hosiery) but are visibly not the woman’s leg (I.e. there is a seam or design, or the color is darker than the leg/black)
Answers:
The area below the knee is considered the Shok and thus is an Ervah and therefore must be covered. The denier of the stockings should be such that it is impossible to see the legs through the stockings. Yet, it need not conceal the shape of the leg. Some suggest the number 40 and others suggest higher numbers.
There are many women who are accustomed to wearing stockings of a lesser denier. While this goes against the straightforward understanding of the halacha, there is some room within halacha to defend those do so, as long as it blurs the image of the leg.

"I’m due for a baby a couple days after Rosh Hashanah. I usually run late.

Once active labor has begun you should drink regularly – not small amounts at a time (Shiurim) – to ensure you have enough fluid in your body. Discuss with your doctor whether eating is recommended.
Active labor is defined when contractions are regular and less than five minutes apart, you feel you cannot walk, ready to push, or the water has broken.
Showering is also permitted at this stage.

" What Brocha do we make on Corn Flakes?
Is there a difference between Kemach or Taanug companies?","
It depends whether the corn flakes are made from actual corn pieces or from corn flour. The bracha on flakes from pieces, otherwise known as grits, is Haadama. To the best of our knowledge, Kellogg’s cornflakes are made this way. However, the bracha on cornflakes made from ground corn, corn flour, is Shehakol. Many popular cornflakes made by frum companies are made this way.","###question

" Anxiety and Depression: Lack of Emunah or a Clinical Condition?

 Is an oven with Sabbath Mode truly acceptable for Shabbos use?,"There are many ovens on the market, and it is impossible in this short space to investigate and address every single model. The best we can do is provide a summary of the many issues to look out for. It is important that you read through the manuals of any model you are considering for purchase, in order to determine whether, and to what degree, the issues outlined below apply.
Modern ovens without “Sabbath Mode”:
First, let us focus on modern ovens which do not have a Sabbath Mode feature. Such ovens are challenging to use for Shabbos and Yom Tov, for a number of reasons. The main problem with using them on Shabbos is the thermostat, which is affected by opening or closing the oven. When the oven door is opened, the thermostat will detect the cold air that rushes in and will activate the heating element if it is off at that moment. It is forbidden to cause this to occur, even if all the food will be removed all at once before the oven door is re-closed. [If the oven door is re-closed with some of the food remaining inside, there may be additional concerns of Bishul on Shabbos, depending on the circumstances.]
The thermostat is not a concern for Yom Tov use, but the problem with using such an oven on Yom Tov is primarily a practical one; most modern ovens have an auto shut-off feature that turns the oven off after around 6-12 hours. Yet another problem, applicable on both Shabbos and Yom Tov, is that many models have lights or fans that are activated and deactivated as the door is opened or closed. In summary, a modern oven without Sabbath Mode may be completely unusable on Shabbos and Yom Tov.
Ovens with “Sabbath Mode”:
Buying an oven with Sabbath Mode will alleviate many of these problems. Sabbath Mode will generally disable the oven’s display panel and any electronic controls, as well as disengage the fans and lights from being activated by opening and closing the oven door. The Sabbath Mode feature will also disable the auto shut-off feature. However, one very big problem, at least with regards to most models, is that the thermostat usually remains operative. [Some ovens have a light which illuminates when the heating element is on, in which case the oven could theoretically be opened when the light is on. However, it has been demonstrated through rigorous testing that these indicator lights are generally inaccurate, and may be illuminated even when the heating element is off.]
The thermostat does not present a problem for Yom Tov use, but makes it completely forbidden on Shabbos, according to most opinions. The outcome is that, ironically, the Sabbath Mode oven remains forbidden for Shabbos use, and is permitted only on Yom Tov. Perhaps it would have been more apt to name this feature “Yom Tov Mode”.
There is a practical workaround for Shabbos use that is easy and simple: Estimate about what time the main course will be served, and make sure that the oven turns off before then. This is generally easy to achieve, as the Sabbath Mode feature can usually be set to turn the oven off in any increment amount of time up until 72 or 96 hours. So, you can easily set the oven to go off after 2 or 3 hours, for example. Once the oven is off, opening the door does not create a problem with regards to the thermostat.
However, this method will usually create a new problem, which requires its own workaround. Now that the oven is off, this means that Sabbath Mode is now deactivated as well, and opening the door will turn the light on (if the oven has a light). This can be circumvented before Shabbos by manipulating the magnets or levers that detect whether the door is open. The specific manner of circumvention will vary from model to model, and in the case of magnetic detectors, may take some trial-and-error. Some oven doors are designed to be taken apart to allow proper cleaning of all the glass panes, and the magnet can be physically removed from the door. In other models, it may work to place a strong and thin magnet on the oven wall at the correct place. (The location of the oven’s magnet can usually be detected by sliding a paperclip around the top of the oven door.) These options may or may not work, depending on the model, so you would have to try before Shabbos, when you have the time and patience to troubleshoot it. [Note: Disabling the magnetic sensor only helps with regards to the functions controlled by the door sensor, such as the oven light and fans. However, the thermostat is not controlled by the door sensor, which is why the oven needs to be off before opening the door on Shabbos.]
Following the advice above, when Shabbos is followed by Yom Tov, one would have to choose whether to reserve the oven’s use for Shabbos or Yom Tov, as using it on Shabbos would require the oven to be set to turn off on Shabbos, in which case it will remain off for the duration of Yom Tov as well.
The Issur of Shehiya with regards to an oven:
The above answer focuses purely on using the oven itself. However, there are also restrictions about which foods may be placed in an oven before Shabbos without a Blech, and much discussion about whether, and how, a Blech can be facilitated in an oven. Here is a brief summary of the issues:
From the Torah perspective, one may place food over an open flame before Shabbos in order that it cooks on Shabbos. Nevertheless, Chazal forbade this due to the concern that a person may come to stoke the fire on Shabbos in order to speed up the cooking process. This prohibition is known as Shehiya.
One method of avoiding Shehiya is to cover the flames, typically with a Blech. Covering the fire indicates that one does not desire a strong flame, it diverts his attention from the fire, and it serves as a reminder not to increase the flames. With regards to an oven, there is a dispute whether – and how – a Blech can be adequately created. In practice, a Blech in an oven should be situated so that it covers the heating elements, which may be located either at the top of the oven, the bottom or the back-wall. In many ovens, there are heating elements in all of these places.
Another way of addressing Shehiya, and to sidestep the need for a Blech, is to ensure that the food is cooked prior to Shabbos. It is sufficient if the food is already half cooked.  This fraction does not represent time, but rather, is qualitative and measured against the degree of cooking most people would regard as fully cooked. Nevertheless, for a number of reasons, it is best that the food be fully baked before Shabbos.
There is yet a third possible way to circumvent the prohibition of Shehiya. Chazal allowed one to put completely raw meat on an open flame just before the onset of Shabbos. They were not concerned that one might come to stoke the flames, because doing so would not serve any productive purpose – it would not ready the meat in time for the Friday night meal, nor would it be necessary to ready the meat in time for the Shabbos day meal. This leniency is known as “Kidra Chaysa” – literally: raw pot. (Indeed, some people may wish to put raw chicken and rice right before Shabbos to slow bake in the oven for the daytime Seudas Shabbos.)
In order for this leniency to apply, two criteria must be met. First, the food item must be one that takes a relatively long time to cook properly (such as meat). Second, the food must be put on the fire just before Shabbos, late enough that it will not begin cooking before Shabbos comes in. Some contemporary Poskim therefore assert that this leniency seldom applies nowadays, because most modern cooking appliances are able to cook in a relatively short amount of time. As a case in point, meat put up to cook right at the onset of Shabbos would usually be fit for consumption by the time the meat course  arrives. Even if the heat is set to low, this does not diminish the oven’s overall ability to bake quickly, because the seat heating can be easily raised. Thus, according to these Poskim, this option is not applicable to a modern oven.
Other associated issues:
1. It should be pointed out that even when the oven is off and cold, if it will be turned on with a Shabbos clock or a timer (see next point), one may not place inside any food which is not completely cooked. Furthermore, even completely cooked food that has cooled down may not be placed inside either, unless the food is completely dry (and will remain dry when heated). The same applies to an oven which will remain off but has  not yet cooled down.
2. With regards to Shabbos clocks in general, the Rebbe writes in a letter (Igros Kodesh Vol 12 page 192): “There are those who are extremely stringent and are even skeptical about the permissibility of using a Shabbos clock… Therefore, I am abstaining from giving this idea in an official capacity.” Even so, it is reported that the Rebbe instructed some individuals that they may be used (See Shulchan Menachem Volume 2 page 173). At the same time, many authorities who permit Shabbos clocks in general nevertheless rule that they should not be used with regards to cooking specifically, for a number of reasons.

"I have a Sefer Torah in Chabad house in a portable dresser/closet. What is the minhag in general regarding how many coverings and how to cover it?

The custom is to have a curtain always covering the Aron Kodesh’s door. This is not only to beautify the Aron Kodesh but a sign of modesty. This is based on the verse (Terumah 26:33) “… The partition shall separate for you between the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies.” An additional reason is that the curtains are a cover over the aron, as was done in the midbar that the Klei Hakodesh (holy vessels) were covered. (See Bamidbar 4: 5 onwards).

"I have been following a candidate diet which helps rid the body yeast. This is due to years of suffering from symptoms that I’ve only just identified as likely yeast overgrowth in my body. On the diet you’re not allowed to have any sugar (or anything that your body converts to sugar) or any yeast. My question is about Kiddush and hamoitzi on shabbos. I don’t want to have wine and challah being that any bit of sugar or yeast can feed the yeast in my body, causing them to getting again before they can die off and set the diet back to start. Therefore I want to know if I can I skip the wine and challah on shabbos until I’ve rid myself off the yeast problem?","
Firstly, it is important to differentiate between if this is a question which touches   (slightest chance of mortal danger) or ו ן ו  (illness that temporarily incapacitates). If this is touches the first category, you are certainly exempt from having Challah and wine on Shabbos.
If this is touching only the second category or מו (minor discomfort) then the following applies:
Wine:
Practically speaking, it would be best to have someone else recite Kiddush and you will listen and you do not need to drink the wine (Shulchan Aruch Admor Hazaken Orach Chayim 272:12).
Challah:
Eating Challah at kiddush is an obligation for Kiddush on wine needs to be in place of a Seudah. The main Seudah is considered Lechem (bread). The bread needs to be of the type one would recite מו and  מזון on it. (Shulchan Aruch Admor Hazaken Orach Chayim 274:5).
If it is very difficult, one can suffice with eating only one Kazayis of bread. (Shulchan Aruch Admor Hazaken Orach Chayim 274:6.) In this case, no bracha is made when washing.
There is the view of the  מ” מן  (the Alter Rebbe’s brother) who testified that the Alter Rebbe in the end of his life changed his earlier ruling and said that one fulfills the obligation of “Seudah” for Shabbos also with Mezonos.
If the above is also too hard to do, you may rely on the following:
Hear kiddush from someone else and drink reviis wine for mokom seuda. If that’s not possible either – eat something filling in following priority order (dates, meat or fish). You may rely on the opinion that holds that mokom seuda of the one making kiddush is sufficient in addition to the opinion that holds that anything filling is considered mokom seuda.
For lechem mishnah: hear from someone else lechem mishnah and eat yourself a tiny piece. For less than a Kazayis, one does not bentch. (Shulchan Aruch Admor Hazaken Chayim 184:2).
You may rely on those that say lechem Mishnah is on one family member as well as the opinion that holds that less than kezayis is enough. In addition you will be filling yourself with other foods as mentioned before.","###question

"Since I learned that Mitzvos need kavana (and I know it should take quick, but) since I’m afraid not to have it, so I decided to just say the words in my mind “I want to fulfill the Mitzva “X””. But still, since I’m afraid I’m not able to concentrate and keep saying it over and over, could I just say it once and no matter if I had proper concentration or not move on?","Response:
I am sorry to hear about your condition and I’m sure that you are seeking medical help, and I’m glad to offer halachic help.
Someone who suffers from an ailment, physical or mental, must do all they can to be healed, at times even at the expense of violating a positive Mitzva. The Rebbe is of the opinion (as are mental health professionals lehavdil), that part of the treatment for OCD is to never repeat anything, and that this has priority over your obligation of Mitzvos. In simple words: to repeat any part of a Mitzva, even it’s kavana, is detrimental to your mental health and should not be done. This would be the halacha even if it would mean not fulfilling a Mitzva. But as I’ll explain soon, you did in fact fulfill your Mitzva obligation.
Regarding kavana specifically – I think the solution that you have (to verbalize your kavana) is a great one! Halacha states that if one has an initial intention to fulfill a Mitzva during its preparation, that intention is effective even hours later when he actually does the Mitzva, even though he does not have specific intention at the moment. How much more so when you are having the intention right before fulfilling the Mitzva. The effectiveness is strengthened when the intention is verbalized. For then it is effective even if someone might have opposite thoughts!
From the above it is clear that once you have kavana to fulfill the Mitzva, and especially if you verbalize it, there is nothing to be worried about. And neither the kavana nor the verbalization should be repeated.

 Can an electric cooktop be used on Yom Tov?,"
On Shabbos, we are forbidden from raising/lowering a fire. Chazal said that one must cover the fire – and according to some poskim, the knobs too – in case one might forget and raise the fire over Shabbos.
On Yom Tov however we are permitted to raise a (real, not electric) fire, but we may not extinguish it or lower it, and therefore this halacha does not apply for Yom Tov. However, it is still forbidden to actually raise/lower an electric appliance.
Therefore you may use an electric appliance without worry about the knobs/buttons, just make sure not to actually use the knobs/buttons.","###question

" I do not live so close to a shule. The only nearby shule uses a “Shabbos” microphone. Is there a halachic problem with such a microphone on Shabbos?
AskTheRav:
There are details missing here. What type of shul is this that uses a “Shabbos microphone”?
What are their mechitzah standards and other religious standards?
User:
Thank you for your reply:
The shule is Orthodox, as is the rabbi. Many (if not almost all) are not yet Shomrei Shabbos.
The mechitzah is 40”.
The microphone is tzomet.
The rabbi is willing to let us make a separate minyan in our own room.
So the question is:
Could I join the main minyan, based on the microphone/mechitza?
Could we use the facility to make a separate minyan?","
The accepted normative standard for a mechitzah is that it be at least 6 feet (72″) tall. This is the mainstream accepted halacha as well as the standards instructed by the Rebbe.
The same applies with regard to using a microphone on Shabbos. Virtually all poskim have forbidden this, whether due to halachic concerns of Chilul Shabbos (havarah, boneh, makeh b’patish, klei shir, etc.), or the halacha of avsha milsa (in contrast to chiming clocks which are set usually in advance and therefore permitted, mics are not normally set in advance and create an issue of avsha milsa).
Others mention that one cannot be yotze Kedusha or chazaras hashatz this way. Moreover, even during the week, it is a major issue as it an imitation of the Reform. Even though the microphone has a practical purpose to be able to gear the Chazan, we find that Poskim forbade moving the Mechitza to the front, for this very reason, even when done for practical convenience. Indeed, Poskim such as the Chasam Sofer and others have forbidden bringing a musical organ into the shule for this reason). Even if the “Shabbos microphone” would be “halachically kosher”, it could lead to other breaches in halacha, as we see that there is a great  in this matter of “modernization in Synagogues”. Most Gedolei Gisroel have not accepted the heter of a “Shabbos microphone” even with all the special conditions. See at length ום ן , . 
It is however permissible to daven in a side room in the Synagogue (in a fully kosher fashion) provided that it is clear that this minyan is a separate entity from the big minyan and that it will not be associated with the “quasi orthodox minyan”, and it should not be interpreted as giving a “hechsher” to the big minyan.  ו״ ״מ ו״ , מ. Since is likely that if you are short of a minyan, some of the daveners will go into the big minyan which is not up to par, it would be better to pray somewhere else until things improve in the Halachik standards of the shul. However, there is room to be lenient in a side room as outlined above.","###question

"I know the minhag of many is Not to make kiddush between six and seven. This was what I remember my custom in my parents home. My question is, sometime this leads to stress in the house either rushing through Sholom Aleichim to get on time and rushing from shul home. On the other hand we have a house of young children at home and waiting till seven can lead to chaos some times. Kids are impatient and hungry. In addition we have guests and this can add pressure. Is there room to be maikel on this custom?","
Although this minhag is brought in the Alter Rebbe’s Shulchan Aruch (271:3), it is a minhag and not a Din. Chazal teach us that great is peace, for the whole Torah was given only to make peace in the world. Accordingly, the mitzva of sholom overrides this minhag. Furthermore, we find that Shalom Bayis outweighs the entire mitzvah of kiddush, for, according to halacha, if one cannot afford both Shabbos candles and wine for kiddush, he should buy only candles since they are there for the purpose of Shalom Bayis.
At the same time, It is highly recommended that one do their best to explain to family members that this is our minhag and the significance of observing minhagim, especially a minhag mentioned in Poskim. In fact, some consider this an issue of potential sakanah which is often deemed more serious than matters of issur. Generally speaking, observing Torah customs bring about more peace and stability in the home and shouldn’t cause conflict. The conflict usually stems from an inadequate presentation and packaging of the issue. If the family perceives the significance of this issue, they would fully appreciate your behavior.
Obviously, if despite all attempts to present things in the proper manner it still appears to cause stress or tension, or if it affects the atmosphere in the house (,), then one definitely should not wait.
When Kiddush is made within the hour wait time it should be made immediately upon arrival home from shul, with as least delay as possible.
Alternatively one may make kiddush before going to shul, even before dark. Although this is not the usual Lubavitch minhag, it is preferable than making Kiddush during the hour.
Guests – the Rebbe writes that this minhag applies even in the event of guests, since it is a sakana issue. However it is still restricted to what I wrote above.
Children – children do not need to wait for kiddush to eat, not even for chinuch. Most likely the situation can be ameliorated somewhat if they are given something to eat until kiddush is made. In fact, if they are hungry one is not allowed to stop them from eating.","###question

 Why don’t we say Kaddish in Hebrew so that it is more easily understood? ,"The saying of Kaddish in general and by a mourner, in particular, has great significance in Halacha and more so in Kabbala, which is beyond the scope of this answer. Nevertheless, I will give a brief explanation to answer your question:

" A home, with a full Kosher kitchen, had Goyim working there as home attendants during a span of several years. Do all the dishes need to be Kasherd?
A home had goyim and not observant yidden working there as home attendants (one at a time) throughout the day and night during a span of several years.
In this home, there was a kosher kitchen with multiple cabinets and closets of many pots, pans, utensils, etc. In addition to the workers’ being instructed not to touch any dishes, throughout the years of this situation, there were always family members coming in and out at random hours of day and night checking up (although there may have been some shifts/days during which no family members came, but they were never informed if/when family would show up). Sometimes residing extremely close by.
In more recent times, there were also cameras installed. Despite that, there were several times (not many) which certain workers (of which there were various, different years brought different ones, but only one at a time) were caught using a utensil or about to use one. It remains unknown if there many other such instances in which they weren’t caught. Though it would have possibly been noticed if a utensil was left out.
Please note that they weren’t authorized to cook and so there was no cooking taking place. There was a kettle which they used to make hot drinks for the kosher patient and perhaps for their own food. But they weren’t usually seen eating hot food, so I’d assume they mostly dealt with cold. There are hundreds of utensils in this kitchen (not any unusual quantity, but a typical accumulation of a classic kosher kitchen). It is extremely unlikely that the vast majority of them were ever used by these workers.
The question now is the status of everything in the kitchen (the situation is no longer ongoing). Are the dishes all batul berov? Also, some of the cabinets/drawers looked like they were never handled though we can never know with certainty. The point being, if there was contact, some areas were more likely to have been accessed than others – if that’s a factor. Do they still need kashering? There are sets of china (and other utensils of non-kasherable material) as well.
Please advise your opinion on the matter. Sources would be appreciated. Thanks a lot!","

" Does Ma’aser need to be given on cash rewards/miles/points earned through your credit card?
The only way you can earn them is through spending money, is it considered earned money?","
Miles:
If you can only use the points for very specific items you need not give maaser. However, if it gives you a broad purchasing power through your credit card it’s considered as a monetary gift and maaser must be given.
If it can only be used as miles (and the miles are not being exchanged for cash) or to reduce your credit card debt, maaser need not be given.
Ma’aser need not be separated from miles earned on a flight even if exchanged for cash, as it’s considered a rebate on the ticket.
Cashback:
One need not separate maaser from rebates, even if they are cash back rebates.
Points:
There are those who wish to make a distinction between various types of credit card points as follows: Credit card points received for purchases, whether per dollar or after reaching a certain threshold (say, $1000 within a specific time frame) would, in their opinion, be considered similar to a rebate. However, points that are received for referrals or sign-up bonuses for new accounts (if they’re not attached to spending a specific amount within a specified time frame) are deemed as income. Though it’s hard to justify this line of reasoning -see Hebrew references below- there is room to allow those who follow this opinion to continue doing so.","###question

Although there is no alternative to baked goods from the 5 grains, you must still have “mokom seuda” in order to be yotze kiddush. This can be done by drinking an additional reviis of grape juice after kiddush. If this is too difficult you can be yotze with the reviis of kiddush. Obviously, whoever is not making kiddush will need to have their own reviis of grape juice for “mokom seuda“.","###question 
 Me and my wife are starting a diet that eliminates all potential foods that can cause allergies, sensitivities, inflammations for 30 days. Among other things, we can’t consume alcohol, added sugar or any grains. I could see myself doing Kiddush on natural grape juice but I can’t think of what I can do regarding Chala. Any provisions or heters for 4 weeks?.
 ###answer 
 
Kiddush – order of preference: 
Hear kiddush from someone else and be yotze even without drinking.
Make kiddush yourself on grape juice and drink it.
Make kiddush on wine and have someone else drink it.

" Is the kiddushin valid if one was too overwhelmed and didn’t have kavana while saying “harei at mekudeshes”?

Many Chasanim feel overwhelmed during the Chupa because of excitement, nervousness, and because of the holiness and life change which is taking place. It may be hard to remember now if you had kavana, but that does not in any way disqualify the kiddushin. So long as you were in a general good state of mind, there is nothing to be worried about.

"My wife had a shorter veses haflaga kavua. She has now established a longer veses haflaga kavua without three consecutive clean occasions at the shorter veses. What is the current status for the shorter veses kavua? Does she need to keep both, or just the longer? If just the longer, under what circumstances will the shorter resurrect?

The basic point is that she first saw after 49 clean periods, and never had an opportunity to take that off the calendar because she always saw before then.

However, on 18 Tammuz in the day, she saw again after 49 periods, so that made two times for after 49 clean periods. in the next two months (Av and Elul) she saw after 47 clean periods, even earlier than the 48 veses kavua. In Tishrei she saw even earlier after 45 periods. Then in Cheshvon, she saw again after 49 periods, for the third time at after 49 periods.

 Is it permissible to go paintball shooting?,"It is important to point out that if this is regarding a camp activity, then whatever written further below has no bearing on what should be done in camp. The purpose of this answer is not for staff members – in contrast to the director – to take this answer and make a Balagan in camp with it. The camp has their Rav who they ask their Shailos to, and that is what is to be followed in the camp B’Poel Mamosh. 
According to Halacha, one should not hit oneself nor shall he hit anyone else even if he gives permission, for it is not his body to give permission to hurt (and an Issur D’Oraysa might be involved).
Some Rabbonim permit paintball shooting as a school or camp activity to encourage learning and/or proper behavior (i.e. as a trip for for good learning) – similar to the concept of hitting a child to help his learning.
Others argue that it is only Assur to hurt someone if done in a harmful manner, however, since paintball shooting is done in a friendly manner there is no Issur involved. Nonetheless, this Heter should only be used if it is L’Toieles.
Indeed, tackle football is regularly played in many otherwise religious schools and camps. However, there is an obvious distinction since here there are guns used for shooting and hurting, while tackling is not officially to attack.
While these arguments might justify the Minhag to be lenient, there is strong room to adopt a stringent approach, as per the straightforward reading of Halacha (referenced below).
I would add that if we don’t steal the Afikoman, which is a Minhag because it involved stealing, even though it’s only a game, we definitely shouldn’t shoot other Yidden and hurt them, even as a game. It appears to be very against our Shito. As mentioned, camps must formulate a policy with their local Rav on this matter.

" What is the minimum of Challah one can eat and still be able to wash & Bentch?
I try to keep the minhag of melave malka every week, including washing. Sometimes it’s hard to eat a lot after having eaten recently at the Shabbos meal…
What is the minimum of challah/Matzah one can eat and still be able to wash/bentch?
Over the years I’ve seen many different places where there is a weight amount or, worse yet, a description such as “kazayis” or “kabeitza” to describe food shiurim, and those leave a person very confused as to the exact amount of food. Would the Rav be so kind as to describe the size of a piece of challah or the amount of matzah (usually box Square Matzah)? (E.g. The amount of challah comparable to a golf ball or two golf balls etc or a different item that the challah could be measured against).
Additionally, does the shiur consist of only the hamotzi food, or could something that’s put on top of the challah/matzah also count as part of the shiur? (Let’s say if someone puts egg salad or tuna salad on challah, can this be counted and this way one eats let’s of the actual hamotzi food but can nevertheless still wash and bench).
And finally, is there a time frame in which one needs to eat the shiur?","
One must wash (without a Bracha) and make Hamotzi for even the smallest amount.
One must wash with a Bracha if he’s planning on eating a K’beitza. This is approximately 2 K’zeizim. Each K’zayis should be eaten within K’dei Achilas Pras (= 4 minutes) and without pausing between the two of them.
One must make a Birchas Hamazon if he ate a K’zayis of bread within 4 minutes. Other foods do not count for this amount.
If 4 minutes proves to be too difficult, one can be lenient and eat it within 6 minutes but should eat approximately the size of 1/3 of a K’beitza within 4 minutes. If one is not sure if it was eaten in the right amount of time – if he is satiated, he should still make a Birchas Hamazon.
Torah measurements are usually volume-based, not weight. A K’zayis is the approximate volume of half an average size egg. A K’beizah is the volume of an average size egg. Nonetheless, for simplicity, they have been converted to weight measurements, although the weight measurements are far from accurate. This is because different foods with an equal volume weigh differently. The following is the weight for water; bread and certainly matzah weighs less. For a K’beitza this is approx. 53.8 gram or 1.89 oz. For a K’zayis, approx. 25.6 gram or 0.90 oz.
One-third of a standard square machine matza is approximately a K’zayis. With bread, it is harder to measure, as they are not uniform but it is approximately the size of what would fit into a small l’chaim cup. In order to be safe, one should err on the side of caution and eat slightly more than the shiur, due to a number of reasons, among them since some crumbs remain between the teeth.

 Why are men not allowed to wear jewelry?,"In a place where it is common that men, including religious men, wear rings there isn’t really an issue. However, in a place where men do not wear rings, this can be a serious concern of lo yilbash, a Torah violation of dressing with female ornaments.
Additionally, one must always take into account the local custom; one may never breach what is locally acceptable. At times, violation of local mores can be as severe as breaking Torah law.
An additional issue is the prohibition of chukos hagoyim. This includes any non-Jewish mode of behavior which has no ta’am (logical basis) or to’eles (obvious benefit)—and when a Jew performs them they are acting solely to imitate what is in vogue. Even behaviors which have an appreciable rhyme or reason, if it’s a conduct that is derech pritzus, shachatz v’gaavah ([an aspect of] immodesty or pretentiousness) is forbidden; the Toras Kohanim also includes elegant dress associated with the non-Jewish elite.
According to one interpretation, it includes any mode of conduct that was initiated by non-Jews and gained widespread popularity before Jews adopted this behavior.
Even when none of these issues are present, we want to seriously consider why they wish to wear jewelry and whether this stems from a place of kedusha, or this is simply the desire of nefesh habahamis; she uses even matters that are permissible to lure one in her net.

" Should one set up advanced security measures in their Chabad house?
Should one set up advanced security measures (guards, weapons, training, etc.) in their shul/Chabad house? Included in this question: there is already a Mezuzah. Why doesn’t that offer enough protection? And if it does, why would one need to take such measures?","
I’ll start off with an anecdote:
A man was stuck on his rooftop in a flood. He was praying to G-d for help.
Soon a man in a rowboat came by and the fellow shouted to the man on the roof, “jump in, I can save you.” The stranded man shouted back, “no, it’s OK, I’m praying to G-d and he is going to save me.” So the rowboat went on.
Then a motorboat came by. The fellow in the motorboat shouted, “jump in, I can save you.” To this the stranded man said, “No thanks, I’m praying to G-d and he is going to save me. I have faith.” So the motorboat went on.
Then a helicopter came by and the pilot shouted down, “Grab this rope and I will lift you to safety.” To this the stranded man again replied, “No thanks, I’m praying to G-d and he is going to save me. I have faith.” So the helicopter reluctantly flew away.
Soon the water rose above the rooftop and the man drowned. He went “upstairs”. He finally got his chance to discuss this whole situation with G-d, at which point he exclaimed, “I had faith in you but you didn’t save me, you let me drown. I don’t understand why!”
To this G-d replied, “I sent you a rowboat and a motorboat and a helicopter, what more did you expect?”
And now to answer your question:
The Torah instructs us to protect our lives in every way possible, spiritual and physical. Obviously, in the event of physical danger r”l, in addition to applying spiritual protection, we must do all we can to protect ourselves in a physical way, following standard security procedures. (This should be discussed with the local security agencies, police department, etc., in conjunction with the local Rav/Shliach).
One can ask the same question regarding Hashem’s protection in general: we are promised that “the guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps”. Should that mean that we should not apply physical protection as well? Should a Jewish soldier not wear a helmet? Obviously not.
So too in regards to mezuzah: we are taught that the mitzvah of mezuzah brings longevity to those who keep it, and even more –  it provides protection to the house and its residents (even when they are outside of the house), and to all Yidden throughout the world. However, in the event of physical danger r”l, we must apply physical protection in addition to making sure we have kosher mezuzahs affixed to our doorposts. This does not in any way imply that the mezuza is an insufficient measure of protection, rather, that Hashem will help our standard security procedures in the merit of the mezuza.
We find a similar idea regarding parnasa: while the Torah teaches us that it is Hashem’s blessing which gives a person parnasa, everyone understands that this blessing needs a “vessel” in which to rest. For someone to say that he won’t work because he is relying on Hashem’s Bracha is foolish and wrong. So too we must take natural measures in security issues, and one who refrains from doing this is held responsible.
A story to illustrate: there was a chosid who experienced a break-in to his vehicle and asked the Rebbe (amongst other things) if he should check his mezuzas. The Rebbe answered that he should make sure the vehicle is locked at night.","###question

Soon the water rose above the rooftop and the man drowned. He went “upstairs”. He finally got his chance to discuss this whole situation with G-d, at which point he exclaimed, “I had faith in you but you didn’t save me, you let me drown. I don’t understand why!”
To this G-d replied, “I sent you a rowboat and a motorboat and a helicopter, what more did you expect?”
And now to answer your question:
The Torah instructs us to protect our lives in every way possible, spiritual and physical. Obviously, in the event of physical danger r”l, in addition to applying spiritual protection, we must do all we can to protect ourselves in a physical way, following standard security procedures. (This should be discussed with the local security agencies, police department, etc., in conjunction with the local Rav/Shliach).
One can ask the same question regarding Hashem’s protection in general: we are promised that “the guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps”. Should that mean that we should not apply physical protection as well? Should a Jewish soldier not wear a helmet? Obviously not.
So too in regards to mezuzah: we are taught that the mitzvah of mezuzah brings longevity to those who keep it, and even more –  it provides protection to the house and its residents (even when they are outside of the house), and to all Yidden throughout the world. However, in the event of physical danger r”l, we must apply physical protection in addition to making sure we have kosher mezuzahs affixed to our doorposts. This does not in any way imply that the mezuza is an insufficient measure of protection, rather, that Hashem will help our standard security procedures in the merit of the mezuza.
We find a similar idea regarding parnasa: while the Torah teaches us that it is Hashem’s blessing which gives a person parnasa, everyone understands that this blessing needs a “vessel” in which to rest. For someone to say that he won’t work because he is relying on Hashem’s Bracha is foolish and wrong. So too we must take natural measures in security issues, and one who refrains from doing this is held responsible.
A story to illustrate: there was a chosid who experienced a break-in to his vehicle and asked the Rebbe (amongst other things) if he should check his mezuzas. The Rebbe answered that he should make sure the vehicle is locked at night."
" Is it permissible to mix essential oils of the Ketores ingredients (Myrr, galbanum, etc.) in an inexact way? I want to smell what the Ketores smells like as a way to “live with the Geula”.","Even if one makes a very little amount of Ketores but with the same proportions as prescribed in Chazal, he is violating a Torah prohibition and is punished with the penalty of kores. According to some opinions, it is prohibited even if one does not use all 11 spices. Even if one uses other spices but the four key spices – tzari, tziporen, chelbnah and levonah – are the same as written in the Torah, using the same proportions, it is prohibited. Others maintain that even if  all 11 spices are different,  as long as these are spices whose smoke rises upward (or, according to one opinion, it potentially can rise straight) and produce smell it is prohibited if done with the same proportions as the formal Ketores.
This however may be done if you change the proportions of the various different spices. It is not sufficient to change the amounts; the actual proportions must be different.
As an aside, I fail I understand the need for doing this in order to live with Geulah. The way to live with redemption has been taught to us by our sages, namely, studying portions of Torah dealing with Moshiach and redemption, conducting ourselves in thought speech and action as appropriate for such special times etc.  there’s no need to come up with our own creative ideas and reinvent the wheel.

" What is the criteria for determining whether to say Tefilas Haderech?
Question: 
What is the criteria for determining whether to say tefilas haderech? We are taking a 3-hour drive to Connecticut, some of it is mountains. But like every minute (maybe a drop less or a drop more) I see a house or a few houses."," 
Tefilas haderech should be recited if a person travels at least a parsah (approximately 2.4 miles) past iburah shel ir (the outskirts of the city). Iburah shel ir is equivalent to approximately 108 ft. after the last house of the city.
It is difficult to define the precise definition of a city and a village, but it is certain that individual homes are not even a village, but a city with many residents and permanent businesses throughout the year, and schools are considered a city. But for tefilas haderech, maybe even less than that could be considered a city.
Once a person leaves that vicinity, even if there are houses along the way, one should say tefilas haderech.

" Is the human placenta Kosher?
Hi, I am Chabad, and I have a birthing class, and it came up few times in the class about women eating their placenta after birth. Some eat fresh and some have company encapsulating. So, I would like to know if there is any Jewish source for this custom? What is the halachic ruling pertaining to this for a healthy delivery vs. some issues with iron levels in the mother to blood loss, etc?","
Scientifically: It is highly debatable whether scientifically there is any health advantage to this practice. See for example here.
Halachicly: I’ll focus only on the halachic aspect. Eating placenta per se is problematic according to Halacha as human flesh is forbidden to be eaten. It might also fall under the category of mi’us. (Note that customarily placenta used to be buried – certainly not eaten).
A leniency could be justified only for sick people who need medication. Nonetheless, when ground and encapsulated there is more room for leniency.
However, being that this isn’t a “recognized cure” (refuah yeduah) it’s not so lchatchillah. If there are other alternatives available, or if it’s not really that important, one shouldn’t use this method.","###question

 One may not place a chocolate cake in an area where the chocolate will melt. In addition to the issue of actively melting something, there are concerns of cooking.

 Are Potato Chips/Pringles with an OU Fine?,"Potato chips – fried potato chips should be Bishul Yisroel. However steam cooked potato chips do not need to be exclusively bishul Yisroel.
Pringles – there is a Machlokes in regards to regular Potato chips if they need to be Bishul Yisroel and one should be stringent as mentioned, however, even according to the lenient opinion, there is room to be more stringent in regards to pringles.
Reasoning:
Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh Deah 113:1) requires Bishul Yisroel only on foods that are Oleh Al Shulchan Melachim (that would be served at the meals of royalty).
The Chachmas Adom 66:4 writes that foods like potato cuttings require to be Bishul Yisroel.
Although most opinions maintain that we define Oleh al Shulchan Melachim solely by the fact how it is served right now (if it is fit for a meal of royalty), since a fried potato would require to be bishul Yisroel, the potato chip should also be bishul Yisroel,
despite the fact that it is cut thin.
This would be analogous to a piece of meat: one cannot say that only certain cuts of meat that are fancy require Bishul Yisroel and non-fancy cuts of meat do not require Bishul Yisroel.
However If the potato chips are steam cooked, it does not require to be bishul Yisroel (see Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 113:13).
Pringles made from potato starch or potato flour – if the potato was cooked first it would have needed to be bishul Yisroel before it was turned into potato starch.
Therefore, Pringles are different than potato chips since during the process they were already cooked like regular potatoes even though they are dried afterward. Thus, it is problematic even for those who would argue that potato chips are fine, since the original Issur when it was cooked by a non-Jew remains. (Those who allow it use certain leniencies and some claim it’s better than potato chips.)

" Is one allowed to be on an “entertaining” WhatsApp group where sometimes the Admin shares videos and voice notes that contain Lashon Hora, Harassment to other Yidden, mocking of Rabonim etc.?","If this is the sole purpose of the WhatsApp group, obviously it is absolutely forbidden.
Even if the WhatsApp group contains other “kosher” entertainment, and one has the practical ability to skip over all the forbidden sections (which needs to be properly determined if this is at all practically possible), one may not rely on one’s temerity that they will avoid reading or viewing the un-kosher sections, unless this is their only necessary outlet for such “kosher” entertainment.
As a general principle: Wherever one has a choice to avoid situations where they might confront negative thoughts or behaviors, they are obligated to do so according to Halacha. In cases where this is the only method available for them to receive that which they require, then they may use this channel but must avoid doing (viewing, reading etc.) that which is forbidden.

There are several issues at play here and we will attempt to analyze them one by one.
Endorsement of a secular organization:
Though voting is somewhat of an endorsement of the organization at large, it appears to me that this is the same as voting for Knesset, which has been encouraged by virtually all gedolei Yisroel. I have subsequently heard the same opinion from another contemporary Posek who shared with me his position as above.
This is very different to joining the Synagogue council of America, something which was banned by gedolei Yisroel, as it indicates a recognition of movements who deny the creeds of our faith, among them the authenticity of Torah.

 Is it allowed to vote in the following to help make the land of Israel frumer? They ask for affirmation on Zionism, that is NOT the Rebbe’s shita. Attached is what one needs to agree to to.
Here is the link to the Frum slate site: Eretzhakodesh.org.
 ###answer 
 
There are several issues at play here and we will attempt to analyze them one by one.
Endorsement of a secular organization:
Though voting is somewhat of an endorsement of the organization at large, it appears to me that this is the same as voting for Knesset, which has been encouraged by virtually all gedolei Yisroel. I have subsequently heard the same opinion from another contemporary Posek who shared with me his position as above.

 Does one need to ask a Rav before being induced? Is there any Halachic issue?,"
This matter is discussed in a number of Poskim. The general rule is that one may not induce or rush the onset of labor unless there are clear medical reasons to require it. Some of the reasons for this prohibition are because:
There is a level of risk inherent to childbirth, and one should therefore not hasten it even though it is bound to come.
The special assurance of protection Hashem provides at the time of childbirth does not necessarily apply to the same degree if the birth is hastened without a clear medical need.
The procedures and/or medicines involved in induction can themselves cause complications, and one should not take that risk needlessly.","###question

" How to properly reward children for their good behavior?
When rewarding good behavior, Is it at all oisgehalten to choose certain missions that are mandatory, meaning if they miss those mandatory ones, they will not get rewarded for the other (non-mandatory) missions? I know that we always tell people on mivtzoim “even though you just ate non-Kosher it’s irrelevant whether or not to put on tefillin now”.
My question is when it comes to chinuch does that same rule apply?","
You may choose whichever system works for you or for the purpose you’re trying to achieve. Furthermore, there might be a particular advantage in using the system that you have outlined. A reward system by nature indicates that what the child is doing is something extra, not required. When you start rewarding for behaviors which are expected from the children it subtly implies that these behaviors are not obligatory behaviors. For example, we don’t normally reward children for keeping Shabbos. If we have a reward system for observing Tznius, we are implying that tznius is an extra unnecessary commitment.","###question

 May I use Maaser to buy Mishloach Manos to give my students?,"One is obligated to send two Manos to at least one person. This obligation cannot be fulfilled with money from maiser.

 Article: Do I have to fast?,"The most stringent of all fast days is Yom Kippur, since fasting is min haTorah (a Biblical law), as the passuk in Parashas Acharei Mos says: “Ta’anu es nafshoseichem” (afflict your souls)—and the severe punishment for not fasting is kareis (early death by Divine decree). Only a heter (dispensation) dispensed by a rav in critical circumstances and in a strictly prescribed manner would allow breaking the fast. A choleh she’ein bo sakanah (a person who has a non-life threatening illness) and similarly, a woman who is expecting or nursing (under normal circumstances), must fast.
Four other fasts are rooted in divrei kabbalah (the words of receiving, i.e. from the Prophets): Tzom Gedaliah, Asara B’Teves, Shiva’a Asar B’Tammuz and Tisha B’Av, and they are subject to stricter rules than for other laws mi’d’rabbanan (of Rabbinic origin). (Taanis Esther is in a different category of minhag—custom.)
Tisha B’Av, due to its history of huchpalu bo tzaros (double tragedies), is more stringently observed: We begin fasting at sunset the evening before and observe the additional bodily afflictions as on Yom Kippur. But the other three fasts of divrei kabbalah are more minor; they were instituted for calamities associated with the churban (destruction [of the Temple]) and during times of relative peace afterwards were commemorated only as a standing tradition previously accepted by Klal Yisroel (the Jewish people).
One of the leniencies of these three fasts is that an expectant or nursing mother who is mitzta’eres harbeh (in much physical discomfort) does not have to fast. Poskim state that lav davka (not necessarily) must the discomfort be acute—even some difficulty suffices as a heter. By contrast, a choleh she’ein bo sakanah, and similarly, an expectant or nursing mother who is suffering undue weakness or one who is at a stage of her pregnancy where fasting is deemed unhealthy for her (or for the fetus) and would therefore be considered a choleh—is patur (exempt) from fasting on all four fast days, including Tisha B’Av.
A mother of small children who is not expecting or nursing is not included in this heter, and neither is one who is paid to care for others’ children, as there is hardly a career or calling that exempts an individual from the halachic obligation to fast. One halachic opinion states that women should not have to fast for twenty four months after giving birth (the official halachic time span for nursing) and another exempts all those of childbearing age, but these views are rejected by mainstream poskim.
There is some extra leniency regarding Tzom Gedaliah (compared to the other two fasts of divrei kabbalah) for those who are not otherwise exempt, but would not be physically able to fast on Yom Kippur only one week after fasting on Tzom Gedaliah. In such a case, a rav should be consulted.

If they were used for Treif, they should not be Kashered.
Similarly, if they were used throughout the year for Chometz, they should not be Kashered and may not be used for Pesach."

For the time being, if there are no places available to tovel keilim, one can give to a non Jew and then borrow it from them. This exempts the dishes from tevilah for the time being.

My child goes to playgroup and we pay at the beginning of every month. Due to the coronavirus, my child is at home and not going to the playgroup. The teacher from our playgroup still wants us to pay even though our child isn’t even going. Do I have any obligation to pay?","
(Firstly, this response is only on a general level and various technicalities can change the result of the answer. For example one needs to see what was written on the contract of the school. One needs to see if there was a “force of majeure” stipulation in place, it might also depend if and how much the school is providing online services and projects.)
Because there’s so many factors that can influence the decision in this case and also because there are multiple opinions on this matter, in the absence of a properly scheduled DIn Torah, it is appropriate to reach some compromise between the parties. This is the advice that Batei Dinim all over the world are telling people.
One suggested compromise: March should be paid in full (especially if one already paid for the month).
For the month of April, one will have to see how the situation evolves. If the school will not open, and no services are provided, one should pay a partial amount. (There is room for a school to expect “Pesach vacation pay” in addition to full March, this matter should properly considered by way of a mutual compromise agreement.)
It should be noted that it is very likely that if one does not pay the expected amount that the school is asking, the school might not accept the students afterwards. They could be in the right by doing so. This is an important point to consider.
If one already prepaid for months after Pesach, different rules might apply.
Reasoning:
Firstly, since the schools were running as usual for the first half of March, there is no question that they should get regular payment for the first half. For the second half of the month, if one already paid for the month, it is proper not to demand for any money back.
If one did not yet pay for the month of March, then it is proper to reach a  (that both parties agree upon as fair) and also pay something for the missed time, this is especially if the school is trying to provide schooling programs online and projects.
However, in this unique situation, since a school usually gets paid Pesach vacation, this should be considered as well. Whether one were to give for the second half of March or for the first half of April it still comes to the same amount of a full tuition month of March. Thus, the month of March should in this situation be paid in full.
After Pesach (for the month of April and onward) many maintain that there is no obligation to pay provided that the agreement is only month by month payment agreements, unless the school will reopen Be’ezras Hashem.
By the letter of the law, when work seizes due to unforeseen circumstances, the loss is on the worker or provider. See Rema Choshen Mishpat 334:1 & Taz, & Nesivos Hamishpat 334:1.

Whereas in 321:1 the Rema discusses when there is no way at all to continue working. This is also the view of the Maharam Paduah cited in the Shach 334:3 that in such a case where the government does not allow the teachers to work. (The latter seems more fitting with the corona virus pandemic situation.)

  My gas stove is the type that lights itself as soon as you begin to turn the knob, it then goes from High to Low. Can I turn it on on Yom Tov or would I have to turn on from before Yom Tov?.
 ###answer 
 You can skip the “ignite” by going straight to high/low and lighting with a match. Alternatively (and preferably), you can pull out the plug and light with a match.

I was asked on Mivtzoim if it’s OK to smoke marijuana on Pesach or there’s a problem with it?,"
For ingesting marijuana:
If it’s medical marijuana that a Dr. prescribed for an ill individual, and it’s a pill then it would be allowed.
However if not, it poses a halachic problem. Besides for the issue of kitniyos, it would need to have a Hechsher like any vitamin, as it’s made with a variety of ingredients which need to be verified that they are kosher in general, and for pesach specifically,
For smoking or injecting marijuana:
Hard to use the specific term kosher (fit for a Jew) to eat since it is not kosher for a Jew to smoke or inject marijuana, for the following reasons:

" Is Quinoa Kosher for Pesach?
I am very confused about this. All the years I’ve heard that most poskim maintain that quinoa is considered kitniyos. Now I am hearing that there is new information on the topic and that is been agreed that it is not kitniyos.
May I use it on Pesach or not?","
The common consensus of most poskim on this topic is that it is considered kitniyos for all practical purposes. The few kashrus agencies that are authorizing it are pushing this product on the market—and even they maintain that it needs a reliable proper hechsher as it might have some grain mixed into it—but that does not change the consensus within mainstream halacha.
Explanation:
The key argument to permit quinoa is that this is considered a new type of food which wasn’t around when the decree against kitniyos was made and thus it is not included in the original prohibition against kitniyos.
This argument has been repeated many times about different things. However, klal Yisroel has not accepted this argument. The custom is not to use peanuts, and more specifically — corn, even though these foods were not around then.
In fact, the original poskim who mentioned the prohibition against kitniyos do not list the various type of foods. The basic assumption is that anything that has the properties of kitniyos is included. Furthermore, from the extensive discussion in poskim about why potatoes are permitted on Pesach it is clear that the fact that this was a new food was not germane to the discussion.
Quinoa has all the properties of kitniyos and all the reasons mentioned in poskim apply just as much if not more to quinoa. Certainly, it has more similarity to grain than corn does.
It should be noted that even though Rabbi Moshe Feinstein has ruled to permit peanuts, he agreed that corn remains forbidden. His son Rabbi Dovid Feinstein states clearly that the same applies to quinoa. (The arguments to distinguish between corn and quinoa based on its Yiddish name and its high popularity are a far stretch and inconsistent with the position of Reb Moshe himself. It is obvious that Reb Moshe’s position to allow peanuts is not based on the sole factor of it being a new food. He explained elsewhere why corn remains forbidden because it fits well with the general criteria of kitniyos, unlike potatoes and peanuts. Accordingly, in his opinion quinoa should be forbidden. As mentioned this is also the position of his son, Reb Dovid.)
The classification of quinoa as kitniyos applies also the other areas in halacha. With regard to the rules of kilayim for example, it is clear that quinoa is considered kitniyos. There’s no reason to make any distinction when it comes to this very important minhag, which many poskim, including the Tzemach Tzedek, state that it applies even during times of hunger. A proper understanding of the Alter Rebbe words in Shulchan Aruch leads us to this conclusion too.
To the best of my knowledge this is also the position of most Chabad Rabbonim the world over. The position that quinoa is unacceptable as kitniyos is shared by many many contemporary poskim. To name just a few: Rabbi Elyashiv, Rabbi Neubort, Rabbi Shlomo Miller, Rabbi Usher Weiss, Rabbi Westheim — and many other well known kashrus agencies. (For a through treatmet of this matter, see Kovetz Etz Chaim, vol. XXVIII).
The very fact that all those who permit quinoa warn strongly to use it only if it goes through a proper certification process because of the serious concern that it might have a mixture of other grains is telling. Indeed, one of the reasons for the original prohibition against kitniyos is this very fact that it often mixes with other grain.
In conclusion: there’s no reason to change our behavior this year than all previous years. The minhag to forbid kitniyos is an important one and should not be dropped for convenience reasons, without a consensus that a particular food isn’t included. There are many other alternatives for healthy food on the market for Pesach.","###question

" We don’t have enough wine for the Seder. What should we do?
We are Shluchim on a small island. A week ago the government made alcohol sales illegal and shut down supermarkets, we are not allowed to leave our home at all.

A bottle of 750 ml contains close to 9 revi’is , i.e. about 9 cups of wine. If you drink only the majority of the cups, you should have much more left. Since the wine is pagum, you must first add more wine to it. For the last cup you must drink an entire revi’is in order to make al hagefen and you can exempt your wife – who will only drink majority of the cup – with the beracha.
You can also add a bit of water so long as it serveable as wine and would normally be drunk as wine.
If you still don’t have enough you can substitute the wine with coffee and tea.
You should preferably use the wine  for the 1st cup of Kiddush and 3rd cup for birchas hamazon.

 When and how can women greet men?,"Q. I taught my students the Sicha about shlomis bas divri – how she greeted and spoke to everybody. We know that a woman isn’t allowed to greet a man, what are the exact halachos? What about family/family friends? Can the students say good morning to the security guard out of mentchlichkait? What if it is someone respectable?
A. A man or woman may not create closeness ו  וו with a man through asking how the other is doing and other types of indirect affection.
However, one may say ‘Hello’ or ‘good morning’ since this is generally interpreted as a form of ‘social norms’ which is not showing even indirect affection.
Nonetheless one should always be aware of the issue to ensure that no problems ever ensue. The Yam Shel Shlomo (Kiddushin 4:25) writes that a man, depending on his inclination and how he knows himself, can weigh how he should speak with women.

" May one watch the “Patterns Of Evidence” series?

“Patterns Of Evidence” is a heavily advertised series of videos and books. In short, it is ran by Christians who go on missions to present evidence for the episodes in the ו. This includes, evidence for  מם,  ם וף and the sinking of the walls of ו amongst other episodes. Filmmakers scoured the areas that  מם and  ם וף are believed to have taken place, and they dig in the ground, dive in to water, collect earth, search for footprints etc. to present evidence for the occurrences that are recorded in the ו.
For example; I have not watched any of the episodes, but I heard that they scoured the מ, and found in middle of the מ an area where there were twelve wells of water, and seventy palm trees. I cannot confirm this because I did not watch any of the episodes, but, from what I heard, this is the type of investigative research that they do.
Though it is led by Christians, they do not seem to present any “evidence” for anything that is recorded in the “new testament”. It seems to be purely films to provide evidence for the “old testament”. I could not find any mention of וו  on their website. In fact, it took me some time to discover that it is even led by Christians.
In fact, in their “about us” page, they describe themselves as follows:
“Guided by curiosity and an unflinching desire to uncover the truth, documentary filmmaker Timothy Mahoney embarked on a search for evidence – archaeological, scientific, and even literary – that would shed light on whether the events chronicled in the Bible really happened or not. What do the world’s leading archaeologists and biblical scholars have to say about these questions? Were ancient Israelites really held in bondage in Egypt? Did Moses really lead them out to the Promised Land? Did the walls of Jericho really come tumbling down? Is there any truth to these stories?
The results of this amazing 12-year investigation may change the way the world will view history and the Bible”.
My question to the  is;
Given that we live in an era when ו in general, and the historical episodes in the ו in particular are mocked and ridiculed in an unprecedented manner, and what more, we are all exposed to the mockery wherever we turn, would it be permissible for a  to watch these films and / or read these books, to strengthen his מו and confidence in the ו?

" Should I be washing my baby Negel Vasser properly?
Full Question:
I read on AskTheRav that the Alter Rebbe says that since the Bris one who doesn’t allow your baby to touch food without Negel Vasser is considered holy. (See here)
We’ve been washing my baby Negel Vasser since he was born. Since he is so little and moves around many times his Negel Vasser doesn’t cover the whole hand and is not done perfectly. Also he sleeps multiple times a day.
Do I need to wash him every time he wakes up and make sure it’s a perfect Negel Vasser before he touches food?
In other words what is the age where I have to actually begin worrying about the tumah on his hands and be stringent, as opposed to now, when it’s more preferable and more for Chinuch?","
If you are accepting upon yourself this added stringency, you should ensure that the baby washes Negel Vasser exactly as an adult should, and make sure water reaches the entire hands.
However, this stringency does not necessarily include washing after every times your baby naps, as even food that is touched by an adult who takes a nap by day is permitted to be eaten.
For those who do not take on this added stringency, Halacha mandates to be careful regarding touching before Negel Vasser for a child who has reached the age of Chinuch, approximately 6 or 7 years old.
To add clarification, this Hiddur mentioned in Poskim isn’t due to the Mitzvah of Chinuch. Although as Chassidim we know that Chinuch starts from the youngest age – and even earlier, Halachically, Chinuch doesn’t start until a child is already “the age of Chinuch”. Thus, even according to those opinions that things done for Chinuch can be done ‘symbolically’ without all the details (a subject of itself with many parameters), this Hiddur when observed should be kept with all the details.","###question

 If there is a chance that the goy will realize and it will thus cause a Chilul Hashem then one must inform the goy (therefore when possible one should tell the goy that “I’m relying on your calculation”). Likewise,  if asked about this by the goy you cannot deny that you received the extra goods.
In absence of the above circumstances you may keep the additional item.
*The above is the “letter of the law”. It must however be mentioned that the Sefer Chasidim writes, (roughly:)
“Do not do treat the goyim unjustly as this will only pull you down and the debt will be repaid either by you or your descendants”.
The Poskim indeed bear witness, that people who gained from a goy’s mistake saw only misfortune from their choice, whereas many of those who made a Kiddush Hashem by returning costly items merited great wealth for themselves and future generations."
" Is one allowed to do Nefilas Apayim while the Torah is out of the Aron, and if yes how should it be done?","Regarding placing the head on the arm etc. – it is done as usual.
When the Sefer Torah is being moved and requires one to stand, one should not be sitting, but may continue reciting the Nefilas Apayim prayer normally. Nonetheless, according to Kabalah, Nefilas Apayim should always be done sitting. Therefore, it is best to wait and recite it once the Sefer Torah is in a stationary position.

" Can a girl work in the younger division of a boys camp?

Is there an issue having an unmarried girl in camp?","
Absolutely unacceptable. Even with married staff, there are concerns, certainly with teenagers. It is obvious that single boys and girls working together will undoubtedly lead to a sub-conscious laxity in tznius, and can extend even outside the workspace as they get more comfortable with each other, or in general, they can become comfortable with the opposite gender – a breach of the wall of tznius that exists in our society where boys/girls are kept separate. Often the staff will need to be in contact regarding different matters (transportation, trips, deliveries, etc.) that will require direct communication via cell phone, with its consequences.
I would rather not elaborate on such a topic, but many issues have arisen from such camps, with many having long-term effects. (I want to add that putting boys/girls in this situation with these challenges is a severe violation of Lifnei Iver, and very unfair to them, especially if they are/were unaware. Some counselors will be too embarrassed to speak up about it although the situation is difficult for them or they know it’s wrong).

Proper dress – in a camp setting, people might come to be dressed in a way which is forbidden for someone of the opposite gender to see (this is a problem regardless but obviously doubled when an opposite gender is there).

 Is cotton Tzitzis kosher according to Halacha and could you make a Bracha on it?,"
When one wears a woolen four-cornered garment, he is certainly fulfilling a Mitzvah Min Hatorah. However, when one wears a cotton four-cornered garment, there is a dispute as to whether he is fulfilling a Mitzvah Min Hatorah or Miderabanan. That is why it is generally preferred to wear woolen four-cornered garments, and this is Minhag Chabad.
Another dispute concerning a cotton four-cornered garment is whether one may attach to them Tzitzis strings made out of wool, or whether the strings must be made of cotton. The Alter Rebbe confirms that the custom is like the lenient opinion, but adds that every G-d fearing person should nevertheless be stringent and use only cotton Tzitzis strings on a cotton four-cornered garment. It must be noted that cotton Tzitzis strings are not commercially manufactured at present, which means that all cotton four-cornered garments available for purchase use woolen Tzitzis strings, and are thus not the ideal way of performing this Mitzvah.
In such a case of wool tzitzis on the cotton garment, a Bracha should ideally not be made on the tallis katan. However, there is room to justify the practice of those who make a bracha on it. (The Alter Rebbe says only “nachon hadavar”, not an issur. He doesn’t use the regular lashon of safek brachos lhakel, as we don’t hold that way, and it’s only a chumra. Furthermore, b’pashtus it’s only talking about when he has another proper tallis shel tzemer. In any event, the Alter Rebbe says that the minhag clearly is to put tzemar tzitzis in meshi. And in the place of a minhag, we don’t say safek brachos lhakel).
For both of these reasons, the Alter Rebbe states that one who wishes to keep this Mitzvah in the best way should ensure that both the four-cornered garment as well as the Tzitzis strings are made of wool.","###question

 Is there a known reason why it is not customarily for Chabad Chassidim to take Shabbos in early?,"In Shulchan Oruch, bringing in Shabbos early is regarded as a noble practice. Nevertheless, in 770, Shabbos was never brought in early, and it is common practice in Chabad not to bring Shabbos in early.

However, the Rebbe responded something to the effect that to bring in Shabbos early is not Minhag Chabad.]
Possible suggested reasons for this practice:
1. The Alter Rebbe writes (in his Teshuvos) that it has become customary to be stringent and not daven Maariv before Tzeis, and the Tzemach Tzedek writes that someone who is particular about this should do so even at the expense of davening with a Minyan before Tzeis. Even so, it is not completely clear whether their words apply to Friday night or just other nights of the week. See also here:
  ום מם ו  , ם ף  מום   ו    ו  זמן ו  ?
2. Bringing in Shabbos early requires one to adhere to the relevant associated Dinim, such as davening Mincha before Plag and Maariv after Plag, repeating Shema after Tzeis Hakochavim, reciting Kiddush and beginning the meal more than half hour before Tzeis Hakochavim. Included in this is ensuring that one has the right times for Plag and Tzeis, as there are different ways of calculating it. According to some Achronim, the husband’s Kabbolas Shabbos will influence when the wife has to Bentch Licht, but it does not clear that the Alter Rebbe would hold this way, and there are also a number of other reasons to be lenient.
3. When a Kehillah brings in Shabbos early, this can enforce Kabbolas Shabbos on individuals as well, subject to a number of conditions, which may inconvenience their Shabbos preparations or impede their chance to daven Mincha. This will also be detrimental for those people who are not yet Frum. [See ו” ’ ” ף ” about having concern for others]
4. Not bringing in Shabbos early allows one time to learn Chassidus after Shabbos comes in, as a preparation for Kabbolas Shabbos and Maariv. [ ן ’ ”ז ” ”ו]
5. Some Achronim explain that the Maalah of bringing in Shabbos early is primarily when it is done for Hiddur Mitzvah and Kovod Shabbos, and not out of convenience. For example, if it is done year round instead of just in the summer. [ו מ ו” ” ’ ”,  מ ” ’ ”ו]

In general, any residue (which has actual substance, not just color) has the same status as food, and would consequently emit  equally.
Practically speaking, when baking fish in a meat oven (at least) one of the following conditions must be met:
The oven is clean from any meat residue etc.
The fish is fully covered."

" Can the husband be in the delivery room, especially if there is no doula present?
I am a doctor. I have seen from personal experience that people get better care if they are not alone in the hospital. Especially sometimes if the woman is alone during birth, she may be pressured to do a procedure to save a doctor or other provider time which is not necessary and can lead to negative health outcomes for herself or the newborn baby.","
According to halacha, there are serious concerns with the husband being present in the delivery room. Even where a potential heter can be found, the Rebbe spoke strongly against this practice and stated that it is considered a breach of modesty. The Rebbe commented that at the time of birth one should seek out extra z’chusim and certainly not add in matters which are the opposite of z’chus.
That being said, if there is a concern of danger or if the woman is actually scared (and not just because she wants it or because others are doing it…)  and there is no one else to assist, you may help and do as she needs. You should preferably wear gloves to minimize contact and face the other direction.","###question

 Do filter bags need to have a Hechsher since they are going into soups?,"The filter bags don’t need to be kosher but you must be sure that no bugs can leave the bag.
As for the idea of using such bags to prevent the need for checking: With foods that are certainly infested, one should not do this, but we need not admonish those who do, provided the garment is thick.
Where the food is not definitely infested, it may be done but one should check and clean first superficially.
Explanation in brief:
The bugs that are in the unchecked herbs would give off a bad taste to the soup and would be inconsequential (any non-kosher food that gives a bad taste to a kosher food is called Pagum and doesn’t make the kosher food non-kosher).
Even though one may not intentionally nullify something that is forbidden, here your intention is not to nullify the bugs but rather to add the taste of herbs to the soup.
Even if there is a remote concern that the bugs might have left the bag, we may assume that the bugs stayed in the bag, and even if they left the bag there is an assumption that the bugs became crushed during the cooking process and therefore could be nullified in the soup.","###question

However, Poskim and Rabbonim throughout the ages have encouraged to break the habit of picking one’s skin, lips or hair and biting nails, as it can lead to several Issurim, namely transgressing a possible Issur from the Torah if one would continue doing so on Shabbos.

 I had a couple of disturbing dreams that I was doing something against halacha. is it something I should ignore or is there something I should do about it?,"In general we are not particular about dreams nowadays, because we don’t really know how to interpret them properly; only a Rebbe can tell us their meaning.
Sometimes the yetzer hara tries to make us feel lowly by making us have such dreams, and we must ignore them and continue serving Hashem with joy. The Rebbe suggested to people that were disturbed by dreams try to find a positive interpretation for it,  be careful about saying Krias Shema at night, check the mezuza of the room they sleep in, and give tzedaka every erev shabbos and yom tov (men should also check their tefillin, give tzedaka every day as well as mikva).
However since dreams may be due to things we think about during the day, we must find ways to stop ourselves from having such thoughts (even thinking about a past dream). I suggest you discuss this with your mashpia (especially if you may be struggling with some of the things you dreamed about).

I’m not sure where you heard that. None of us can say with certainty that we know why tragedies happen. It’s true that Torah tells us that when tragedies happen we need to examine our behaviors and see which things require rectification. However, that does not mean that human beings can fathom the ways of Hashem and say that they absolutely know which particular behavior caused this particular tragedy. Even great tzadikim who are sometimes privy to the inner workings of Hashem in this world have many times stated about themselves that they cannot understand the ways of Hashem. Certainly, it is not our job to explain why certain things occurred.
As for your specific question about unfiltered internet: it is absolutely true that this is forbidden according to the Torah. The psak against unfiltered internet has been expressed by almost all Rabbonim from all circles (Chassidic, non-Chassidic, the so-called Modern Orthodox movement, etc.).
Whether such behavior is actually killing people I cannot claim to know, but I do know that it wreaks havoc on a person, his family and immediate surroundings. I guess you can say that it can cause spiritual death which is much worse, in many ways, than physical death. The tragedies caused by unfiltered internet, whether on a personal level, or the harmful effects on a marriage or a relationship, or on one’s connection to Hashem, are very real and are serious, and shouldn’t be underestimated. Thus, the correct thing to do is to immediately obtain proper filtering on your devices and protect yourself and your family. One thing is for sure this will bring great Bracha to yourself and to your loved ones. Just for this reason alone, it’s worthwhile to do so without delay.
Wishing you tremendous success in this resolution.","###question

"I know we don’t cut on Thursday, but is Wednesday night included too? Because the day starts from the night before.
Also, it there an inyan not to cut at nights (any other night)?","
Nails shouldn’t be cut on Wednesday night – like Thursday.
Regarding nights in general –
May I cut my hair and nails after chatzos (midday)?
Sifrei Kabbalah (Holy writings of Kabbalah) relate that the Arizal would refrain from having his hair cut after midday. Some are of the opinion that the same would apply to cutting nails. The question is: what was the reason for this custom?
If it was because we shouldn’t engage in any new melachah (work) once the zman (time) of Mincha has arrived—lest we be distracted from davening Mincha—then we can assume that there is no issue with cutting our hair after having davened Mincha. Nails, however, may be cut even before davening Mincha.
However, if the reason was that according to Kabbalah the forces of dinim (Heavenly judgment) begin gaining strength after midday, it would be cause to refrain from doing so throughout the entire afternoon, and in fact more so at night, when the dinim are even more severe. Although the influence of the forces of dinim is mentioned specifically only regarding haircuts, it can arguably be applied to nail cutting too.
Common practice, though, is that we do take haircuts and cut our nails after midday—provided that we have davened Mincha—and at night as well. Likewise, If one has a fixed minyan for davening Mincha, one need not refrain from engaging in melacha prior to davening.","###question

 May one substitute a shower for Negel Vasser in the morning before saying Asher Yotzar?,"We are required to wash our hands upon awakening in order to remove forces of impurity that cleave to our bodies during sleep, as well as in order to purify ourselves to serve Hashem and pray. Following washing, we recite a blessing (“al netilas yodaim”) followed by “asher yotazr” and the subsequent morning blessings.
The forces of impurity do not leave until they are washed 3 times with a cup, thus a shower does not suffice.
However one should remove the impurity as soon as possible, but not recite a blessing until taking care of one’s bodily needs, thus the proper sequence should be: Modeh Ani, washing of hands without the blessing (many wash before getting out of bed), bodily needs, shower, washing of hands with a blessing.

 May a man Tovel in a river on Shabbos?,"One may Tovel in a river on Shabbos if it’s for the purpose of Mikvah.

When one exits the water, he should dry himself well so as not to carry the water (but one shouldn’t dry one’s hair with his hands).

People will sometimes buy a “grand piano” for enormous amounts of money just to sit in the house. There is no objection for someone who plays music to own a piano and have it in their house. Certainly the objection does not apply to a electric keyboard and similar instruments.

" What is the proper Bracha for “beer bread“?
I’ve seen conflicting options on other websites and even those that say to make Shehakol. 
What would be the Chabad opinion on this?","
If the beer bread is majority water (more than 50%) and minority beer in the dough mix then even if one is not ו ו the bracha of Hamotzei is recited.
If the beer bread is not majority water in the dough mix then the blessing is מזוו. A   should be stringent not to eat from this bread until washing on a different piece of real bread first. If one is ו ו then they may recite מו on the bread itself. If one is satiated from this bread (even if one only ate a Kazayis) even if the satiation is achieved through other satiating foods eaten with the bread – one should make hamotzie on another piece of bread first.
Beer itself is not considered water.
Reasoning:
Seder Birchas Hanehanin 2:7 – Brings the view of the Rambam (Hilchos Brachos 3:9) of defining   ן when the dough is mixed with any liquid other than water. When other liquids than water are mixed with the flour it makes a dough which people do not normally set a meal on. This applies only when the majority of the liquid (more than 50%) is other than water. One would need to see what is the percentage of water ratio (other then water in the beer itself, which isn’t considered water). Also if other liquids (such as oil) are mixed in they would be included in the ratio.

 Is melba toast Mezones or Hamotzie?,"Depends;
If it’s the type which is eaten as a substitute for bread, the bracha is certainly Hamotzi.
Even when eaten as a cracker for noshing purposes, it would still be Hamotzi, but to avoid all doubt one should only eat it within a meal of bread. Of course, if one eats the shiur of kvius seudah he must wash and make Hamotzi regardless

Those that are made with water only or more water then other liquids are what we were referring to.

First of all, I want to give you a Brocha that you find your Bashert very soon so this answer will only have to be theoretical.
There is room according to Halacha to be lenient, in very specific conditions, when it is done under the supervision of a competent hashgasha.
In regards to Hashkafa whether using such intervention is appropriate, there are many factors to weigh in: on the hand once a person reaches the age of 35 the possibility of one being able to get pregnant in the natural way slowly decreases.
However, on the other hand, there are many Chabad Rabbanim that disapprove of such intervention and their view has support from various answers from the Rebbe on this topic. Also, there is always the possibility that your future husband may not agree to such procedure (the desire to have children the natural way is self understood and is based on strong ethical and haskafash considerations), and therefore this route may not be the preferred one for you in this situation. One should also weigh the fact that the success chances of such a procedure decreases significantly after the age of 35 as well as the regular potential side effects and risks and prohibitive price. The risks, though rare, include intra-abdominal bleeding, abscess, ovarian torsion, etc. (Aragona, C., Mohamed, M.A., Epinola, M.S.B. et al. (2011). Clinical complications after transvaginal oocyte retrieval in 7,098 IVF cycles. Fertil. Steril. 95:293-294.)
The American Society for Reproductive Medicine published a paper in 2007 that labeled egg- freezing as an “experimental procedure” and “not an established medical treatment” (ASRM Practice Committee. (2007). Essential elements of informed consent for elective oocyte cryopreservation: a practice committee opinion. Fertil. Steril. 88:1495-1496.) The primary concern is the safety of the fetus created from thawed eggs, though  studies have not shown any negative outcomes in children born from thawed eggs (Chian, R.C., Huang, J.Y.J., Tan. S.L. et al. (2008) Obstetric and perinatal outcome in 200 infants conceived from vitrified oocytes. Reprod. Biomed. Online, 16:608-610. Credits for the research material to C Kaufman, Derech Hatevah, 20, p. 27). Of course, there are arguments within halacha – aside for hashkafah – about the permissibility of undergoing an elective surgical procedure involving also general anesthesia, though as mentioned there are strong  grounds for leniency.","###question

One should also weigh the fact that the success chances of such a procedure decreases significantly after the age of 35 as well as the regular potential side effects and risks and prohibitive price. The risks, though rare, include intra-abdominal bleeding, abscess, ovarian torsion, etc. (Aragona, C., Mohamed, M.A., Epinola, M.S.B. et al. (2011). Clinical complications after transvaginal oocyte retrieval in 7,098 IVF cycles. Fertil. Steril. 95:293-294.)
The American Society for Reproductive Medicine published a paper in 2007 that labeled egg- freezing as an “experimental procedure” and “not an established medical treatment” (ASRM Practice Committee. (2007). Essential elements of informed consent for elective oocyte cryopreservation: a practice committee opinion. Fertil. Steril. 88:1495-1496.) The primary concern is the safety of the fetus created from thawed eggs, though  studies have not shown any negative outcomes in children born from thawed eggs (Chian, R.C., Huang, J.Y.J., Tan. S.L. et al. (2008) Obstetric and perinatal outcome in 200 infants conceived from vitrified oocytes. Reprod. Biomed. Online, 16:608-610. Credits for the research material to C Kaufman, Derech Hatevah, 20, p. 27). Of course, there are arguments within halacha – aside for hashkafah – about the permissibility of undergoing an elective surgical procedure involving also general anesthesia, though as mentioned there are strong  grounds for leniency."
"We face a choice: should we continue it as people are requesting and make more machlokes with the shliach or just stop it and let people to go their way without davening?

In general, one is not allowed to take away someone else’s Zechus, in this case, the local shliach, and start your own Minyan. Although there are exceptions to this rule where it’s permissible, and sometimes even encouraged, if it causes machlokes it’s not worthwhile.
Although I can’t judge the situation from afar, I cannot imagine this is what the Rebbe would want.

I would suggest working together with the shliach and working something out to encourage as many people as possible to daven properly.
There might be also an issue of hasagas gvul (unacceptable competition) which can be resolved only through an impartial Rov or Beis Din presiding over the matter
You could wait for the Shliach to invite you to a Din Torah, but a more praiseworthy and commendable approach would be to take the first step and suggest this avenue to the local Shliach. This would demonstrate a genuine desire to do what is right and a readiness to invest diligent effort to achieve true peace.

I have an hour walk to the Mikvah Friday night. So we want to hire a babysitter so my husband can walk with me. How can we pay her for this “work” done on Shabbos?,"One may not accept schar Shabbos (payment for work done on Shabbos). Even though one is being paid after Shabbos, it is nevertheless forbidden since the work is being done on Shabbos.
Accepting payment for babysitting on Shabbos falls under the category of schar Shabbos. However, schar Shabbos behavla’ah (when “absorbed” with other payment) is permissible, but only if all of the following conditions are met:
The babysitter must be paid for babysitting done during the week or month, and not solely for babysitting on Shabbos. If either employee or employer have the right to opt out of the agreement, and the employee would then get paid pro rata (proportionally), it doesn’t qualify as schar Shabbos behavla’ah, even if it includes payment for weekdays.
In your specific case you should hire the babysitter to work at least a hour before shabbos and have it considered one job (before Shabbos and after Shabbos), and make up to pay for the whole job not per hour, and that neither the employee nor the employer have the right to opt out of the agreement.","###question

Imagine candles the are lit to form a word where extinguishing the fire is not an issue.
2) The surface is not like writing on an established surface like paper or wood, rather it is projected through the surface and not clinging to any surface at all.

" We paid for a service through paypal . The seller is now asking us to pay for the fee. What is the halacha?
Question clarified:
We paid for a service through Paypal and were advised to send payment as friends to avoid the transaction fee. This option was not available and we had to make the payment right away so we sent it through regular PayPal. The seller is now asking us to pay for the fee. According to Paypal, the seller is responsible for the fee. What is the halachic view on this?","
Disclaimer: the following discusses the halachic components, not the legal ones.
If the seller – or service provider – didn’t stipulate anything in advance, the fee would be on the buyer, as per the PayPal guidelines. If he stipulated to avoid the fee and the buyer made the transaction with the fee, the fee is on the buyer. In other words the price was minus the fee. Had the seller intended to pay the fee, the price would have been higher to include it.

Thank you for your understanding.","###question 
  We paid for a service through paypal . The seller is now asking us to pay for the fee. What is the halacha?
Question clarified:
We paid for a service through Paypal and were advised to send payment as friends to avoid the transaction fee. This option was not available and we had to make the payment right away so we sent it through regular PayPal. The seller is now asking us to pay for the fee. According to Paypal, the seller is responsible for the fee. What is the halachic view on this?.
 ###answer 
 
Disclaimer: the following discusses the halachic components, not the legal ones.
If the seller – or service provider – didn’t stipulate anything in advance, the fee would be on the buyer, as per the PayPal guidelines. If he stipulated to avoid the fee and the buyer made the transaction with the fee, the fee is on the buyer. In other words the price was minus the fee. Had the seller intended to pay the fee, the price would have been higher to include it.

" I prepaid for the Mikveh when I was not required to pay. Would I have to pay for the next year or can I use the money that I paid originally as if it were on credit?
Question clarified:
I moved to town 2 years ago. Right when I moved in I put the yearly mikvah fee in the box.
I later found out that as an employee in the mosad, I don’t have to pay. So I didn’t pay for the second year. Now I will not be working in the mosad anymore. Would I have to pay for the next year or can I use the money that I paid originally as if it were on credit?","
It depends on your thoughts originally when you discovered that you really don’t need to pay. If you intended to collect the money back, it is yours and thus you can now use it as credit. If you decided to leave it and given up on collecting, it becomes property of the Mikveh.

 A Lubavitcher Bochur who has not put on Tefillin for a long time put on Rashis but doesn’t want to put on Rabbeinu Tam because he doesn’t plan on continuing. Is he right or is it better that he does it once in a while rather than never?,"In my opinion:
If every time he agrees to put on Tefillin he is going to be pressured to also put on Rabeinu Tam, he may not agree so fast to put on Tefillin anymore. So it’s up to you to play it smart and know when to offer Rabeinu Tam and when to refrain from it.
It should also be noted that the Rebbe did not include Rabeinu Tam in Mivtza Tefillin. Rabeinu Tam is more the person’s own responsibility towards himself, versus Mivtzoim where we have a responsibility towards others as well.
Additionally, it should be noted that, when the Rebbe instructed all men to put on Rabeinu Tam from Bar Mitzva, it was with a stipulation that the person owns a pair, so that he will be able to wear them every day, implying that Rabeinu Tam should not be worn only once in a while.

If, however, one is unable to afford doing so, then one male rooster and one female chicken are sufficient to be used for all the male and female members of one’s household, respectively. Also, if the mosad arranging kaporos charges beyond the regular market value for the chickens (including price for shechita etc.), one may use maaser funds to pay for the difference."

"Our business is registration of charities in Canada. Many of our clients’ churches are Avodah Zara (Hindus, Buddhists). Is there an issue with taking them on as clients? (sechar, hana’ah from avoda zara, abizraihu, lifnei iver, etc.)

Thank you very much for hearing me out and I’m looking forward to your reply.","
First of all, you must know that you should try the most to serve Hashem with joy and kindness.
I also strongly suggest you speak to a Mashpia who knows you, to find out the best way to do Teshuva through Simcha.
In terms of your questions regarding the Torah views on sins and repentance etc.:
Indeed, if one doesn’t know the punishment they are considered shogeg and not liable for kares. This that ‘an error in study counts as deliberate sin’ (Mishna Avos 4:13) applies only to a Talmid Chacham. And even then, it does not reach the level to the punishment of Kares, ch”v. On the other hand, it is clear that one’s wrong actions require correction, even in the case of a complete mistake, since one is responsible for them and should learn about its laws in advance etc.
More specifically in your situation:
Kares would not apply, since at the time of the act it did not occur to you to think that she was a Niddah, nor did you enquire whether she was a Niddah or not (although normally it should be assumed that a unmarried girl who hasn’t gone to the mikvah is considered a Niddah).
Regarding acts that are punishable by Kares, the general rule is that Teshuva and Yom Kippur suspend punishment, and the pain which one suffers thereafter completes the atonement for him. Still, the main thing is to do Teshuva only.
Additionally, there are many ways to correct ‘Kares sins’ which are recorded in Sefarim. One example is to stay up an entire night learning Torah, exempting the person from the punishment of Kares.
To avoid the pain and sufferings, one must do (and increase) in the areas of Tzedakah, Gemilus Chassadim, and especially Talmud Torah. One should also accept every trouble and affliction instead of torment, and this will save him from the above mentioned pain etc.
See more in the Hebrew sources below and in the following link:
If I sin and do something against the Torah does G-D really love me? Will I go to Gehenom?
Again, the main and most important thing is to find a Mashpia that can advise you on all of this, and provide an appropriate Tikkun, in a way that will be personal and more practical based on your current capacities.

Additionally, there are many ways to correct ‘Kares sins’ which are recorded in Sefarim. One example is to stay up an entire night learning Torah, exempting the person from the punishment of Kares.
To avoid the pain and sufferings, one must do (and increase) in the areas of Tzedakah, Gemilus Chassadim, and especially Talmud Torah. One should also accept every trouble and affliction instead of torment, and this will save him from the above mentioned pain etc.
See more in the Hebrew sources below and in the following link:
If I sin and do something against the Torah does G-D really love me? Will I go to Gehenom?
Again, the main and most important thing is to find a Mashpia that can advise you on all of this, and provide an appropriate Tikkun, in a way that will be personal and more practical based on your current capacities.

 Can Mezonos wraps be considered Mezonos also for a Ba’al Nefesh?,"Q. The ones that say they are Mezonos, do they have the same issues of Mezonos Bread?
A. It depends on how they are made. If they’re made using flour and water, then they carry the same Bracha as bread, i.e. Hamotzi. However, if they are made with fruit juices or other liquids, then they will have the same rules as mezonos bread.
Q. Just to clarify: Does that mean to say that if they are made with fruit juices or other liquids, they are מזוו, however a   should be ממ not to eat them outside a meal, 
A. Correct, though some are stringent to treat so-called “mezonos bread” as safek hamotzi even for a non-ba’al nefesh. See here.
Regardless, usually, this is a moot issue because wraps especially (even more than mezonos bread) are eaten with fillings of tuna, egg salad, etc., and satiates. Thus, one enters the serious issue of kevius seudah.

 May an uncle babysit for his 3+ year old niece? I heard there is a leniency from Reb Moshe Feinstein.,"A man over 13 years old may not babysit a girl over 3 years old.
One should not rely on the leniency mentioned by Reb Moishe. This is against מ  ום ו ון וך which makes no distinction between the generations. His position has been rejected by many contemporary poskim.
Furthermore, even Reb Moshe only writes not to protest against those who are lenient, but he doesn’t outright permit it. Additionally, his questions are negated if we accept that the concern is ו  and not ו, as indicated in many poskim. Also, many poskim maintain that the man won’t be concerned about the fact that the ו will disclose what happened.  Regardless, often it’s likely she won’t disclose to her parents what happened, due to fear of retribution, or other reasons.

Take off the cover from a yogurt
Open the plastic from individually wrapped pieces of sliced American cheese

One should avoid opening or separating a bag/container sealed with glue, such as the items you mention in the question.
There are some lenient views when the item being opened is disposable and will be thrown away immediately (Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasa 9:4). However, it is the preferred approach to be stringent in this matter due to the concern that separating two pieces of paper or plastic stuck to each other is an issur of koreia (ripping). See Shulchan Aruch Admor Hazaken (Orach Chayim 340:17). See also Nesivim Bsdei Hashlichus vol. 2 p. 101 in the name of Rav Zalman Shimon Dvorkin Z”L.
A simple alternative would be to make a cut from the side, provided that you are not ripping any words or pictures.
This is only if it’s sealed with glue, but if it is just plain heat sealed – which is very common with today’s packaging – there won’t be an issue (especially with disposable packaging), though it’s still preferable to open it before Shabbos.

Is there a way to know which packaging is heat-sealed and which is glued? How are chips bags sealed, for example?
Answer:
I can’t say with certainty. However, if upon opening you see a thin layer of dried glue or any other sticky substances you would know it’s glued. In contrast, potato chips and most bags are usually heat sealed.","###question

Do I need to wash on Shabbos day If I don’t want to? It’s too heavy etc….,"
Eating Challa by the Shabbos meals is of primary importance and should be practiced, unless there is a medical consideration.
The required amount per meal is only slightly more than the volume of an egg (see note1) and thus a healthy person shouldn’t feel too heavy from eating just that amount.
If there is a concern that one might not feel well (aside for usual tiredness) after eating this minimal amount, or it would cause pain, there would then be place to advise an alternative to eating an K’beitza of Challah, as there may be a medical consideration to take into account. In this case, one can suffice with eating only one Kazayis of bread. (Shulchan Aruch Admor Hazaken Orach Chayim 274:6.)
Additionally, there is the view of the Maharil (the Alter Rebbe’s brother) who testified that towards the end of his life the Alter Rebbe changed his earlier ruling and said that one fulfills the obligation of a “Seudah” for Shabbos also with Mezonos. This would only apply to baked Mezonos foods (ם ו מו), foods that when affixing a meal on it and eating the requisite amount would acquire the Bracha of Hamotzi. However this should only be relied on in cases of great need, not under ordinary circumstances.","###question

If that is not possible you may soak it in cold water, however care must be taken not to soak it for 24 hours long, and that it it does NOT dissolve in the water. One should make sure to only soak pieces of matzah which are at least the volume of a kezais, not less.
In a case where you cannot eat even matzah soaked in water and soaking it in wine or other drinks helps, one may do so. It should be pointed out that this solution is only as a last resort. Healthy people who have eaten the matzo soaked in liquids other than water must eat again another kezayis of matzah.","###question

" I left a bottle of wine on my desk overnight, Can I use it?
Full Question:
I left non mevushal wine in an open brown bag on my desk in school overnight. There are non Jewish janitors that clean the room each day after everyone leaves.
Can I use the wine or should I throw it out?","
If the wine is still sealed, or if it certainly wasn’t touched (and seen) by a non-Jew (i.e., it is clear that it remained inside the bag the entire time), it is permissible.
Otherwise, if it’s known that the wine was touched by a non-Jew, it should not be used and it must be discarded.
If it was merely seen by a non-Jew, it is permitted, but some have a stringency not to use it for kiddush or other kos shel bracha. Many chassidim practice this stringency. Others are particular not to use at all.

 What is the earliest one can Daven Maariv on Motzei Shabbos when it is the first night of Yom Tov such as Pesach this year?,"Tzeis Shabbos occurs at Tzeis Kochavim Ketanim, and the Shiur of Tosfos Shabbos is several minutes later (see Seder Hachnasas Shabbos. Cf. Alter Rebbe’s Shulchon Aruch (OC 293:1) who writes until Kochavim Ketanim can be seen close together).
Maariv should not begin before this time so as not to cause community/family members to start any Melacha/Hachana before that time.
This time is after the Zman of 6.6 degrees plus 4 minutes. In 770, the minhag is to always wait  until 43 flat minutes after sunset. In many places, the accepted practice is to wait until the Zman of 8.5 degrees, in order to end Shabbos uniformly with many other Kehillos that end at that time.
The common custom is to wait the same amount of time when Yom Tov falls on Motzei Shabbos (and on the second night of Yom Tov as well) whether it is on a Motzei Shabbos or regular weekday night.
Maariv may be done from Plag Hamincha only in real cases of Ones or Shaas Hadchak. Otherwise, it should not be davened until the time that Shabbos is taken out.

One should clean the spout, faucet and hose very well, and wait 24 hours.
Afterwards, one should turn the water of the faucet in the highest temperature, extend the faucet and placed it entirely in a boiling pot of water for brief moment – using the method of Hagaalah. Don’t leave it too long because it might ruin the hose.
The parts that can’t go into the pot should be kashered via Irui – pouring boiling water over it.

Is there a way to fulfill the inyan of learning a daf of sotah every day of sefira and at the same time save the last part of daf 49 (on erev shavuos) to do the siyum much later (such as during the 9 days)?,"
If you are just making the Siyum celebration on a later date, in order to add in Kavod Hatorah, that is okay, even if you finished earlier.
But for it to be considered a seudas mitzvah (for example to allow meat and wine in the nine days, or to fulfill the Rebbe’s directive to make siyumim in the nine days), then you will have to leave a few lines to learn then. If you do so, however, you will not be fulfilling the custom of concluding it before Shavuos.

Is there a problem to begin the Shabbos meal before counting Sefira?,"
Indeed this is a problem. This applies Friday night and during the week as well.
One may not start a meal half an hour before the time of sefira, i.e., half an hour before sunset. It is only permissible to do so if there is someone who is not eating who will remind everyone about sefira. Some say even that is not sufficient.
It should be noted that despite the fact that there are those who say that according to kabalah one should count sefira after the seder, the Alter Rebbe was not in favor of this, aside for the halacha against eating before sefira, due to the concern that one might forget to count altogether.

" What are the Halachic limitations as to whom, and for what price, one may sell a house to in a Frum neighborhood?","Fuller Picture:
We live in a place where the real estate market is rapidly outpacing previous prices, as such the most common way of selling a house is to put it on the open market and sell to the highest bidder in a blind auction.
There are many non-jews (mostly peaceful goyim) interested in this neighborhood and also many frum Yidden together with non-frum Yidden.
Questions:
Could there be an issue of ו when seeling to a yid for price higher than previously established in this market?
Under what conditions is one Halachicly allowed to sell to a goy?
To which Yiddishe bidder would   מ apply?
What are the conditions for selling to another yid over the bar-metzra?
I understand that generally, you need to offer the yid/bar-metzra a chance to match the price of the other offers:
A. Does the matching price have to be to the exact dollar?
B. As mentioned the common practice is to do a blind auction where each bidder doesn’t know how much the others bid they can only be told that someone else is higher: is one obligated to tell the yid/bar-metzra the exact price that has been offered by the competition?
Answers:
In general, yes, but prices of real estate fluctuate tremendously, so it would be hard to determine a standard price.
One should not sell to a goy in a Yiddishe neighborhood, though you are not required to incur a loss by selling to a Jew.
Someone whose property connects.
Basically, if the non-neighbor is offering a higher price, or if any other loss will be incurred by selling to the neighbor. Important to point out that the Din of Bar Metzra, is on the buyer not on the seller.
A. Yes. B. You have no such obligation, especially if it’s between two Jews.","###question

" Can a Man Daven in the Women’s Section?
Aside from the uncomfortable feelings of showing up at shul and seeing men on the women’s side… Is it even halachically allowed for men to Daven on the women’s side when no women are yet present, and what about when they do show up, does halacha require them to move?","
A man is Halachically allowed to Daven in the women’s section as long as no women are present. If he knows that women are arriving soon, he should leave beforehand, and certainly once a woman arrives he must leave immediately. The exact arrangements should be worked out with the Rav and Gabai of the Shul.
Whether the man may be counted as part of the Minyan is a matter of dispute and depends largely on the setup of the Mechitza. Additionally, according to some opinions, the Women’s section is of lesser holiness than the rest of the Shul, although it would seem that this too depends if it’s the same room or not.

" Is it halachically forbidden to give away parts of Eretz Yisroel to the Arabs?
I don’t doubt the Rebbe’s words for a second, I am only asking so I can understand and explain to others:
We can’t give away parts of Eretz Yisroel because this is something that Hashem gave to us, the Jewish people. This is in short, I think, the Rebbe’s view on the topic. If so, how is this a reason for not giving away land? If someone gives me something, it is mine completely and I can do with it as I wish. If we were given Ba’alus over Eretz Yisroel, why can’t we give parts of or the whole land away? And if we don’t have such ability to do so, then what kind of gift is this?","
Here are a few points to consider:
Eretz Yisroel was given to every single Jew, thus no government can decide to give it away.
Giving away parts of Eretz Yisroel affects the safety of those living there. This has been corroborated by military experts and is evident by the rockets being fired now, which would not reach so far if those areas were still populated by Jews. The Rebbe often quoted Shulchan Aruch 329, from where we can see the importance of cities near the border.
Giving away parts of Eretz Yisroel displays a sign of weakness. It’s not a struggle about the land per se, rather it’s about our very existence. Any withdrawal from land is a withdrawal on our rights to exist as the Jewish People.","###question

" Does it matter which edition I use to learn the daily Rambam?
I know that when it comes to the hakdama (introduction) of the Rambam we don’t use the Rambam Le’am edition for the daily shiur.
My question is about the Seder Hatefillah, I know there are different versions in the various editions, which one is the best one to use? Because some are much shorter than the other. And do we know the Rebbe’s personal custom?","
The reason many don’t use the Rambam Le’am for the first few shiurim of the cycle, is because it combines the counting of mitzvos (with  their sources in the Torah) with the order of Halachos, even though they were written separately and are supposed to be learned on separate days. (First all the positive mitzvos with their p’sukim, followed by all negative mitzvos with their p’sukim, and then all mitzvos (positive and negative) as they are set up in the order of the Rambam, without the p’sukim).
Regarding the Seder Hatefillah: Generally, Kisvei Yad Teiman are known to be most accurate. The Kapach, Shilat (Rambam Meduyak), Makbili (Mifal Mishnah Torah), and Even Yisroel (Steinsaltz, Mishnah Torah Hamevuar) follow these manuscripts, with slight variation from one to another.
Nonetheless, the reality is that the printed versions are the ones which were accepted throughout Klal Yisroel and were studied by Gedolei Yisroel over the generations.
I don’t think it’s possible to know with certainty the Rebbe’s personal custom. The Rebbe was seen in public many times with the Rambam Le’am (and sometimes with a regular Rambam).
In sichos, the Rebbe discusses both the printed version as well as the Yemenite manuscripts. Often, the Rebbe gives preference for one over the other, depending on the context.
Incidentally, when it comes to Seder Hatefillah, the Rebbe points out that in the manuscript of Sefer Ahavah (knows as Sefer Hachasum, which is the basis for the Rambam Meduyak) which was edited by the Rambam, the book concludes with Hilchos Milah, and Seder Hatefillah is an addendum after the conclusion of the Sefer.","###question

The reason many don’t use the Rambam Le’am for the first few shiurim of the cycle, is because it combines the counting of mitzvos (with  their sources in the Torah) with the order of Halachos, even though they were written separately and are supposed to be learned on separate days. (First all the positive mitzvos with their p’sukim, followed by all negative mitzvos with their p’sukim, and then all mitzvos (positive and negative) as they are set up in the order of the Rambam, without the p’sukim).
Regarding the Seder Hatefillah: Generally, Kisvei Yad Teiman are known to be most accurate. The Kapach, Shilat (Rambam Meduyak), Makbili (Mifal Mishnah Torah), and Even Yisroel (Steinsaltz, Mishnah Torah Hamevuar) follow these manuscripts, with slight variation from one to another.
Nonetheless, the reality is that the printed versions are the ones which were accepted throughout Klal Yisroel and were studied by Gedolei Yisroel over the generations.
I don’t think it’s possible to know with certainty the Rebbe’s personal custom. The Rebbe was seen in public many times with the Rambam Le’am (and sometimes with a regular Rambam).
In sichos, the Rebbe discusses both the printed version as well as the Yemenite manuscripts. Often, the Rebbe gives preference for one over the other, depending on the context.
Incidentally, when it comes to Seder Hatefillah, the Rebbe points out that in the manuscript of Sefer Ahavah (knows as Sefer Hachasum, which is the basis for the Rambam Meduyak) which was edited by the Rambam, the book concludes with Hilchos Milah, and Seder Hatefillah is an addendum after the conclusion of the Sefer."

 What is the correct way to take the three steps at the end of Shmone Esrei?,"Question 1: Regarding the three steps after Shmoneh Esrei, are they meant to be three steps, as the finishing step which makes the feet next to each other, or is it three and a fourth step to make the feet equal?
Answer 1: The common custom – and this was the Rebbe’s practice too – is to take three steps after Shemone Esrai as follows: the first step is with the left foot placed behind the right foot, then a large step with the right foot behind the left foot and then another large step with the left foot behind the right foot. After these three steps, the right foot is adjusted to be parallel to the left foot.
This applies only after Shemone Esrei.
Question 2: Regarding the steps before Shmoneh Esrei – the third step has to be the one to make one foot parallel the other? or I am able to take another step?

A Goy may turn on the fire if the cooking is being done entirely by a Yid. This means that the fire is being lit before the Yid places the pot on the stove or before the food is put in the pot which is already on the stove etc.
True there is an opinion that allows for non-Jewish workers to put on the fire in a Jewish home.

 Are siblings (brothers and sisters) allowed to dance together at a wedding?,"The Halacha is that a brother may not hug or kiss a sister or vice versa. This applies to any type of affectionate physical contact between them.
Dancing together is considered affectionate physical contact. So many poskim have decried the practice of mixed dancing due to the physical contact between the genders. It follows that brother and sister too may not have such type of physical contact. Indeed, this is spelled out clearly in a number of contemporary sources indicated below.
See also the attached from “A guide to Chabad Weddings“, recently published by Mikvah.org and approved by multiple Rabbonei Anash.
This is also why husband and wife are not to be dancing with each other in the presence of others, since dancing together is considered affectionate behavior and they are not to show their affection for each other in the presence of other people.
Furthermore, even the holy practice of mitzvah tantz was abolished in Chabad, as the Rebbe wrote, because we have seen in practice what has happened as a result of this in so many weddings. Certainly, a dance among family, not in the context of the mitzvah tantz should not be done. How much more so when this is done in the presence of other people, which creates immoral thoughts. This is in addition to the fact that naturally this means either women being in the men’s section or men being in the women’s section. Such behavior undermines the purpose of the mechitza at the wedding.","###question

Chabad Chassidim are very particular about using a bor al gabei bor mikveh wherever possible as it touches upon the very kashrus of the Mikvah. Please see more about this here.
You write that your local Mikvah is called a “bor geshomim”. Please note that “bor geshomim” means that the Mikvah is a rainwater one. It does not necessarily define the type of boros, if it’s side by side or bor al gabei bor. It could very well be that in your case the actual pool for immersion is itself comprised of pure rainwater (in addition to the rainwater bor which connects to the immersion pool). If this is the case, then this would be much better than a standard bor al gabei bor mikvah.
As explained in the link above, it is a well-accepted rule that one should strive to go to a Mikveh which is more Mehudar, bor al gabei bor, or one where the actual pool for immersion is itself comprised of pure rainwater, whenever possible practically. Otherwise, other mikvaos qualify too, even if they are bor btzad bor (side by side).
It goes without saying that this only applies where there is proper hashgachah of a reliable rov. If a mikvah has no such supervision, one shouldn’t use it regardless if it is bor al gabei bor or not.

"Move the pieces of the timer to make it turn off sooner?
Move the pieces while the appliance is off to cause it to turn on sooner?","
When an appliance is running on a timer, one is allowed to move the pieces in order to maintain the existing position. Thus, one may cause it to go off later than scheduled while it’s on, or make it go on later than scheduled while it’s off.
One is not allowed to move the pieces to change its position. Therefore, one may not
cause it to go off earlier while it’s on or make it go on earlier while it’s off.
There are timers where in order to turn off the appliance one needs to let go of the button that’s keeping it on (unlike a timer where one pushes a button or something similar), see the attached picture. In this case, may cause it go off earlier than scheduled, but not the other way around.
When moving the pieces of the timer, it is best to do it with a shinui.","###question

Out of respect, women have adopted a custom not to look at an open Torah scroll or touch a Torah scroll when they are in the state of niddah.

If for whatever reason the chazan did not start kaddish until the Sefer Torah is already being carried to the Aron Kodesh, it should be said then before Kadish.

"Chanukah, Who Should Light Menorah? 
ו"" ז
 My son is very not well and is very sensitive to light. How should he fulfill the mitzvah of Ner Chanukah?
My son is very not well and is very sensitive to light. It is also hard for him to get out of bed. For his mitzvah of Ner Chanukah, is it better for him to hear the bracha from me even if he can’t see the candles, or is it better for him to light by his room if he can only light one candle every night? (lighting more than 1 candle is too much light for him to bear.)","
In this case, he should light himself, even though it will only be one candle. Nonetheless, it is recommended that he hear the brachos from you. This way he will be part of the mehadrin min hamehadrin lighting too. This does not prevent him from making his own bracha on his own candle.","###question

Yes. Generally, government mandates that are done for the welfare of the community are halachically binding. However, if the rule has not been accepted by society at large, there is no halachic mandate to follow this rule, though it is still legally required (assuming it is within the framework of the local legal code and within the jurisdiction of whoever mandated it).

Thank you so much and have a wonderful day!!","
It’s both. While it’s origin is Spanish or Italian (Roman), it’s also a modern Hebrew name. It has become the feminine version of the Hebrew name Emanuel. The original masculine version, Emanuel has extremely ancient roots in Judaism, already in the Tanach.
While there’s nothing wrong with the name Emmanuela being that it’s currently considered a true Jewish name (despite its origin), you might perhaps consider adding another name before Emmanuela, a name with clearly identifiable Jewish origins.","###question

I am descended from the Shaloh hakadosh and my family minhag is not to eat turkey. I am now married to someone whose family does not have that minhag and I want to know if I must continue to avoid eating turkey or not? Would I need to do a hataras nedarim? My family is definitely not ben achar ben from the Shaloh if that makes a difference.,"
Indeed, not all descendants of the Shaloh have adopted this minhag. But those who have done so should continue adhering to it. Many descendants of the Shaloh follow this minhag even though they’re not ben achar ben. This proves that the minhag was kept even when marrying others who haven’t had this custom (though generally the women follows the husband’s custom).

However, if the one who was called up is prepared for shalom reasons to pardon his Aliya, the chiyuv may be oleh."

" Can I get an Aliya if I haven’t been in the Mikvah?
I heard from a lot of people that it is not appropriate to get an aliyah without going to mikva first, but I also know that many are not careful about this and most people never heard of such a thing. Is it the correct thing to do?","
According to halacha, one may receive an Aliya even without mikvah. There is room for stringency not to receive an Aliya if one requires Tevilas Ezra. Even so, if someone was already called to the Torah he shouldn’t refuse.
One may wish to extend this idea to general Mikvah, although there is no known source for this. This is a matter of hergesh.","###question

Depending on the details, it would likely be permitted based on the rule of nullification in sixty times of the non-kosher.
Kavush wouldn’t  be a problem as the kosher Slurpee’s would only absorb the taste of the Keli after 24 hours, in which case it would be Pagum.
ו״ ״ז מז, .
This question should be addressed to the certifying Hechsher, if there is one, or the agencies which produce lists of kosher Slurpee’s.
Of course, it’s always best to use Slurpee’s from a kosher certified location
From what I’ve read, but haven’t verified it myself:
99.9% of Slurpee flavors are kosher pareve. The Slurpee machine operates at 28°F, too cold for there to be any blios flavor. There are also no issues of kavush because of the high turnover of product. The flavors don’t usually sit in the machines for 24 hours. The compartment in the machine is so small that the Slurpee flavor is replaced after filling a few cups.
However, Slurpee is a registered trademark sold only at 7-Eleven stores. Other gas stations or convenience stores sell similar products but more caution is needed when purchasing from them. While 7-Eleven stores mostly use the main brands which are more likely to be kosher certified, other stores may use generic-brands that are not necessarily kosher certified. If the dispenser is shared among more than one flavor, and you cannot confirm that they are all kosher, it is recommended to run the machine until there is no residue of the previous flavor before filling your cup.

Due to technological advances the way salt is applied today this hardly is an issue, as the entire chicken is covered from salt inside and outside. Likewise our cleaning system is such that in most cases all these organs removed anyhow.

" How can I pay back for damaging items during my youth?
I’m embarrassed to say but when I was 10 or 11, our teacher gave us books in the classroom library that we could take out and use and then return. I dirtied some of the books, purposely, and it’s disgusting that I did that. It’s more than 25 years later and I want to pay back for what I did, but I don’t remember how many books it entailed (I used to read a lot, so it was probably many books), and I’m not sure if it was the teachers’ books or the schools’ books. How can I pay back?","
From the letter of the law you aren’t obligated to compensate for damages you have incurred before the age of Bar Mitzvah at all. However, beyond the letter of the law, lifnim meshuras hadin, you should compensate however much you’re able to.
Practically, you should try reaching out (anonymously) to the teacher to see if they remember whose books they were and compensate them until they forgive you.
Otherwise, you should make a donation to the school in a amount which is approximately the amount you estimate the damage.","###question

 When should one eat Matzah on Pesach Sheni?,"The main custom is to eat Matza during a meal of the daytime, on the 14th of Iyar. (This year, since it’s Erev Shabbos, one should make sure to begin such meal before the 10th Halachic hour of the day).
In some places, however, the Rebbe cites the Minhag also in regards to the night of the 15th (the time when the Korban was eaten in the times of the Beis Hamikdash).
It’s recorded in some places that the Rebbe ate the Matzah on the day of the 14th or – sometimes and – on the night of the 15th. (There were a few exceptions, such as when Pesach Sheini would be on a Taanis Behab, or when the Rebbe went to the Ohel).
[To note also that it’s recorded that on Pesach Sheini 5712 – a Friday, and the day after the passing of the Rebbe’s brother, R. Yisroel Aryeh Leib – the Rebbe washed for a meal and ate from the Matzah that was baked on Erev Pesach (even though generally the Rebbe would not wash for a meal on Erev Shabbos).]
Additionally, in the Sicha of Shabbos Parahas Shmini 5740 (not Muga), it’s recorded that the Rebbe mentioned the different customs on this (such as eating on the night/day/afternoon of the 14th), and stated that those who wish to be Mehader (scrupulous) eat on all these 3 occasions, as well as on the days before and after Pesach Sheini.

P.S. Note however the following story about the Rebbe’s behavior, even at a time of obvious danger:
“The French government issued a call for every able-bodied man to register for army service. The Rebbe reported to the draft office and was given a certificate attesting to his willingness to serve. Although he was never summoned for military duty, this certificate proved very useful. For he was frequently stopped in the street and asked to prove his identity and to show that he was not a draft-evader. When the Nazis entered Paris, they immediately ordered a census of all the inhabitants, including information regarding their race and religion. When they came to the Rebbe’s apartment, he was not home. Since their intent was obvious, when asked regarding their religion, one of the people staying in the apartment answered, “Orthodox.” This was not a lie, because it could have been interpreted as “Orthodox Jews.” Nevertheless, the implication was “Russian Orthodox.” When the Rebbe returned and heard of this, he hurried to the census office and asked to correct the matter by adding the word “Jew.”

Even afterwards, there would be no problem with just saying tehillim, as the issue is only when Davening specifically that the results should be good. If one davens that the individual should have a refuah, it would not be an issue."

As long as it is noticeable, without looking in depth.
When in doubt, it is considered not noticeable.
Some experts claim there’s a way to tell. Naturally, there’s always a hole on the top of the lulav. If you can see the hole completely through a magnifying glass, it is obvious that it wasn’t chopped off. Another way is to see that the brown all around it is complete.","###question

"I do a lot of street-mivtzoim throughout sukkos and at times when people are rushing I tell them just to hold the lulav and esrog together.

My question is: are they still ו or do they have to be fully holding the lulav and esrog on their own?","
There are several issues here:
The requirement of taking lulav. They need to close their fingers or even better lift it. At the very least, according to some opinions, holding it in such a way that it doesn’t fall is also considered taking.
The fact that two people are holding it together: If they hold in such a way that without your support it would not fall and you are just assisting, and reversely, without them holding it, it would fall, it is valid. Otherwise, they should hold it on their own.
There is an issue of kavanah, since the person is just holding it without being conscious of the fact that they are doing a mitzvah. This is only an issue on the first day. (See link below)
Likewise, it might not be considered a kinyan and therefore not theirs. This also is only an issue on the first day, and ideally one should be concerned about this on the second day too.","###question

" What are the guidelines that would make a concert “kosher”?
My children like music. They express interest in attending concerts. I only feel comfortable if there is no mixed seating. Even if there isn’t mixed seating, something about it just doesn’t sit right.
I was recently at a concert for the first time. There was an option for separate seating, which we chose. Women were singing along all together out loud, some were dancing. There was no mechitza. I did not feel comfortable with it. But maybe there is a heter for this as the room is dark, and its many girls singing together?… and maybe according to the basic halacha it is ok? and just if you want to be extra stringent it’s a problem?
Am I being overly machmir with my sense of discomfort?
It seems every day there is another concert popping up somewhere and it would be helpful for me to know what Halacha say about this, in case an opportunity arises again in the future.

Are men and women allowed to sit together? (At a concert, event, etc.) 
Specifically, regarding concerts, note the following answers from the Rebbe:
1.
In 5748, HASC planned its first “A Time for Music” benefit concert and invited MBD to perform. He agreed on condition that the performance will have separate seating across the whole hall, but the organizers were worried that such an arrangement will cause many people to avoid the concert. MBD offered to go with them to “Sunday Dollars” by the Rebbe and ask the Rebbe for a blessing, asking that the concert be successful despite the separate seating.
The next Sunday the HASC organizers arrived in 770 together with MBD, and after MBD introduced them to the Rebbe he mentioned that they agreed to make the concert with separate seating, and they want a blessing for success. The Rebbe gave them a blessing and the preparations for the concert began.
A few days before the concert was due to take place the organizers were worried, very few tickets were sold, and people said it was because of the separate seating. One of the organizers came up with an idea, to have mixed seating but call it “Family Seating,” thus skirting the Halachic requirement for separate seating. But MBD was steadfast in his refusal and asked the organizers to write to the Rebbe about the problems and their idea. The Rebbe replied:

There are a number of options. We will list them, in order of priority, the first being the best choice:
The husband only lights the candles. He must be mekabel Shabbos within 10 minutes of candle lighting.
The wife may – in addition to the husband’s lighting – light in the mikvah, or somewhere near the mikvah, provided someone will use the candles for eating purposes there.
She may light candles at home and make a stipulation not to accept Shabbos. She or her husband would still have to accept Shabbos within 10 minutes of lighting.","###question

Chatzos is Fast approaching, what is preferred: Daven very fast or skip and have Kavana?
Does the same apply to an instance if וף זמן  is approaching?
And if not, why?","
From a strict halachic standpoint, it would be basically the same thing.
Chassidim are more lenient due to their emphasis on Kavana.
Question:
What are the parameters of Zeman tefillah?
I am not addressing Chatzos, but sof zeman tefillah.
What about minyan?
E.g. if one is about to leave home to shul and then realizes that if he goes to shul/minyan he’ll miss Zman Tefilla?
What about  ז? What about someone who’s showering in place of  ז?
What about Tallis and/or Tefillin?
E.g. one who’s on a plane or train and the Zman is approaching but he’s not in a position yet that he is comfortable donning T/T.
What about Slichos in the month of Ellul? (Daven before וז”, or first say Slichos)
Surely (if I understand correctly) all of these instances are  not a question when it comes to chatzos. My question then pertains to וף זמן .
Answer:
Zeman tefillah should be kept lchatchillah. Only bedieved is one yotze if davening after zeman tefillah. Nonetheless, if it will affect his kavanah, Chassidim are lenient, since kavanah is fundamental to davening.
Thus, tefillah btzibur, tallis/tefillin, selichos etc. do not override zeman tefillah.
There is a machlokes regarding tevilas ezra, in the case where someone observes it regularly.","###question

" May I put a frozen bag of vegetables etc. on my body on Shabbos as it might melt from my body heat?
If the answer is yes, may I cool myself off with these packets of frozen milk knowing and benefiting from the fact that they will melt? If neither of these are acceptable,may I use a cold cloth placed in the freezer?","
1) One may handle ice packs to cool off with, since only a small amount of water is melted, there is no intention of melting them and the melted water is going to waste. Melting ice is problematic when one actively melts it, or even when no action is taken if this his intention, for example if wants to melt it save the melted water – which is not applicable in this case.
However, frozen food items like meat and vegetables should not be used since they are muktzah.
2) Since you want to melt the milk, you should not purposely use it to cool off so as to proactively melt it.
3) Cold towels that are not wet and will not become squeezed is permissible to use.","###question

" Can I get a heter to be intimate with my husband during the day?
Hi, I am nine months pregnant and too tired most of the time to be intimate at night. Can I get a heter to be intimate with my husband during the day?","
According to halacha, relations must be at night or even after break of dawn until it’s light enough where people can recognize each other (misheyakir), the time when one may put on tefillin, provided it’s dark. This affects also the mazal as well as the neshama of the child born from these relations.
Ideally, you should attempt to do the same, but where this proves very difficult, and particularly in your case of pregnancy where it’s not for the purpose of conception, there is room for leniency. However, you should ensure that the room is completely dark, or at least cover yourself completely with a blanket that no light enters. If possible, one should schedule relations for Shabbos day.","###question

 Does one need to ask a Rav before being induced? Is there any Halachic issue?,"
This matter is discussed in a number of Poskim. The general rule is that one may not induce or rush the onset of labor unless there are clear medical reasons to require it. Some of the reasons for this prohibition are because:
There is a level of risk inherent to childbirth, and one should therefore not hasten it even though it is bound to come.
The special assurance of protection Hashem provides at the time of childbirth does not necessarily apply to the same degree if the birth is hastened without a clear medical need.
The procedures and/or medicines involved in induction can themselves cause complications, and one should not take that risk needlessly.","###question
