" May I put a frozen bag of vegetables etc. on my body on Shabbos as it might melt from my body heat?
If the answer is yes, may I cool myself off with these packets of frozen milk knowing and benefiting from the fact that they will melt? If neither of these are acceptable,may I use a cold cloth placed in the freezer?","
1) One may handle ice packs to cool off with, since only a small amount of water is melted, there is no intention of melting them and the melted water is going to waste. Melting ice is problematic when one actively melts it, or even when no action is taken if this his intention, for example if wants to melt it save the melted water – which is not applicable in this case.
However, frozen food items like meat and vegetables should not be used since they are muktzah.
2) Since you want to melt the milk, you should not purposely use it to cool off so as to proactively melt it.
3) Cold towels that are not wet and will not become squeezed is permissible to use.","###question

" Can I get a heter to be intimate with my husband during the day?
Hi, I am nine months pregnant and too tired most of the time to be intimate at night. Can I get a heter to be intimate with my husband during the day?","
According to halacha, relations must be at night or even after break of dawn until it’s light enough where people can recognize each other (misheyakir), the time when one may put on tefillin, provided it’s dark. This affects also the mazal as well as the neshama of the child born from these relations.
Ideally, you should attempt to do the same, but where this proves very difficult, and particularly in your case of pregnancy where it’s not for the purpose of conception, there is room for leniency. However, you should ensure that the room is completely dark, or at least cover yourself completely with a blanket that no light enters. If possible, one should schedule relations for Shabbos day.","###question

 Does one need to ask a Rav before being induced? Is there any Halachic issue?,"
This matter is discussed in a number of Poskim. The general rule is that one may not induce or rush the onset of labor unless there are clear medical reasons to require it. Some of the reasons for this prohibition are because:
There is a level of risk inherent to childbirth, and one should therefore not hasten it even though it is bound to come.
The special assurance of protection Hashem provides at the time of childbirth does not necessarily apply to the same degree if the birth is hastened without a clear medical need.
The procedures and/or medicines involved in induction can themselves cause complications, and one should not take that risk needlessly.","###question

 What are the Halachos of Yichud when using Uber? ,"Uber:
Almost all of the Halachos of driving a regular car apply to a taxi or Uber, i.e. one may travel when it is lit up and during the time when there are people in the street (on those streets), and the windows are not tinted in a way that someone can’t see into the car.(ראה שערים מצויינים בהלכה סי’ קנב ס”ק ג)
However, there are those that are Machmir and hold that wherever possible, one should not travel with a non-Jew or a ‘Parutz’ even by day  (ראה מנחת איש פרק יז ה’ ד). With an Uber there is more room for leniency, as there are governing laws of the company for drivers, with GPS monitoring.
Parutz:
There is a Machlokes in Poskim how to define a Parutz. One must be especially careful in this regard when exposed to Yichud on a regular basis, such as in a workplace.
It is clear that a person who is not particular with the Issur of Kriva L’arayos and does not keep the guidelines of Tznius, even if he otherwise a Shomer Torah U’mitzvos, is  certainly considered  a Parutz. For example, a man who has no inhibitions about embracing women or girls, one who regularly watches television, reads unsuitable material, frequents indecent chat rooms on the internet, or visits movie theaters is considered a Parutz. The mere exposure to immodesty affects their morality. See Toras HaYichud 3:2:4. Shevet Halevi Vol. 5:202:1.
A man whose business dealings are questionable might be considered a Parutz in relation to Yichud — see Nitei Gavriel Yichud 22:9.
Furthermore, the average non-observant Jew is to be considered a Parutz too. The Tzemach Tzedek E”H 39 rules, that the definition of Anashim Ksheirim is one who has a special Chezkas Kashrus, such as a Talmid Chacham, and the standard Chezkas Kashrus of all Klal Yisroel isn’t sufficient. It seems that it need not be Mamosh a Talmid Chacham; it could be a Yeshiva Bachur etc., but it is not enough that we are not aware of any Pritzus behavior. See also Nitei Gavriel Yichud 19:3,10.

Our son was born on 19 Iyar. This year Erev Shavuos is on Shabbos. When should we make the Upshernish – on Friday 4 of Sivan or Tuesday Isru Chag?,"
• Generally:
For a child whose birthday is from after Lag Baomer until Erev Shavuos, the Upshernish haircut should take place on Erev Shavuos. [When Erev Shavuos falls on Shabbos – on 4 Sivan (with the exception of someone whose birthday is on Erev Shavuos, in which case it should be postponed until after Shavuos)].

https://asktherav.com/13133-when-should-a-boy-start-wearing-kippa-and-tzitzis/
• However, regarding someone whose birthday is on 19 Iyar, a day after Lag Baomer:
There are instructions from the Rebbe to perform the haircut on Lag Baomer.
While in most places it appears that it should take place on Lag Baomer itself (during the day), a day before the child turns 3, others record that it should be done on the actual birthday, right after nightfall on the night after Lag Baomer.
See here the testimony of three people who were all instructed by the Rebbe to do it on Lag Baomer: R. SB Popak, R. YY Hecht and R. Refoel Hartman. In the case of R. Hecht, the Rebbe himself did the cutting. (This information has been independently verified by us). In the case of R. Hartman, we have the actual answer of the Rebbe.
Independent of the above, there is yet another directive presented regarding the Upshernish of Ari Halberstam hy”d (whose birthday is on 19 Iyar), of which there are pictures of the Rebbe cutting the hair. See in the Hebrew references below.
This account raises several questions. Regardless, I feel there is enough information to rely upon to do it on Lag Baomer (by day).","###question

"I do a lot of street-mivtzoim throughout sukkos and at times when people are rushing I tell them just to hold the lulav and esrog together. Sometimes they do it but don’t get full grasp, so I have to hold it together with them (to assure it doesn’t fall). My question is: are they still יוצא or do they have to be fully holding the lulav and esrog on their own?","
There are several issues here:
The requirement of taking lulav. They need to close their fingers or even better lift it. At the very least, according to some opinions, holding it in such a way that it doesn’t fall is also considered taking.
The fact that two people are holding it together: If they hold in such a way that without your support it would not fall and you are just assisting, and reversely, without them holding it, it would fall, it is valid. Otherwise, they should hold it on their own.
There is an issue of kavanah, since the person is just holding it without being conscious of the fact that they are doing a mitzvah. This is only an issue on the first day. (See link below)
Likewise, it might not be considered a kinyan and therefore not theirs. This also is only an issue on the first day, and ideally one should be concerned about this on the second day too.","###question

 Is an oven with Cook-time or Stop-time Mode acceptable for Shabbos use?,"There are many ovens on the market, and it is impossible in this short space to investigate and address every single model. The best we can do is provide a summary of the many issues to look out for. It is important that you read through the manuals of any model you are considering for purchase, in order to determine whether, and to what degree, the issues outlined below apply.
Thermostat:
The main problem with using a oven on Shabbos is the thermostat, which is affected by opening or closing the oven while the oven is on. When the oven door is opened, the thermostat will detect the cold air that rushes in and will activate the heating element if it is off at that moment. It is forbidden to cause this to occur, even if all the food will be removed all at once before the oven door is re-closed. [If the oven door is re-closed with some of the food remaining inside, there may be additional concerns of Bishul on Shabbos, depending on the circumstances.]  The thermostat is not a concern for Yom Tov use, but there are additional problems with a oven on Yom Tov as detailed below.
If the oven is off, like after the cook-time or stop time has finished this would not be an issue.
the problem with using such an oven on Yom Tov is primarily a practical one; most modern ovens have an auto shut-off feature that turns the oven off after around 6-12 hours. Yet another problem, applicable on both Shabbos and Yom Tov, is that many models have lights or fans that are activated and deactivated as the door is opened or closed. In summary, a modern oven without Sabbath Mode may be completely unusable on Shabbos and Yom Tov.
Ovens with “Sabbath Mode”:
Buying an oven with Sabbath Mode will alleviate many of these problems. Sabbath Mode will generally disable the oven’s display panel and any electronic controls, as well as disengage the fans and lights from being activated by opening and closing the oven door. The Sabbath Mode feature will also disable the auto shut-off feature. However, one very big problem, at least with regards to most models, is that the thermostat usually remains operative. [Some ovens have a light which illuminates when the heating element is on, in which case the oven could theoretically be opened when the light is on. However, it has been demonstrated through rigorous testing that these indicator lights are generally inaccurate, and may be illuminated even when the heating element is off.]
The thermostat does not present a problem for Yom Tov use, but makes it completely forbidden on Shabbos, according to most opinions. The outcome is that, ironically, the Sabbath Mode oven remains forbidden for Shabbos use, and is permitted only on Yom Tov. Perhaps it would have been more apt to name this feature “Yom Tov Mode”.
There is a practical workaround for Shabbos use that is easy and simple: Estimate about what time the main course will be served, and make sure that the oven turns off before then. This is generally easy to achieve, as the Sabbath Mode feature can usually be set to turn the oven off in any increment amount of time up until 72 or 96 hours. So, you can easily set the oven to go off after 2 or 3 hours, for example. Once the oven is off, opening the door does not create a problem with regards to the thermostat.
However, this method will usually create a new problem, which requires its own workaround. Now that the oven is off, this means that Sabbath Mode is now deactivated as well, and opening the door will turn the light on (if the oven has a light). This can be circumvented before Shabbos by manipulating the magnets or levers that detect whether the door is open. The specific manner of circumvention will vary from model to model, and in the case of magnetic detectors, may take some trial-and-error. Some oven doors are designed to be taken apart to allow proper cleaning of all the glass panes, and the magnet can be physically removed from the door. In other models, it may work to place a strong and thin magnet on the oven wall at the correct place.(The location of the oven’s magnet can usually be detected by sliding a paperclip around the top of the oven door.) These options may or may not work, depending on the model, so you would have to try before Shabbos, when you have the time and patience to troubleshoot it. [Note: Disabling the magnetic sensor only helps with regards to the functions controlled by the door sensor, such as the oven light and fans. However, the thermostat is not controlled by the door sensor, which is why the oven needs to be off before opening the door on Shabbos.]
Following the advice above, when Shabbos is followed by Yom Tov, one would have to choose whether to reserve the oven’s use for Shabbos or Yom Tov, as using it on Shabbos would require the oven to be set to turn off on Shabbos, in which case it will remain off for the duration of Yom Tov as well.
The Issur of Sheiyah with regards to an oven:
The above answer focuses purely on using the oven itself. However, there are also restrictions about which foods may be placed in an oven before Shabbos without a Blech, and much discussion about whether, and how, a Blech can be facilitated in an oven. Here is a brief summary of the issues:
From the Torah perspective, one may place food over an open flame before Shabbos in order that it cooks on Shabbos. Nevertheless, Chazal forbade this due to the concern that a person may come to stoke the fire on Shabbos in order to speed up the cooking process. This prohibition is knownas Shehiya.
One method of avoiding Shehiya is to cover the flames, typically with a Blech. Covering the fire indicates that one does not desire a strong flame, it diverts his attention from the fire, and it serves as a reminder not to increase the flames. With regards to an oven, there is a dispute whether – and how – a Blech can be adequately created. In practice, a Blech in an oven should be situated so that it covers the heating elements, which may be located either at the top of the oven, the bottom or the backwall. In many ovens, there are heating elements in all of these places.
Another way of addressing Shehiya, and to sidestep the need for a Blech, is to ensure that the food is cooked prior to Shabbos. It is sufficient if the food is already half cooked.  This fraction does not represent time, but rather, is qualitative and measured against the degree of cooking most people would regard as fully cooked. Nevertheless, for a number of reasons, it is best that the food be fully baked before Shabbos.
There is yet a third possible way to circumvent the prohibition of Shehiya. Chazal allowed one to put completely raw meat on an open flame just before the onset of Shabbos. They were not concerned that one might come to stoke the flames, because doing so would not serve any productive purpose – it would not ready the meat in time for the Friday night meal, nor would it be necessary to ready the meat in time for the Shabbos day meal. This leniency is known as “Kidra Chaysa” – literally: raw pot. (Indeed, some people may wish to put raw chicken and rice right before Shabbos to slow bake in the oven for the daytime Seudas Shabbos.)
In order for this leniency to apply, two criteria must be met. First, the food item must be one that takes a relatively long time to cook properly (such as meat). Second, the food must be put on the fire just before Shabbos, late enough that it will not begin cooking before Shabbos comes in. Some contemporary Poskim therefore assert that this leniency seldom applies nowadays, because most modern cooking appliances are able to cook in a relatively short amount of time. As a case in point, meat put up to cook rightat the  onset of Shabbos would usually be fit for consumption by the time the meat course  arrives. Even if the heat is set to low, this does not diminish the oven’s overall ability to bake quickly, because the seat heating can be easily raised. Thus, according to these Poskim, this option is not applicable to a modern oven.
Other associated issues:
1. It should be pointed out that even when the oven is off and cold, if it will be turned on with a Shabbos clock or a timer (see next point), one may not place inside any food which is not completely cooked. Furthermore, even completely cooked food that has cooled down may not be placed inside either, unless the food is completely dry (and will remain dry when heated). The same applies to an oven which will remain off but has  not yet cooled down.
2. With regards to Shabbos clocks in general, the Rebbe writes in a letter (Igros Kodesh Vol 12 page 192): “There are those who are extremely stringent and are even sceptical about the permissibility of using a Shabbos clock… Therefore, I am abstaining from giving this idea in an official capacity.” Even so, it is reported that the Rebbe instructed some individuals that they may be used (See Shulchan Menachem Volume 2 page 173).  At the same time, many authorities who permit Shabbos clocks in general nevertheless rule that they should not be used with regards to cooking specifically, for a number of reasons.

" Can giving money towards a Kallahs gifts before her wedding (bridal shower), be taken from Tzedaka money (Maasar)?
Asking regarding friends, as well as acquaintances that I wouldn’t necessarily buy a gift for, but want to help towards their marriage.","
One may use maaser to buy a gift for a chosson/kallah, provided that the following conditions are in place:
The chosson/kallah are considered poor and eligible to receive maaser.
It’s not an expected norm that people give gifts to chosson/kallah.
You have not already resolved to give a gift, prior to your thought of using maaser money.
See also:
Can I use Maaser money towards airfare to go to a friend’s wedding?
Follow-up Questions:
1. What makes someone “poor”? Many people do not have enough money to pull off wedding expenses…
2. While it can be the norm to give gifts, one doesn’t MUST give a gift, so a gift might be given with only the intention of helping the kallah who needs it. (Or to make her happy).  Does that count?
3. On another note, does maasar need to be given from the monthly interest earned from the bank?
Answers:
1. Each case can be different. The general rule is if someone’s salary doesn’t cover their expenses for that year they may take tzedakah. For example if he makes $1,500 a month and it cost him $2,000 a month to live he will be able to collect the $500 from tzedakah.
צדקה ומשפט פרק ב’ הע’ י.
While it is true many people do not have enough money to pull off wedding expenses and they would be halachicly permitted to take from tzedakah, some choose instead to take a loan and when things are easier and there are less expenses they pay back that loan at a slower pace rather than take tzedakah. Obviously the latter is the preferred option if possible. But if it’s not possible as mentioned above they would be permitted to take money from tzedakah for the wedding.
2. A simple test to determine this would be: ask yourself whether you would give the gift if you wouldn’t be able to use maaser funds for it. If the answer is yes then you wouldn’t be able to use maaser funds for the gift, if not you would be able to use maaser funds. If you would have bought a cheaper gift then the difference would be able to come from maaser.

" Can a lady give a Shiur to men?
Full Question:
I run a lunch and learn in my office, the crowd is mixed and diverse, and we bring different speakers every week. It was suggested from our main sponsor to have a lady (who is fully Frum and Tznius) to give the Shiur/lecture. Is this permissible? Obviously, I am in a sensitive position. If the answer is in the negative, I would need to present it to the local rabbinic authority, and present the sources in Halacha.","
This is not proper for a religious crowd. Poskim advise against this. (Men need to look at the speaker, and to have men looking at a woman speak for a long period of time is not Tznius. We find in the Poskim that by the age of 9, it is important to have only male teachers).
Some poskim even forbid it outright.

However, if the crowd is not religious, and the purpose is to teach them Torah, there could be some room for leniency in very specific scenarios, and one should seek guidance from a Rav.","###question

 May one interrupt while reading Shnayim Mikra?,"The Alter Rebbe (OC 285:6) states that some are accustomed to read the entire week’ s Shnayim Mikra without interruption at all, but that according to the basic Halacha, one may interrupt it and read “one Parsha today . . and another Parsha tomorrow”. [In this context, Parsha refers to a segment of Pesukim in the Torah that appears without any space between the Pesukim, also known as פתוחות וסתומות.]
This implies that if one does not wish to read the entire week’s Shnayim Mikra at once, he may interrupt only when there is a break in the Torah between Parshiyos.
From this it can be inferred that:
1. It is ideal to read the entire week’s Shnayim Mikra without interruption at all.
2. It is acceptable to pause when there is a break in the Torah between Parshiyos.
3. One should not interrupt within a Parsha at all.
Although point 3 is only implicit in the Alter Rebbe, the Mishna Brura (Shaar Hatziyon 285:11) states this explicitly.

" How can I enter my building on Shabbos if the door can only be opened with an electric key?
I need an electric key to enter the building I live in (attached is a picture of the key). On Shabbos, they try to put something in the door that it shouldn’t lock, sometimes though some גוים from the building take it out and it gets locked. The question therefore is:
1. Can one carry this key on their bendel on Shabbos?
2. Can one give the key on Shabbos to a goy passing by (and ask them) to open the door
Note, there is no other way to enter the building!","
The key is Muktzah given that its primary purpose cannot be used for Shabbos. It therefore cannot be touched with one’s hands. If it is the only key on the Bendel, you would not be able to put the Bendel on or take it off with your hands. However, you may attach the key to a Bendel which has other regular keys that are at least as significant, and the Bendel may then be put on and taken off, but without touching this actual key. [Although it would normally be ideal to remove Muktzah keys before Shabbos, this is not a requirement.]
Asking a Goy to open the door for you, would be permitted, being that it is a Psik Reisha. Also, it is a Shevus Dshevus in a case of reasonably great need.

Asking a Goy to open the door for you, would be permitted, being that it is a Psik Reisha. Also, it is a Shevus Dshevus in a case of reasonably great need.

 Am I allowed to eat in a married woman’s kitchen if she does not cover her hair?,"This depends on various factors. Firstly, do you know if she keeps the basic kosher standards that are not necessarily kept by all kosher consumers such as: Cholov Yisrael and Pas Yisrael, etc..? In other words, what is her official standards?
Is she knowledgeable and active in checking salads for bugs? Does she check eggs for blood spots? Does she understand that there are many hechsherim and not all of them are acceptable to Anash?
If it seems to you that her knowledge seems adequate to run a kosher kitchen to your liking, then we need to consider the second question: can you rely on her Yiras Shamayim due to the fact that she does not cover her hair?
This would depend on her upbringing. For example, if she is only starting to become frum the reason for not covering her hair might be because she knows that many Orthodox women do not cover their hair and she considers herself like one of them, (of course this is wrong, but it is her nisayon – challenge). If so, it could be acceptable to eat in her home if otherwise, her Yiras shamayim seems to be good in all other aspects.
If, however, she has had a frum upbringing and now does not cover her hair, then this is a negative reflection on her yiras shamayim. This is since there is no true justified reason she can have that she is not covering her hair.
Therefore, the matter would depend on your kosher standards and the specifics of some of the above-mentioned points to consider.","###question

" What is the minimum of Challah one can eat and still be able to wash & Bentch?
I try to keep the minhag of melave malka every week, including washing. Sometimes it’s hard to eat a lot after having eaten recently at the Shabbos meal…
What is the minimum of challah/Matzah one can eat and still be able to wash/bentch?
Over the years I’ve seen many different places where there is a weight amount or, worse yet, a description such as “kazayis” or “kabeitza” to describe food shiurim, and those leave a person very confused as to the exact amount of food. Would the Rav be so kind as to describe the size of a piece of challah or the amount of matzah (usually box Square Matzah)? (E.g. The amount of challah comparable to a golf ball or two golf balls etc or a different item that the challah could be measured against).
Additionally, does the shiur consist of only the hamotzi food, or could something that’s put on top of the challah/matzah also count as part of the shiur? (Let’s say if someone puts egg salad or tuna salad on challah, can this be counted and this way one eats let’s of the actual hamotzi food but can nevertheless still wash and bench).
And finally, is there a time frame in which one needs to eat the shiur?","
One must wash (without a Bracha) and make Hamotzi for even the smallest amount.
One must wash with a Bracha if he’s planning on eating a K’beitza. This is approximately 2 K’zeizim. Each K’zayis should be eaten within K’dei Achilas Pras (= 4 minutes) and without pausing between the two of them.
One must make a Birchas Hamazon if he ate a K’zayis of bread within 4 minutes. Other foods do not count for this amount.
If 4 minutes proves to be too difficult, one can be lenient and eat it within 6 minutes but should eat approximately the size of 1/3 of a K’beitza within 4 minutes. If one is not sure if it was eaten in the right amount of time – if he is satiated, he should still make a Birchas Hamazon.
Torah measurements are usually volume-based, not weight. A K’zayis is the approximate volume of half an average size egg. A K’beizah is the volume of an average size egg. Nonetheless, for simplicity, they have been converted to weight measurements, although the weight measurements are far from accurate. This is because different foods with an equal volume weigh differently. The following is the weight for water; bread and certainly matzah weighs less. For a K’beitza this is approx. 53.8 gram or 1.89 oz. For a K’zayis, approx. 25.6 gram or 0.90 oz.
One-third of a standard square machine matza is approximately a K’zayis. With bread, it is harder to measure, as they are not uniform but it is approximately the size of what would fit into a small l’chaim cup. In order to be safe, one should err on the side of caution and eat slightly more than the shiur, due to a number of reasons, among them since some crumbs remain between the teeth.

 Are Potato Chips/Pringles with an OU Fine?,"Potato chips – fried potato chips should be Bishul Yisroel. However steam cooked potato chips do not need to be exclusively bishul Yisroel.
Pringles – there is a Machlokes in regards to regular Potato chips if they need to be Bishul Yisroel and one should be stringent as mentioned, however, even according to the lenient opinion, there is room to be more stringent in regards to pringles.
Reasoning:
Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh Deah 113:1) requires Bishul Yisroel only on foods that are Oleh Al Shulchan Melachim (that would be served at the meals of royalty).
The Chachmas Adom 66:4 writes that foods like potato cuttings require to be Bishul Yisroel.
Although most opinions maintain that we define Oleh al Shulchan Melachim solely by the fact how it is served right now (if it is fit for a meal of royalty), since a fried potato would require to be bishul Yisroel, the potato chip should also be bishul Yisroel,
despite the fact that it is cut thin.
This would be analogous to a piece of meat: one cannot say that only certain cuts of meat that are fancy require Bishul Yisroel and non-fancy cuts of meat do not require Bishul Yisroel.
However If the potato chips are steam cooked, it does not require to be bishul Yisroel (see Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 113:13).
Pringles made from potato starch or potato flour – if the potato was cooked first it would have needed to be bishul Yisroel before it was turned into potato starch.
Therefore, Pringles are different than potato chips since during the process they were already cooked like regular potatoes even though they are dried afterward. Thus, it is problematic even for those who would argue that potato chips are fine, since the original Issur when it was cooked by a non-Jew remains. (Those who allow it use certain leniencies and some claim it’s better than potato chips.)

ואם כי ידים מוכיחות בכ״מ בפשי׳ דאזלינן בתר גמר ההכנה- מ״מ מצד חומר מאכ״א אף בדבר שעיקרו מד״ס, נהגו כו״כ מחסידים ואנשי מעשה להחמיר.
ולהעיר ממש״כ האריז״ל להחמיר גם בעולה על שלחן שרים.  ויתירה מזו שבענ״פ יחמיר גם באעעש״מ כלל. וע״ד מש״א בגמ׳ שאדם חשוב מחמיר גם בנאכל כמו״ש חי.
ובלא״ה, במק״א הארכנו שיתכן שלכו״ע יש לאסור בציפס כיון שמה שאינו עעש״מ הוא מרוב דקותו – כי גוף מאכל זה עעש״מ כשהוכן בצורה גדולה יותר.
ואלו דברינו שם: בפאטעטיא ציפס יש מחמירים. ולא רק מטעם שתפו״א עעש״מ ולהשיטה שהולכים אחרי מין המאכל ולא המאכל פרטי – שלרוה״פ לא קייל״ן הכי – כ״א שבאמת תפו״א מטוגנים עעש״מ ורק שכאן נחתך יותר דק. ולא מסתבר שגדר עעש״מ תלוי בגודל החתיכה, דא״כ כל חתיכה קטנה של בשר וכו׳ נימא הכי להתיר משום בשולי גוים כיון שמחמת קוטנו אעעש״מ. ושאני דגים קטנים שהסוג הוא קטן. אלא שי״א שבכלל תפו״א מטוגנים אעעש״מ. וכמדומה ה״ז היפך המציאות.
בקמח תפו״א – אם נתבשל לפנ״ז, הרבה מחמירים שאיסור שבו להיכן הלך.
בנוגע לעישון – אף שיש מחמירים שבעישון חם אסור, למעשה יש להקל.
גם – י״א שעעש״מ בתור חטיף לילדי המלכים. ואכ״מ].
והעיקר: בפרינגלס כיון שכבר נאסר כשנתבשלו בתור תפו״א, איסור שבו להיכן הלך.
ואף שיש מתירים ע״פ שו”ת אבקת רוכל סי’ ל: ילמדנו רבינו חטים ששולקים אותם הגויים עד שמגיעים למאכל בן דרוסאי וחוזרים ומייבשים אותם כדי לעשותן גריסין ושוב אינם נאכלים אלא ע”י בישול אחר מוקימנא להו למאכל בן דרוסאי או דילמא כיון שנתייבשו כולי האי חזרו להתירן הראשון?” והשיב הב”י “ובכה”ג נראה לומר בנ”ד דכיון דאיסורא דרבנן היא ויש מתירים הני חטים כיון דמתייבשין כ”כ דאינם נאכלים אלא ע”י בישול אחר והבשול הא’ אינו ניכר בהם מותרים ואפשר שאפילו האוסרים בתבשיל יתירו באלו החטים כיון שאינן נאכלין אלא ע”י בישול מחדש”. וכן גם בזה, שאחרי שנתבשל נתייבש –  יש לחלק בפשטות, כיון שאפשר להכשירם לאכילה אחרי היבוש גם במים קרים. ועוד זאת, שהוא רק ע״י עירוי ולא בישול ממש.
אבל יש מתירים כיון שנתבשל באידים וס״ל שהוא כמעושן. ואכ״מ.
[בכלל, בעירוי מלכתחילה אם דינו כבישול לגבי בישול נכרים: להעיר מירושלמי ע״ז ב, ח ובפני משה שם – חלוט שלהן – דמשמע שאינו כבישול.
וכמדומה במהרש״ם כתב להתיר ואינו תח״י כעת]."
 Does one need to ask a Rav before being induced? Is there any Halachic issue?,"
This matter is discussed in a number of Poskim. The general rule is that one may not induce or rush the onset of labor unless there are clear medical reasons to require it. Some of the reasons for this prohibition are because:
There is a level of risk inherent to childbirth, and one should therefore not hasten it even though it is bound to come.
The special assurance of protection Hashem provides at the time of childbirth does not necessarily apply to the same degree if the birth is hastened without a clear medical need.
The procedures and/or medicines involved in induction can themselves cause complications, and one should not take that risk needlessly.","###question

Thank you for contacting AskTheRav. We have received your question.
Please note that AskTheRav receives many questions from our visitors every day. We strive to answer these matters of practical Halacha in an efficient manner. Therefore, we ask our visitors to limit their questions to those of practical Halachic nature rather than learning style research questions, so that we can spend our time serving you best with your Halachic questions.
Regarding your question: The Chabad position re Zionism is very nuanced. An excellent summary can be found here, and here.
Regarding the usage of Ivrit, see here 
Regarding taking control of the mountain, Jews have complete control over that area. As for an obligation to build the Beis Hamikdosh on Temple Mount, this is actually one thing where the Rebbe was very clear on this matter. The same as virtually all gedolei Yisroel, the Rebbe was firmly opposed to any such talk and maintained that Geulah can only come about through Moshiach, and he is the one who is to instruct on building the Beis Hamikdosh.

The takana to learn chitas is on an individual basis, where everyone will finish the Chumash and Tanya throughout the year. And the Tehillim on a monthly basis.
Splitting up the chitas is not the ideal method, since you as an individual will not have completed the above. There is however some merit in it, since you, as part of a group, will have it completed (similar to the division of Shas has done on 19 Kislev, although as noted, this was not the original takana of chitas).
I suggest that in addition to splitting it among your friends, you also try to learn just the Chumash without Rashi, or to cover a certain amount throughout the day and complete the rest at a later point.The same can be with Tehilim (first kapital) and Tanya.","###question 
  Can a few women split the daily Chitas between themselves?
Is it ok and considered fulfilled to split chitas of the day with more than one person. I so badly want to fulfill the Rebbes Hora’ah especially with everything that’s going on in the world and to bring Moshiach. But chitas is too long for me to actually do while raising my kids etc. I had in mind to make a WhatsApp group to divide it between other women. Would that be considered fulfilling the chitas?.

In a place where the custom is to say hello to a women, it is commendable to say hello as well as reply to greetings, as this is not a greeting that contains any promiscuity, or affection, and on the contrary may result in a desecration of G-d’s name.

" Can a girl work in the younger division of a boys camp?
I work as an assistant director of a BOYS day camp.
We have campers age 6-12 and counselors aged 13-20.

Absolutely unacceptable. Even with married staff, there are concerns, certainly with teenagers. It is obvious that single boys and girls working together will undoubtedly lead to a sub-conscious laxity in tznius, and can extend even outside the workspace as they get more comfortable with each other, or in general, they can become comfortable with the opposite gender – a breach of the wall of tznius that exists in our society where boys/girls are kept separate. Often the staff will need to be in contact regarding different matters (transportation, trips, deliveries, etc.) that will require direct communication via cell phone, with its consequences.
I would rather not elaborate on such a topic, but many issues have arisen from such camps, with many having long-term effects. (I want to add that putting boys/girls in this situation with these challenges is a severe violation of Lifnei Iver, and very unfair to them, especially if they are/were unaware. Some counselors will be too embarrassed to speak up about it although the situation is difficult for them or they know it’s wrong).

And If we are dealing with a mossad of chinuch which endeavors to instill in the children proper chassidish values, the responsibility is greater.

Needless chatter (inevitable) – other than a polite hello when needed:

Referring by the first name:
I am a Seminary student and I work in an office in the afternoon. Can the males in the office call me by my first name or should they call me with the title Miss? I have to communicate information and be driven by a man.
Boys looking at girls (inevitable):
Are men allowed to look at women? (Not talking about family of course) and in what setting are men allowed to look at women? 
Proper dress – in a camp setting, people might come to be dressed in a way which is forbidden for someone of the opposite gender to see (this is a problem regardless but obviously doubled when an opposite gender is there).
Activities – some activities involve body movement which are forbidden to be viewed by boys/men – see here:
There is an exercise class with only female participants, however the instructor is male. Is it okay to join the class?

According to halacha, there are serious concerns with the husband being present in the delivery room. Even where a potential heter can be found, the Rebbe spoke strongly against this practice and stated that it is considered a breach of modesty. The Rebbe commented that at the time of birth one should seek out extra z’chusim and certainly not add in matters which are the opposite of z’chus.
That being said, if there is a concern of danger or if the woman is actually scared (and not just because she wants it or because others are doing it…)  and there is no one else to assist, you may help and do as she needs. You should preferably wear gloves to minimize contact and face the other direction.","###question

"I know we don’t cut on Thursday, but is Wednesday night included too? Because the day starts from the night before.

Nails shouldn’t be cut on Wednesday night – like Thursday.
Regarding nights in general –
May I cut my hair and nails after chatzos (midday)?
Sifrei Kabbalah (Holy writings of Kabbalah) relate that the Arizal would refrain from having his hair cut after midday. Some are of the opinion that the same would apply to cutting nails. The question is: what was the reason for this custom?
If it was because we shouldn’t engage in any new melachah (work) once the zman (time) of Mincha has arrived—lest we be distracted from davening Mincha—then we can assume that there is no issue with cutting our hair after having davened Mincha. Nails, however, may be cut even before davening Mincha.
However, if the reason was that according to Kabbalah the forces of dinim (Heavenly judgment) begin gaining strength after midday, it would be cause to refrain from doing so throughout the entire afternoon, and in fact more so at night, when the dinim are even more severe. Although the influence of the forces of dinim is mentioned specifically only regarding haircuts, it can arguably be applied to nail cutting too.
Common practice, though, is that we do take haircuts and cut our nails after midday—provided that we have davened Mincha—and at night as well. Likewise, If one has a fixed minyan for davening Mincha, one need not refrain from engaging in melacha prior to davening.","###question

 Do apricots or honey need a Hechsher?,"Honey:
Raw unflavored honey which is 100% pure and filtered may be used without a Hechsher. However, retail size honey often goes through heating which can be a problem when using shared equipment. It is therefore recommended to purchase honey only with a Hechsher. One must ensure that no other ingredients are added like alcohol and sweeteners. Additionally, the honey needs to be filtered very well from any pieces of the bees that can get mixed in it.
Apricots:
Fresh apricots do not require a Hechsher unless they are from Eretz Yisroel. Even dried apricots, if produced out of Eretz Yisroel (usually they are made in Turkey), do not require a Hechsher, provided they are unflavored, and without additives, since no other ingredients go in the drying process. Sulfur dioxide added is not a concern. However, some apricot companies season their apricots with flavoring to give their apricots a unique taste. Therefore, to be on the safer side it is best to buy only with a Hechsher as food processing is always changing. One must certainly ensure the apricots are insect free. They must be checked appropriately.","###question

 What is the Rebbe’s Minhag in how many Haddasim to use?,"It is the Chabad custom to add multiple Haddasim to the standard three, adding at least another three. The greater the number of additional Haddasim, the better.

The Rebbe’s personal custom is to take 36 since 5741. (In 5711 – 13; from 5712 till 5740 – 26).

A. I don’t see any reason to use or not to use the same amount the Rebbe does.
It should be noted that unlike other customs, in this specific matter, the Rebbeim give specific guidance to different individuals how much they should take. Also, the Rebbe himself changed the amount after the nesius. Same with the Rebbe Rayatz.

" Am I allowed to use the sunroof of a car with Schach on it as a Sukkah when out on a family trip on Chol Hamoed Sukkos?
SimilarQuestion:
Can one make a sukkah by removing T tops and placing a mat on top, into a kosher albeit, temporary sukkah? Both sides of the roof would be off, but there is a .5 foot separation running down the middle.","

In this case:
A. the Schach would have to be covering a (uninterrupted) space that is 32″ tall and 22.4″ by 22.4″ (the seats would be considered an interruption);
B. the car (which is being used as walls) cannot be more than 9.48″ off the ground and the sides have to be directly under the Schach, and have above height;
C. you would have to be comfortable to eat sleep and spend time there.
See also here:
Can we connect a U-Haul trailer to the back of a car and have a Sukkah there. Can we go into that on Shabbos or Yom Tov?
In conclusion, unless you meet all the above requirements, it cannot be done.
See also the following excerpts from our Day to Day Halachic Guide:
MOBILE SUKKAH
A person who is traveling without access to a Sukkah, can create a Sukkah out of a vehicle (or two), as follows:
LOCATION
The spot you choose should be semi-secluded, and not on a public path where it would interfere with foot traffic. It should also be a safe, crime-free area, where you would technically be able to sleep at night. It should also fulfill the other requirements for the positioning of a Sukkah – the area above the s’chach free of tree limbs or overhangs
ASSEMBLY
Use the front and back door of a single vehicle (on the same side) or open a single door on mirroring sides of two vehicles. (The interior of a convertible or roadster that fits all the dimensions below can be used as well.)
The area created by the three sides (either the two doors and the one car body, or the two car bodies and the adjacent doors) has to be at least seven tefachim long and seven tefachim wide (about 22.5 inches on each side).
The doors must reach ten tefachim (3.25 feet) in height and start no more than three tefachim (9.5 inches) off the ground. Parking near a curb and opening the door(s) over the curb will help in this regard.
The doors must be fully and firmly open, so that a gust of wind will not slam them closed.
ROOF
It is preferable not to prop the s’chach directly on the car doors, but to first place wood laths or the like across and the s’chach on top of that. The s’chach should be fixed to the “roof” with jute twine or string (not zip ties) so that it will not blow away.
The above is set up in such a way that the “walls” of the Sukkah are adjacently perpendicular to the s’chach. If there is an area of four amos (six feet) of car roof on any side of the Sukkah or four tefachim (13 inches) of car roof or other unkosher covering in the middle of the Sukkah, it is unusable.115 If the mobile Sukkah is of the smallest possible size (seven by seven tefachim), any three-tefach span of car roof – whether in the middle or on the side – will invalidate it.
USE
You must hold your food or put it down on a table or surface inside your makeshift Sukkah. You may not eat under the s’chach and use the seat in the car (outside your Sukkah) as your table.
You must stipulate that the vehicle(s) will be able to be used for (non-holy) purposes after the Sukkah is dismantled, since, as stated above, we are usually not allowed to use the parts of a Sukkah for another purpose once they were used for a mitzvah.","###question

"Is there an exception to that “rule”, like when auspicious days fall out on Shabbos? (i.e. are we supposed to go ahead and ask anyway?)","
According to Halacha one may not request their needs on Shabbos.
One of the reasons for this is because Shabbos accomplishes everything by itself without the need for us to resort to asking for it.  Even when Rosh Hashana or Yom Kippur – which are the most auspicious days of the year to request all of our needs – fall out on Shabbos we do not request our needs with Avinu Malkeinu.
You can make all your requests after Shabbos ends, especially regarding Yud Tes kislev which we celebrate the 20th of kislev as well.
Additionally, anything which is part of the standard text of davening is permitted. Thus, you may have your requests in mind in the Davening of Shabbos, especially during the sections of davening which we say on Shabbos for personal needs (which are permitted being that they are part of the Nussch which the Chachomim instituted) like Yehi Rotzon in the morning Berochos, the middle Beracha of Shabbos Shemone Esrei, Eloki Netzor at the end of Shemone Esrei, Brich Shmei when the Aron Hakodesh is opened and Yekum Purkan and Mi Shebeirach before Musaf. It is important that we have extra kavana when reciting these tefillos. This is more preferred over any personal prayers.
As well, requests for a Refuah Shleima of critically sick person or spiritual requests are permitted on Shabbos. However we do not confess our sins on Shabbos.
We must use out these auspicious days especially when they fall out on Shabbos for extra Davening, learning, Farbrengen and undertaking good resolutions.","###question

 האם צריך למחות במי שלומד בליל הניטל? ומה אם זה ילד?,"אף שמנהג זה יסודתו בהררי קודש ונתפשט בתפוצות ישראל, ולא רק אצל חסידים, ונהגו בו מדורי דורות, כידוע ומפורסם, ומילא מובן גם שיש לחנך הילדים לקיים המנהג – מעולם לא שמענו שצריך למחות בכגון דא. וישתמש בכח וכושר המחאה לדברים אחרים. ובפרט במי שאצלו לא נהגו במנהג זה (שהרי ידוע שבכמה קהילות לא נתפשט המנהג. וראה אג״ק חי״ג ע׳ קיט).

ואף שכמובן אין ראי׳ לדבר, זכר לדבר.

  האם צריך למחות במי שלומד בליל הניטל? ומה אם זה ילד?.

 אף שמנהג זה יסודתו בהררי קודש ונתפשט בתפוצות ישראל, ולא רק אצל חסידים, ונהגו בו מדורי דורות, כידוע ומפורסם, ומילא מובן גם שיש לחנך הילדים לקיים המנהג – מעולם לא שמענו שצריך למחות בכגון דא. וישתמש בכח וכושר המחאה לדברים אחרים. ובפרט במי שאצלו לא נהגו במנהג זה (שהרי ידוע שבכמה קהילות לא נתפשט המנהג. וראה אג״ק חי״ג ע׳ קיט).

"Q1. For heartburn/acid reflux, may one chew Tums with letters on Shabbos? If not, what should one do?","A. Swallowing pills with letters isn’t a problem. The issue is eating where it breaks before swallowing.
However, tums are a problem due to taking medication on Shabbos. It is permissible if either of the following conditions exists:
If one takes it before the onset of heartburn. Likewise, if taken for its nutritional value, as a calcium supplement, rather than to cure existing heartburn, there is room to be lenient.
If one is bedridden or his pain causes a sickness/ weakness in the entire body (such as severe pain where one cannot function).
If one has no choice as all foods cause heartburn.
If mixed into food before Shabbos.
Q2: What if the pain prevents sleep, or is really disturbing in general, may one take tums then?
A. Tzaar Gadol, strong pain, isn’t a license to take medications unless it causes one to be bedridden or general weakness in the entire body.
In such situations, it is recommended to mix the medication into food before Shabbos, as mentioned.

Am I allowed to open and close the radiator knob in my apartment?","
On Shabbos, it is forbidden to turn on the taps of the radiator as this causes the cold water in the radiator to flow into the boiler, where it would be heated.
You cannot turn on the taps even if the heating system is not yet operating but will be turned on during Shabbos.
It is permissible to turn off the taps of the radiator on Shabbos, however it is proper to refrain from doing so as long as the water inside the radiator is in the process of being heated and has not yet reached a temperature of 113 degrees Fahrenheit (45 degrees Celsius).
This is because turning off the taps causes the water in the boiler to reach a temperature of 113 degrees Fahrenheit more quickly than it otherwise would.

I do not control the heat. The heat is turned off and on in the whole building and since the thermostat is not on my apartment, it doesn’t go on and off depending on the temperature by me.
I can only open or close the radiator in my apartment which will allow the heat, which is already on and heating apartments below & on top of me, to flow (or to not flow) into the radiator that is in my apartment.
Am I allowed to open and close the radiator knob in my apartment?.
 ###answer 
 
On Shabbos, it is forbidden to turn on the taps of the radiator as this causes the cold water in the radiator to flow into the boiler, where it would be heated.
You cannot turn on the taps even if the heating system is not yet operating but will be turned on during Shabbos.
It is permissible to turn off the taps of the radiator on Shabbos, however it is proper to refrain from doing so as long as the water inside the radiator is in the process of being heated and has not yet reached a temperature of 113 degrees Fahrenheit (45 degrees Celsius).
This is because turning off the taps causes the water in the boiler to reach a temperature of 113 degrees Fahrenheit more quickly than it otherwise would.
On Yom Tov there is a different Halacha.

The definition of Keli B’toch Keli is that at least one Keli isn’t designed specifically for this holy item.
There is a disagreement how to interpret the concept of “not being designated”. In fact, some authorities allow preparing in advance two coverings with the intention of it being considered Keli B’toch Keli, even though both coverings were made for the holy item.

Otherwise, it’s not a sufficient covering. However, the plain reading of the Halacha is that a cover which was designated in advance is never acceptable.

 What are the Halachos of Yichud when using Uber? ,"Uber:
Almost all of the Halachos of driving a regular car apply to a taxi or Uber, i.e. one may travel when it is lit up and during the time when there are people in the street (on those streets), and the windows are not tinted in a way that someone can’t see into the car.(ראה שערים מצויינים בהלכה סי’ קנב ס”ק ג)
However, there are those that are Machmir and hold that wherever possible, one should not travel with a non-Jew or a ‘Parutz’ even by day  (ראה מנחת איש פרק יז ה’ ד). With an Uber there is more room for leniency, as there are governing laws of the company for drivers, with GPS monitoring.
Parutz:
There is a Machlokes in Poskim how to define a Parutz. One must be especially careful in this regard when exposed to Yichud on a regular basis, such as in a workplace.
It is clear that a person who is not particular with the Issur of Kriva L’arayos and does not keep the guidelines of Tznius, even if he otherwise a Shomer Torah U’mitzvos, is  certainly considered  a Parutz. For example, a man who has no inhibitions about embracing women or girls, one who regularly watches television, reads unsuitable material, frequents indecent chat rooms on the internet, or visits movie theaters is considered a Parutz. The mere exposure to immodesty affects their morality. See Toras HaYichud 3:2:4. Shevet Halevi Vol. 5:202:1.
A man whose business dealings are questionable might be considered a Parutz in relation to Yichud — see Nitei Gavriel Yichud 22:9.
Furthermore, the average non-observant Jew is to be considered a Parutz too. The Tzemach Tzedek E”H 39 rules, that the definition of Anashim Ksheirim is one who has a special Chezkas Kashrus, such as a Talmid Chacham, and the standard Chezkas Kashrus of all Klal Yisroel isn’t sufficient. It seems that it need not be Mamosh a Talmid Chacham; it could be a Yeshiva Bachur etc., but it is not enough that we are not aware of any Pritzus behavior. See also Nitei Gavriel Yichud 19:3,10.

If I understand correctly from chapter 4 of “The Laws of Cooking on Shabbos” (by Rabbi Nissan Dovid Dubov, SIE) it can be placed on the blech on Shabbos. [“b) A dry kugel that may emit a small amount of oil may be reheated.”]","

True, there is no issue of nolad in the case of a kugel that emits a small amount of oil. However, there certainly is an issue of bishul. The only way one may reheat a kugel on Shabbos is if it’s absolutely dry to the touch, something highly unusual with ordinary fried kugel.

 Is there an Inyan in saying Hallel with the Minyan?,"Yes.
One should make an extra effort to be holding with the Minyan for Hallel. The Rebbe once told someone who was accustomed to daven be’arichus that he should begin prior to the Minayn so that when they reach Hallel he should be holding with them. Similarly, the Rebbe writes in Igros Kodesh: ”Despite the fact that our Rebbeim would extend their Shabbos prayers over many hours – long after the congregation had concluded the service – they would nevertheless organize their time on Yom Tov so that they would conclude the amidah with the congregation and then recite Hallel together with them”.
This applies not only to Rosh Chodesh (and other times we recite chatzi Hallel), when there is a safek in regards to the proper way the Bracha on Hallel should be recited, but also to Chanukah and other Yomim Tovim -when regardles a Bracha on Hallel is said because the complete Hallel is recited- for there are other reasons that Hallel should be recited with the Minayn (namely, to answer הודו and אנא with the Minyan; it is more honorable to praise Hashemin public; to publicise the miracles we are praising Hashem for).","###question

"1) Do I need to make a new Brocha if I change my Tzitzis midday (after exercise, for example)?","2a) If I merely try-on a pair of Tzitizis, or otherwise plan to soon take them off—is a Brocha still required?
2b) What if I try them on over another pair of Tzitzis? Do I need to make a Brocha for both pairs?
Answers:
1) Yes. 
A new Mitzvah is performed every time one wears a four-cornered garment with Tzitzis. Therefore, a Bracha should be made each time one puts on Tzitzis.
2-a) Yes. 
As long as one benefits from wearing a garment, Tzitzis is required and a Brocha should therefore be made (benefit can include simply not being without Tzitzis even for a moment). (According to Poskim, wearing the Tzitzis for the time it takes to walk four cubits (3 seconds) qualifies as “deriving benefit”.)
2-b) No. 
As mentioned, each four-cornered garment you wear is an additional Mitzvah and therefore requires a new Bracha (no matter how many pairs you are wearing). In this case, however, you are merely trying-on the Tzitzis for size and no benefit is had. And unlike above, the benefit of avoiding being temporarily without the Mitzva is also absent (since you have not taken off your own Tzitzis).","###question

How to use a toilet which flushes by a sensor?,"Where no other bathroom is available, you may use an auto-flush toilet by activating the sensor in an irregular manner, for example walking away on your heels or sides of the feet in an uncomfortable manner. Ideally, you should first place a tissue or paper towel over the sensor, in a manner that it will eventually fall off later by itself, so that the toilet won’t flush immediately when you leave the toilet.
How to use water from a faucet which is operated only by sensor?
You should use a bottle of water or another cleanser.
Where this is not possible: After using the bathroom, you may satisfy with rubbing your hands with a cloth or other material, unless you’re planning on davening thereafter, in which case you may ask a non-Jew to fill up a cup of water for you. If however, you want to wash your hands before davening but you did not use the bathroom or touch parts of the body that are usually covered, you should just rub your hands. For washing before bread or upon awakening in the morning, you may also ask a non-Jew to fill up water for you.

Our son was born on 19 Iyar. This year Erev Shavuos is on Shabbos. When should we make the Upshernish – on Friday 4 of Sivan or Tuesday Isru Chag?,"
• Generally:
For a child whose birthday is from after Lag Baomer until Erev Shavuos, the Upshernish haircut should take place on Erev Shavuos. [When Erev Shavuos falls on Shabbos – on 4 Sivan (with the exception of someone whose birthday is on Erev Shavuos, in which case it should be postponed until after Shavuos)].

• However, regarding someone whose birthday is on 19 Iyar, a day after Lag Baomer:
There are instructions from the Rebbe to perform the haircut on Lag Baomer.
While in most places it appears that it should take place on Lag Baomer itself (during the day), a day before the child turns 3, others record that it should be done on the actual birthday, right after nightfall on the night after Lag Baomer.
See here the testimony of three people who were all instructed by the Rebbe to do it on Lag Baomer: R. SB Popak, R. YY Hecht and R. Refoel Hartman. In the case of R. Hecht, the Rebbe himself did the cutting. (This information has been independently verified by us). In the case of R. Hartman, we have the actual answer of the Rebbe.
Independent of the above, there is yet another directive presented regarding the Upshernish of Ari Halberstam hy”d (whose birthday is on 19 Iyar), of which there are pictures of the Rebbe cutting the hair. See in the Hebrew references below.

One should not change from what is commonly practiced in the place where they live. Poskim tell us while dikduk is very important, one should ensure that they do not overemphasize the dikduk in such a way that it sounds very strange to the listeners.

 How many women must be in a house in the evening if a man is there and his wife is in the city but out of the house for the evening?,"A man may not be with even two women as this is yichud.
According to many poskim, this applies even to more than two women. This is the accepted practice.
However, some poskim maintain that more than two women is permissible. When desperate, and no other choices are available there might be room to rely on this position.
Even according to the lenient position, by night or when traveling, some say that even many women is forbidden. Others say it would need to be four women. This is the accepted position, in desperate situations, as mentioned.

  How many women must be in a house in the evening if a man is there and his wife is in the city but out of the house for the evening?.
 ###answer 
 A man may not be with even two women as this is yichud.
According to many poskim, this applies even to more than two women. This is the accepted practice.
However, some poskim maintain that more than two women is permissible. When desperate, and no other choices are available there might be room to rely on this position.
Even according to the lenient position, by night or when traveling, some say that even many women is forbidden. Others say it would need to be four women. This is the accepted position, in desperate situations, as mentioned.
If one has a job which the nature of the job brings him in contact with women, all agree that yichud is forbidden even with three or more women.
A wife protects from yichud only if she in the house.

 Which Bracha does one make on a meat barley soup?,"1. Even if there is no meat in a soup but it was cooked with meat, the taste of the meat overrides the taste of the vegetables and the Bracha is Shehakol.
2. If the soup was cooked with grain which is Mezonos, with the intention of eating the grain, the soup becomes Mezonos even when one drinks the soup on its own. This applies even if it was cooked with meat. If there is now visible meat in the soup, it is questionable whether the visible meat requires its own Bracha.
If the soup was cooked just for the liquid, the soup is Shehakol. If one is now eating the grain with the soup, one should first make Shehakol on the soup and then Mezonos on the grain.
3. If the soup is cooked with grain which is Ha’adama, the Bracha in the soup is Shehakol, regardless. If eating the grain with it, one should first say Shehakol on the soup and then Ha’adama on the grain.
4. Barley soup is questionable whether the grain is considered Mezonos or Ha’adama. If the barley kernel was split into pieces it’s Mezonos. If it’s a whole kernel, as in pearl barley, it’s Mezonos, if it’s shelled. Others say the kernels must become soft and stick to each other due to a lot of cooking, in order to become Mezonos. Otherwise, it’s Ha’adama.

There have been package thefts in my building. On Shabbos may I kick a package through the doorway and into the apartment? There is an Eiruv Chatzeros in the building. Is the din the same on Yom Tov?","
For your situation (where an Eiruv Chatzeiros was done):
If the delivery man leaves the package in a place where it is permissible to carry on Shabbos to and from your apartment, you can bring the package into your apartment using a Shinuy – same applies to Yom Tov.
However, it is important to mention that this is only if a proper Eiruv Chatzeiros was done (which causes the entire area covered by the Eiruv to be considered within Daled Amos of the original location).
However, in a situation where there is no Eiruv Chatzeiros, you would not be allowed to move it outside of Daled Amos of the location the delivery man placed it. This applies even on Yom Tov (when carrying can be permitted in a regular circumstance), since it came from outside the Techum, it is bound by the Halachos of Techum which apply equally on Shabbos and Yom Tov.","###question

" Who Should Lead the Zimun?
Is there a Minhag for the Baal Habais to lead the Zimmun?
Is there a difference between Shabbos night and Shabbos day meal?
What if there is a kohen present?","
There is such a custom that on Friday night the host leads the zimmun. Otherwise, he may honor the guest. This custom applies even when a kohen is present.
Explanation:
Although there is a mitzvah to honor the guests, this only applied in the past when only one individual bentched and he exempted the others. Nowadays, when everyone bentches themselves there is no such mitzvah. Even in those days, if the host wished to lead the bentching himself and not honor the host, at any time, he may do so.
A kohen takes precedence only if he is equal in Torah standing to the others. Otherwise, the Talmid Chochom precedes him. Additionally, all this applies where all attendees are hosts or all are guests (and the host isn’t joining).","###question

The problem is that we need to move there already this time next year since we are not able to afford to pay rent and mortgage at the same time and we cant start building until September. Any way around this?,"
All of this applies only if there was no building whatsoever in the entire area, even a small building.
If there was indeed no building, including a structure for the construction crew, the rule is as follows:
Regarding the area of the Shul, it is not an issue.
For the residential areas, if it’s for a home for a teacher or any other communal worker, it is not an issue. There’s also room for leniency if being bought by a young couple right after marriage.
If they’re being rented out and the owner is not the one living there, it’s not an issue either.
If the owner himself is living on the property, he should build a sukkah there first and afterwards it’s not a problem. Also, a proper Chanukas Habayis should be done to consecrate the home for Torah and Davening.
Another option is to make an independent “sale” of the home to someone else for the first year, and then one may live there immediately thereafter. (Alternatively, if you already own it prior to it being finished, you can sell it right then and there, and only when it’s complete will you re-purchase it).
Regardless, you should receive approval of three Rabbonim to go ahead with either of these leniencies.

 מחר הבר מצוה של אחי הצעיר והוא בע”ה יעלה לתורה ב-770. אבא שלי לא יכל להגיע. בנוגע לברכת ברוך שפטרני – האם אפשרי לברך באמצעות הטלפון?,"האב אינו צריך להיות נוכח בשעת העלי׳. ויברך ממקומו.
אבל, עליו לומר בשינוי קצת ״מעונשו של בני״, או ״בני פלוני״.
וכדאי שיהיו עשרה במקומו. אבל אינו מעכב.
ואם רוצה יוכל לאומרה עוד הפעם ללא שם ומלכות – שבכל מקרה כך מנהגנו תמיד – בנוכחות בנו.
מקורות:
בשו״ת יד יצחק ג, שג, מדייק מנוסח הברכה, שיש לברך רק בפני הבן. וסברתו שם, שעל האב לעורר את הבן, לילך בדרך טובים, כי אחריותו נסתלקה מעליו. והו״ד בשערי רחמים על שע״א ד, כה. (וראה כעי״ז בתוכן הברכה בחתן סופר עשו״ע או״ח, א, סוף שער ברכת השחר בשוה״ג ד״ה אבל. ובאמת, כבר כתב כן בשע״א שם, שאפשר שצ״ל עומד שם בשעת הברכה כדי לחנכו לברך [כנראה – היינו ברכה״ת] כהוגן. ולהעיר גם מפי׳ ופסקים לרבינו אביגדור כ, שיעמוד אצל בנו וישים ידו על ראשו כשמברך. וכ״ה במנהגי וורמישא (שמש, וקירכום). ובבא״ח ש״א ראה יז, שיתפוס בנו בידו בשעת הברכה. ולהעיר משו״ת תשוה״נ א סוסי׳ קנו).
אבל בשו״ת שאילת שלמה ב, עה, נוטה לומר שגם כשאינו עומד עם בנו מברך. ונוסח הברכה ״מעונש הלזה״ אינו מוכיח שהיותו נוכח הוא לעיכובא, אלא לפי שכ״ה בסתמא (וילה״ע, שבאמת נתחבטו כמה בטעם הנוסח שאינו אומר ״של בני״ – ראה שו״ת אפרקסתא דעניא ח״ד קונטרס ברמ״צ ע׳ רסב. ועוד. ובכמה ספרי דרוש – ראה דודאים של משה ע׳ קה ואילך. ראש אליהו ברמ״צ דרוש י. ועוד). וכ״כ למעשה בשו״ת נהרי אפרסמון ב, מח. וראה בארוכה בשו״ת בצה״ח ה, קלב (ועוד שם – קלג). ושם, שסתימת הפוסקים שלא הזכירו מזה מוכח שאצ״ל שם. ועיי״ש שהעיר משו״ת ר׳ ידידי׳ טיאה וייל טז, שלא שמע מאביו בעל קרבן נתנאל מתי בירך עליו ברכה זו. (ופשוט, שמש״כ רבינו אביגדור לשים ידו על ראשו – מיירי באופן הרגיל, שנמצא שם, ואין הכרח שכצ״ל בדוקא. ובלא״ה, הרי לא נהגו כן).
ואף לדברי היד יצחק, ראה בשו״ת בצה״ח שם שי״ל דקאי רק בדאפשר, ולא כשנמצא בעיר אחרת ואא״פ באו״א. ובנדוננו, שמתקשר בטלפון, הרי ביכולתו לעוררו גם ע״י הטלפון. וכש״כ בראי׳ ע״י מסך. וראה דרך האתרים א, ע׳ רסז ובהנסמן שם. ובכגון דא, מסתבר שה״ז גם בכלל נודע לרבים שהוא ברמ״צ, כיון שנשמע ע״י הטלפון. והעיקר, דסגי לן שנודע לרבים במקום המצאו של הבן. [ובאופן זה, כשהוא ע״י הטלפון, גם אין מקום להשקו״ט אם יש לבנו חזקת חיים (אם כי פשוט שבכל אופן יש לו חזקת חיים. וראה גם נהרי אפרסמון שם)].
וא״ש מה שבלקט יושר ע׳ 41 כתב שלא בירך מלכתחילה כשנעשה בנו ברמ״צ, כיון שלא הי׳ שם, ושאל אצל רבו התרוה״ד אם לברך אח״כ – דהתם י״ל שלא נודע לו אם בנו קרא בתורה וכדומה. ובלא״ה, קשה לדייק מדברי השואל בעל לקט יושר, דגופא דעובדא הכי הוה, ועל דברי השואל, לאו מר בר רב אשי, בעל תרוה״ד, חתים עלה, ורק מתשובתו יש מקום לדייק.
ומסתבר שבכגון דא מברך ״מעונשו של בני״ (או ״בני פלוני״) – ראה שאילת שלמה ונהרי אפרסמון שם. וכ״כ בעל פרי השדה בשו״ת שנדפס בקובץ לקט שושנה א, לד. מבשר צדק (ברמ״צ) קאצבורג אות לה (ע׳ מה). וכ״ה בשו״ת רבבות אפרים ז, נט.

ואין לחוש לשנוי נוסח הברכה בכגון דא (שחש לזה בשו״ת בצה״ח שם), בשינוי קטן ע״פ המתחייב, וכפי שמצינו בכ״מ כיו״ב (כמו על מצות ציצית, על הדלקת נר של שבת, וכיו״ב. ודעת לנבון נקל לחלק בין זה למש״כ המג״א רסי׳ ריט בשם מהר״ם מינץ, ע״ד השמטת תיבת ״לחייבים״ שהוא מעיקר טופס הברכה. וראה גם לקו״ש חל״ג ע׳ 128 ואילך. ולהעיר גם מהשינויים ומחלוקת בנוסח ברכת המצות, ולדוגמא: על הטבילה, טבילת כלי, כלים, כלי מתכות, כלי סעודה, להפריש חלה, חלה תרומה, חלה מן העיסה, כיסוי דם, הדם, דם בעפר, וכיו״ב). ומה גם שנוסח ״מעונש בני״ נמצא במדרש שכל טוב תולדות כה, כז. ועוד. ולהעיר, שבספר האסופות דיני או״ה סי׳ קעו בסופו: מעונש של בני זה. [ולהעיר מהשקו״ט עד״ז בבנים תאומים, אם לברך מעונשם של אלו, של זה ושל זה, או ב׳ ברכות בפ״ע].
ולכל היותר יוכל לאומרה עוה״פ, בנוכחות בנו, בנוסח הרגיל, שבלא״ה מנהגנו שמברכים ללא שו״מ (ראה גם בשו״ת רי״ט וייל, שמציע בכלל לומר ב״פ, עיי״ש טעמו) – ראה עד״ז בשו״ת לבעל פרי השדה הנ״ל. בצה״ח שם.
וראה קצוה״ש סה בבדה״ש יד, שיכול לברך כ״ז שירצה כמו ברכת הגומל. ולכאו׳ סברא היא, שכ״ה בכל ברכת הודאה כשהטובה עדיין קיימת. וצ״ע מש״כ בשו״ת משנ״ה יא, קפד שמברך דוקא מיד כבברכת המצות. והרי ממתינים עד שעולה לתורה, ובכ״מ שעולה רק בשבת, אף שאינו ביום כניסתו למצות. ושם ר״ל שמה״ט נהוג היום שמברכים ללא שו״מ. וד״ז זר עד למאד. וראה שו״ת רבבות אפרים ז, שם, משה״ק עליו. (ולהעיר שבלקו״ד ב ע׳ 528, משמע שאדה״ז אמר ברכת שפטרני בשו״מ שלא ביום עלייתו לתורה של בנו אדמו״ר האמצעי. ושם: ברכת הפטורה. וכבר העירו שלכאורה היא טה״ד).
ואמנם, יתכן שלכתחילה נכון שלא לאחר ג׳ ימים כבברכת הגומל. וכ״כ בשו״ת צי״א ז, כג, ד. (אבל יש לחלק, שבב״י ריט, כתב בשם האר״ח בשם רמב״ן, בטעמא דמילתא שרק עד ג״י נק׳ בא מן הדרך. ואינו שייך לעניננו. ועצ״ע בנוגע לחבוש וחולה. והעיר מזה בתורת חיים סופר יז. ואולי שתוך ג״י הוא לבוד, ועיקר הברכה מיד כשיצא מהסכנה – ראה תו״ח שם טז. ובריש הסי׳ ד״ה ולענ״ד). וצ״ע מלקט יושר שם, שאם לא בירך לפנ״ז כבר א״צ לברך, אף שהוא עצמו נהג להמתין אצל בנו עד שקרא בתורה. ואולי ס״ל שלאחר זמן רב ל״ש לברך. ובפרט שאין השמחה קיימת כבר (משא״כ בברכת הגומל, שההודאה היא על הצלתו). ובכלל, יתכן דס״ל גם בברכת הגומל שאין תשלומין אחר ג׳ או ה׳ ימים, כדעת כמה ראשונים.
אבל מש״כ בשו״ת בצה״ח שם, שאין לברך אחרי ל״י, ונסתייע מברכת הגומל – לא ה״ר לדבריו, שלא אמרו אלא להמתין עד ל״י עבור עשרה (משנ״ב ריט, ח ע״פ הרא״ה ברכות נד, ב. ועוד), ולא שאינו מברך אח״כ, דהא אינהו ס״ל שהגומל מברך גם ביחיד (ולדידן מספקא לן הלכתא כמאן – ראה רמ״א ג. וצ״ע שהמשנ״ב העתיק דברי הרא״ה למעשה, אף שיש כאן ספק ברכה. וגם למש״כ בבה״ל שם ד״ה וי״א בשם רעק״א, דאינו אסור לברך בלא עשרה דלא גרע מאדם דעלמא שמברך על חבירו – עדיין נכנס לספק ברכה לאחמ״כ כשיזדמנו לו עשרה). וכמ״ש הו״ע (בשו״ת בצה״ח ה, פח), שגם אחרי י׳ שנה מברך הגומל. (ודלא כערוה״ש ז, שבהפליג ונשכח הענין כבר אינו מברך. וסתימת הפוסקים שלא חילקו בדבר – מורה דלא כוותייהו). ומש״כ שם עפ״ז, במי שנוהג לברך בשו״מ, להמתין עד ל״י שיוכל לברך בפני בנו – צ״ע, דלא דמי כעוכלא לדנא, שברכת הגומל בעשרה הוא מדינא דגמרא, משא״כ לברך ברכת שפטרני בפני בנו.
בעשרה – ראה שו״ת דברי מלכיאל א, ד שמחדש שצריך עשרה. וכן נקט בשו״ת צי״א שם. וראה גם תשוה״נ ב, קמב בסופו. שמחת יהודה ע׳ עח. משנת יוסף יא, מח, ו. הליכות ביתה יא הערה נח בסופה. אלא, שבלא״ה נהגו לברך רק כשנודע לרבים – דהיינו עשרה, ראה מרפא לנפש זילבער ב, סד – שנעשה ברמ״צ, ובד״כ מברך בעלייתו לתורה, שיש שם עשרה.
אבל ראה שו״ת בצה״ח שם קלד שהאריך להוכיח שא״צ עשרה. ומוכיח לה מכ״מ. וכ״כ בזה השולחן סרכ״ה. וראה שמחת יהודה ע׳ ע. ולהעיר, שסתימת הרמ״א רכה, ב (וכ״ה בכ״מ) שלא הזכיר שצ״ל בעת קריה״ת, ובכ״מ כתבו רק כשהגיע לכלל מצות (ולהעיר מהשינויים בין סידור אדה״ז לשאר סידורי חב״ד) – משמע שא״צ עשרה.","###question 
  מחר הבר מצוה של אחי הצעיר והוא בע”ה יעלה לתורה ב-770. אבא שלי לא יכל להגיע. בנוגע לברכת ברוך שפטרני – האם אפשרי לברך באמצעות הטלפון?.
 ###answer 
 האב אינו צריך להיות נוכח בשעת העלי׳. ויברך ממקומו.
אבל, עליו לומר בשינוי קצת ״מעונשו של בני״, או ״בני פלוני״.
וכדאי שיהיו עשרה במקומו. אבל אינו מעכב.
ואם רוצה יוכל לאומרה עוד הפעם ללא שם ומלכות – שבכל מקרה כך מנהגנו תמיד – בנוכחות בנו.
מקורות:
בשו״ת יד יצחק ג, שג, מדייק מנוסח הברכה, שיש לברך רק בפני הבן. וסברתו שם, שעל האב לעורר את הבן, לילך בדרך טובים, כי אחריותו נסתלקה מעליו. והו״ד בשערי רחמים על שע״א ד, כה. (וראה כעי״ז בתוכן הברכה בחתן סופר עשו״ע או״ח, א, סוף שער ברכת השחר בשוה״ג ד״ה אבל. ובאמת, כבר כתב כן בשע״א שם, שאפשר שצ״ל עומד שם בשעת הברכה כדי לחנכו לברך [כנראה – היינו ברכה״ת] כהוגן. ולהעיר גם מפי׳ ופסקים לרבינו אביגדור כ, שיעמוד אצל בנו וישים ידו על ראשו כשמברך. וכ״ה במנהגי וורמישא (שמש, וקירכום). ובבא״ח ש״א ראה יז, שיתפוס בנו בידו בשעת הברכה. ולהעיר משו״ת תשוה״נ א סוסי׳ קנו).
אבל בשו״ת שאילת שלמה ב, עה, נוטה לומר שגם כשאינו עומד עם בנו מברך. ונוסח הברכה ״מעונש הלזה״ אינו מוכיח שהיותו נוכח הוא לעיכובא, אלא לפי שכ״ה בסתמא (וילה״ע, שבאמת נתחבטו כמה בטעם הנוסח שאינו אומר ״של בני״ – ראה שו״ת אפרקסתא דעניא ח״ד קונטרס ברמ״צ ע׳ רסב. ועוד. ובכמה ספרי דרוש – ראה דודאים של משה ע׳ קה ואילך. ראש אליהו ברמ״צ דרוש י. ועוד). וכ״כ למעשה בשו״ת נהרי אפרסמון ב, מח. וראה בארוכה בשו״ת בצה״ח ה, קלב (ועוד שם – קלג). ושם, שסתימת הפוסקים שלא הזכירו מזה מוכח שאצ״ל שם. ועיי״ש שהעיר משו״ת ר׳ ידידי׳ טיאה וייל טז, שלא שמע מאביו בעל קרבן נתנאל מתי בירך עליו ברכה זו. (ופשוט, שמש״כ רבינו אביגדור לשים ידו על ראשו – מיירי באופן הרגיל, שנמצא שם, ואין הכרח שכצ״ל בדוקא. ובלא״ה, הרי לא נהגו כן).
ואף לדברי היד יצחק, ראה בשו״ת בצה״ח שם שי״ל דקאי רק בדאפשר, ולא כשנמצא בעיר אחרת ואא״פ באו״א. ובנדוננו, שמתקשר בטלפון, הרי ביכולתו לעוררו גם ע״י הטלפון. וכש״כ בראי׳ ע״י מסך. וראה דרך האתרים א, ע׳ רסז ובהנסמן שם. ובכגון דא, מסתבר שה״ז גם בכלל נודע לרבים שהוא ברמ״צ, כיון שנשמע ע״י הטלפון. והעיקר, דסגי לן שנודע לרבים במקום המצאו של הבן. [ובאופן זה, כשהוא ע״י הטלפון, גם אין מקום להשקו״ט אם יש לבנו חזקת חיים (אם כי פשוט שבכל אופן יש לו חזקת חיים. וראה גם נהרי אפרסמון שם)].
וא״ש מה שבלקט יושר ע׳ 41 כתב שלא בירך מלכתחילה כשנעשה בנו ברמ״צ, כיון שלא הי׳ שם, ושאל אצל רבו התרוה״ד אם לברך אח״כ – דהתם י״ל שלא נודע לו אם בנו קרא בתורה וכדומה. ובלא״ה, קשה לדייק מדברי השואל בעל לקט יושר, דגופא דעובדא הכי הוה, ועל דברי השואל, לאו מר בר רב אשי, בעל תרוה״ד, חתים עלה, ורק מתשובתו יש מקום לדייק.
ומסתבר שבכגון דא מברך ״מעונשו של בני״ (או ״בני פלוני״) – ראה שאילת שלמה ונהרי אפרסמון שם. וכ״כ בעל פרי השדה בשו״ת שנדפס בקובץ לקט שושנה א, לד. מבשר צדק (ברמ״צ) קאצבורג אות לה (ע׳ מה). וכ״ה בשו״ת רבבות אפרים ז, נט.

This applies according to Halacha the night after Tisha B’av. Some follow this custom on the night preceding and following every fast. This concept can apply even to to those who do not fast, if their health permits.
However, the Alter Rebbe implies that this applies only in relation to the night after the fast. Since the Alter Rebbe mentions it only regarding fasts which one takes upon themselves for atonement, it is likely he does not agree with keeping this stringency regarding other regular fasts.

Depending on the details, it would likely be permitted based on the rule of nullification in sixty times of the non-kosher.
Kavush wouldn’t  be a problem as the kosher Slurpee’s would only absorb the taste of the Keli after 24 hours, in which case it would be Pagum.
שו״ע אדה״ז תמז, כח.
This question should be addressed to the certifying Hechsher, if there is one, or the agencies which produce lists of kosher Slurpee’s.
Of course, it’s always best to use Slurpee’s from a kosher certified location
From what I’ve read, but haven’t verified it myself:
99.9% of Slurpee flavors are kosher pareve. The Slurpee machine operates at 28°F, too cold for there to be any blios flavor. There are also no issues of kavush because of the high turnover of product. The flavors don’t usually sit in the machines for 24 hours. The compartment in the machine is so small that the Slurpee flavor is replaced after filling a few cups.
However, Slurpee is a registered trademark sold only at 7-Eleven stores. Other gas stations or convenience stores sell similar products but more caution is needed when purchasing from them. While 7-Eleven stores mostly use the main brands which are more likely to be kosher certified, other stores may use generic-brands that are not necessarily kosher certified. If the dispenser is shared among more than one flavor, and you cannot confirm that they are all kosher, it is recommended to run the machine until there is no residue of the previous flavor before filling your cup.

This question should be addressed to the certifying Hechsher, if there is one, or the agencies which produce lists of kosher Slurpee’s.
Of course, it’s always best to use Slurpee’s from a kosher certified location
From what I’ve read, but haven’t verified it myself:
99.9% of Slurpee flavors are kosher pareve. The Slurpee machine operates at 28°F, too cold for there to be any blios flavor. There are also no issues of kavush because of the high turnover of product. The flavors don’t usually sit in the machines for 24 hours. The compartment in the machine is so small that the Slurpee flavor is replaced after filling a few cups.
However, Slurpee is a registered trademark sold only at 7-Eleven stores. Other gas stations or convenience stores sell similar products but more caution is needed when purchasing from them. While 7-Eleven stores mostly use the main brands which are more likely to be kosher certified, other stores may use generic-brands that are not necessarily kosher certified. If the dispenser is shared among more than one flavor, and you cannot confirm that they are all kosher, it is recommended to run the machine until there is no residue of the previous flavor before filling your cup.

Is it permitted to drink plain coffee (or tea with a hechsher) at a Starbucks and the like?

You have the obligation to publicize that you found this stroller in a way that the owner would find out about it (WhatsApp groups would not suffice under normal circumstances as not everyone has WhatsApp).
After a couple of days go by after you would assume that the owner found out where they lost it or who they can contact to receive their stroller back, you may:
1) Write down:
▪ Any Simanim that there is on the stroller;
▪ The time and place it was found.
2) Three people should evaluate the price and write it down.
From then on one can use the item for oneself.
If or when – with the coming of Moshiach, certainly the matter will be resolved – the owner should show up and give you the accurate details of the lost object, you are obligated to give them the amount it was worth at the time of the loss.","###question

 Does a garment that is 100% wool need to be checked for Shatnez?,"Yes.
According to American federal law, garments must have a label which lists the exact content of the fabric. However, this refers only to the material of the main shell fabric of the garment, but not to any threads or materials in the linings, backings, reinforcements, ornaments, padding, loops, fillings and other internal components. Thus, a label which states that the garment is 100% wool can contain as much as 2% of other materials and thus be shatnez.
Furthermore, the government is extremely lax in enforcing these laws. There isn’t also much concern for potential liability resulting from adverse reactions to the fabric, as fabric allergies are uncommon and usually not that serious. Many clothing manufacturers and distributors don’t bother therefore to identify accurately which fibers they use. They are may even deliberately misrepresent the information in order to boost their sales, since they know that they don’t much to fear from law enforcement agencies or other potential liabilities.
This is true even in places where such laws are in place. Many garments are manufactured in labor-cheap, third-world countries where mislabeling is common practice.","###question

" Is it Minhag Chabad to begin Shnayim Mikra on Thursday night?

"I have learned in Kitzur Shulchan Aruch Siman 12 that “If you are traveling and reach the place where you wish to lodge, and ahead of you within a distance of four mil . . you must go four mil ahead in order to pray with the congregation”, How does that work with nowadays cars, and easy transportation?
In my particular case regarding Mincha, there is a minyan about 15 minutes away from where I work, stopping my work, traveling, davening, and returning to my work would take around 40 minutes.
Is this halachically required or can I daven myself at my place of work?
More generally, are there principles by which I can figure out what to do in other cases?","
Traveling to Daven with a Minyan
One must travel 18 or 24 minutes (a shiur of a mil) each way in order to daven with a minyan. Therefore, if one has a car, he should travel 24 minutes by car each way (all together 48 minutes). If one does not have a car and is walking, he should walk 24 minutes each way (all together 48 minutes).
If one is traveling and the minyan is on the way he must travel up to 72 minutes. Some say 96 minutes.
If one will incur a loss of money by attending a minyan, one is allowed to skip that minyan. However, foregoing potential profit/revenue is not considered a loss.
For general laws about this subject see the Alter Rebbe’s Shulchon Aruch 90:17.
Davening with the Minyan from afar
Regarding a case where one can’t make it to a minyan under the above circumstances, he should aim to daven at the time that the tzibur is davening for this time is an eis ratzon. He will not be yotze tevillah btzibur, but it’s still an accomplishment. Ibid 90:10.
However one may not answer דברים שבקדושה if there are unclean areas between him and the minyan davening. The same applies to answering Amen on brochos as well. Ibid 90:11.
Regarding answering on the phone, one may answer Amen and all devarim shebikdusha, and there is no need to be concerned about unclean areas in between, provided there is no delay (as is common on websites with live webcams) between the bracha and Amen. However, it may not be used to be yotze havdalah or other obligations.","###question

"In order to fulfill the mitzva of זכור את השבת לקדשו according to what the מכילתא brings, by saying “יום ראשון בשבת” – Do I need to say “בשבת” or is “יום ראשון” enough because I’m obviously counting to/from Shabbos?
Also, does it apply to writing also?","
An introductory comment: 
This mitzvah is already accomplished by saying the shir shel yom and there is no requirement to say it again throughout the day. Furthermore, the Rebbe suggests that the obligation, which is accomplished by saying so once a day as mentioned, exists only when anyhow counting the days of the week. The Rebbe adds that it appears that the custom isn’t in accordance with this opinion.
Nonetheless, it appears that according to this opinion there would at least be a מצוה קיומית when counting to Shabbos.
As to your questions: 
While many sources specify saying “Yom Rishon b’Shabbos”, it’s possible that saying just “Yom Rishon” is sufficient. Perhaps, the actual count to Shabbos is achieved by saying just “Yom Rishon”, however, it is lacking the mitzvah to mention Shabbos daily.
There is a machlokes if this mitzvah applies in writing too. The common custom, among Gedolei Yisroel too, is not to be particular about writing specifically the weekday count in letters (in contrast to the monthly count).","###question

" For business purposes, 3 Jews purchase a hotel. They have a managing company managing it. In the hotel there is a Treif restaurant. Is that an issue?","There is a prohibition of doing business with non-kosher food, in addition to the prohibition of benefiting from some issurim (such as milk and meat mixtures). The best solution is to rent out the restaurant space to a non-Jew, and the non-Jew runs the restaurant and pays a fixed amount as rent for the space. So advises Chelkas Binyamin 117:8.
[There is an additional problem of Shabbos operations and revenues. These matters can be dealt with by making a partnership with a non-Jew and drafting a contract which arranges that all Shabbos and Yom Tov revenues will be for the non-Jewish partner. This contract needs to be drafted with a Rav who is expert in this field.
(On a side note, managing a hotel on Shabbos is only allowed when it is done in an area which is not in a Techum Shabbos. If a business is within Techum Shabbos of the Jewish community, which means that it is within the city where one is allowed to walk on Shabbos to a place where Jewish people live and have a shul, there is a problem of Maris Ayin even if all the activities would be done by non-Jews. People will say that Jews operate a business and make money on Shabbos, even if all the work is done by non-Jews. See Shulchan Aruch Admur Hazaken (O.C. 244:1-3)). However, if there is a partnership and the non-Jew makes all the Shabbos and Yom Tov revenue, and it is not public knowledge that Jews “own the hotel”, then there is no מראית עין problem.
Thus this matter could depend on if the well majority of the hotel guests are non-Jewish and if the area is not a “Jewish area”. For these reasons, one would also not need to affix mezuzos on the doors.)","###question

The best solution is to rent out the restaurant space to a non-Jew, and the non-Jew runs the restaurant and pays a fixed amount as rent for the space. So advises Chelkas Binyamin 117:8.
[There is an additional problem of Shabbos operations and revenues. These matters can be dealt with by making a partnership with a non-Jew and drafting a contract which arranges that all Shabbos and Yom Tov revenues will be for the non-Jewish partner. This contract needs to be drafted with a Rav who is expert in this field.
(On a side note, managing a hotel on Shabbos is only allowed when it is done in an area which is not in a Techum Shabbos. If a business is within Techum Shabbos of the Jewish community, which means that it is within the city where one is allowed to walk on Shabbos to a place where Jewish people live and have a shul, there is a problem of Maris Ayin even if all the activities would be done by non-Jews. People will say that Jews operate a business and make money on Shabbos, even if all the work is done by non-Jews. See Shulchan Aruch Admur Hazaken (O.C. 244:1-3)). However, if there is a partnership and the non-Jew makes all the Shabbos and Yom Tov revenue, and it is not public knowledge that Jews “own the hotel”, then there is no מראית עין problem.
Thus this matter could depend on if the well majority of the hotel guests are non-Jewish and if the area is not a “Jewish area”. For these reasons, one would also not need to affix mezuzos on the doors.)"

" Can I Say “Thank G-d”?
I work in a field where I interact almost exclusively with Goyim. When a client asks me “How are your doing” is it Mutar to answer “Thank G-d”? Or is it saying Shaim Hashem l’vatala?
Saying “Thank G-d Alm-ghty” (as the Rebbe seems to append whenever he says “G-d”) would come across as bizarre in a typical professional exchange. If it is forbidden, is there an alternative for Boruch Hashem in English?","
It is forbidden to answer “Thank G-d”. As it is considered saying Shem Shomayim l’vatalah.
Adding the word A-mighty doesn’t make it acceptable either; rather, it’s considered saying two names of Hashem l’vatalah. Some suggest saying “Thank the L-rd”, but not everybody considers this an acceptable option either. As for the Rebbe saying often “May G-d A-mighty bless you”, see below in the references.
There are many alternatives and you may choose whatever you are most comfortable with. For example, “Thank the One above”; “Thank G, O, D” (pronouncing the actual letters), or “Thank Him” (pointing upwards). You can choose any variation of the above, or other original ideas.
You should however not try to avoid thanking Him by using secular alternatives, such as “Thank Goodness”, as there is a Mitzvah to thank Hashem for everything.
May I add that the fact that it might sound bizarre shouldn’t be a concern; on the contrary, it is an opportunity to be Mekadesh Shem Shomayim and explain where possible and relevant your behavior, in order to show reverence to G-d, and in line with Halacha, Jewish law. Society nowadays respects people who live up to their values; bizarreness often provides an added dimension of intrigue leading to more respect and even awe.
As to your comment about Ama D’bar (the common custom of society at large) saying it, this is unfortunately true. Indeed, when Poskim caution against such behavior, they make mention of the fact that society is ignorant of this Halacha. However, it is noteworthy that the previous Rebbe remarked on this practice as follows: When a simple Jew says Gimmel Aleph Tes (G-o-t, the Yiddish equivalent of G-d) Atzmus (the very essence of Hashem) is speaking, but when a Ben-Torah says so it is [merely] a name of Hashem. Great caution is required when saying Hashem’s name.

 Is it OK to go to the Ohel at night?,"Question:
Is it OK to go to the Ohel at night?
How about not eating; I can’t eat all day, or it’s OK not to eat just from Shkiah?
Answer
The common custom is not to go to a Beis Hakvaros at night. While many have written extensively on this topic, proving that there’s no issue whatsoever with going at night, we find in the writings of the Minchas Elazar that one is supposed to go to Davka by day.
Nonetheless, there is no halachic prohibition to go at night. Indeed, many people do go at night, especially when going to Kivrei Tzadikm. When going at night, one shouldn’t say Chapters of Tehilim.
It is noteworthy, however, that although the Rebbe would frequent the Ohel on a constant basis, as far as we know he never went at night, though many times the visit extended long into the night.
The custom is to drink but not eat before visiting the Ohel.
There is no clear source which discusses this custom vis-a-vis going at night. Some say one may eat straight until sunset. Nonetheless many have the custom not to eat from the morning. At the same time, one should certainly not go on a full stomach.

 Are all watches permissible to be worn on Shabbos? Are they Muktzeh?,"Watches are not Muktzah unless you need to press a button to see the time.
Non-working watch: According to many opinions, if the watch is not working it is Muktzah.
Electrical: Even if the watch contains a computer inside it is not Muktzah, since its main purpose is to display the time. If you know that you are likely to press the button and use the computer, you should not wear it on Shabbos. Likewise, if it has a button to produce light and you might out of habit press it at night, you should put a sticker or something to remind you not to do so on Shabbos. Some put their watch on the other hand to help them remember not to do so on Shabbos.
Room temperature: A watch that displays the room temperature may not be worn, since this watch works only due to the movements of the one wearing the watch. If it measures the temperature but does not display it unless a button is pressed, it may be worn.
Glow in the dark: If a light turns on when you go into a dark room then it is a problem; if it just glows in the dark then it is okay.
Self-winding: Some watches are powered through movement. Although many are lenient, it is best for one not to wear a self-winding watch on Shabbos, because whenever you move your hand it causes the watch to recharge, especially or once you removed it from your hand and want to put it back. Many Poskim agree that it should not be worn on Shabbos once it stopped or if it is not sufficiently recharged to last throughout Shabbos.
Solar-powered: The same applies to a solar-powered watch which will recharge when entering a place which it well lit.
 Kinetic Watch: A kinetic watch operates slightly differently, where instead of a battery, one’s movement generates the needed. This is more severe and should certainly not be worn on Shabbos, especially with kinetic watches with digital displays. All the more so, with an Eco-Drive watch which enters slow down mode when there is no light and returns to normal function (digital displays, correct second hand time, etc.) when exposed to light.
Apple watches or Fitbits are forbidden on Shabbos. Your movements activate the functions and the display, it tracks all your steps, monitors your heartbeat and so much more.
If Shabbos started and you forgot to remove your apple watch, you should take it off right away, preferably by undoing the buckle and dropping it off your hand. One cannot move freely until it’s removed.
Many Chassidim do not wear a watch at all on Shabbos or Yom Tov.

Although many are lenient, it is best for one not to wear a self-winding watch on Shabbos, because whenever you move your hand it causes the watch to recharge, especially or once you removed it from your hand and want to put it back. Many Poskim agree that it should not be worn on Shabbos once it stopped or if it is not sufficiently recharged to last throughout Shabbos.
Solar-powered: The same applies to a solar-powered watch which will recharge when entering a place which it well lit.
 Kinetic Watch: A kinetic watch operates slightly differently, where instead of a battery, one’s movement generates the needed. This is more severe and should certainly not be worn on Shabbos, especially with kinetic watches with digital displays. All the more so, with an Eco-Drive watch which enters slow down mode when there is no light and returns to normal function (digital displays, correct second hand time, etc.) when exposed to light.
Apple watches or Fitbits are forbidden on Shabbos. Your movements activate the functions and the display, it tracks all your steps, monitors your heartbeat and so much more.
If Shabbos started and you forgot to remove your apple watch, you should take it off right away, preferably by undoing the buckle and dropping it off your hand. One cannot move freely until it’s removed.
Many Chassidim do not wear a watch at all on Shabbos or Yom Tov.
Regarding wearing a watch outside in a place with no Eruv, see here:

On the subject of eating meat, the Torah is clear that it’s not only permitted, but preferred.

There are other times when eating meat takes on halachic significance.

The requirement of taking lulav. They need to close their fingers or even better lift it. At the very least, according to some opinions, holding it in such a way that it doesn’t fall is also considered taking.
The fact that two people are holding it together: If they hold in such a way that without your support it would not fall and you are just assisting, and reversely, without them holding it, it would fall, it is valid. Otherwise, they should hold it on their own.
There is an issue of kavanah, since the person is just holding it without being conscious of the fact that they are doing a mitzvah. This is only an issue on the first day. (See link below)
Likewise, it might not be considered a kinyan and therefore not theirs. This also is only an issue on the first day, and ideally one should be concerned about this on the second day too.","###question

As a thumb of rule, these blessing were only recited due to the impression these creatures or people had on the one who saw them. In today’s day, these creatures or people are very common and therefore no blessing is said.
(See חיי אדם כלל ס”ג סעי’ א in his Hilchos Birkas Hanehenin. The same can apply to anything that doesn’t make a big impression on us after the time – we no longer make a blessing on it.

• when seeing an elephant, monkey, or ape etc.:
One does recite Meshane Habriyos when seeing them
(the Meiri in Brachos 58 writes that they have certain humanlike similarities*; additionally, regarding monkeys/apes there is also the view that they were humans that were punished after the דור הפלגה),
but only on the very first time one sees the wondrous sight. Thus, if one did not bless then, one may not bless afterwards either.
(Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 226:9. Sefer Birchas Hanehenin 13:13. The Rema ibid. holds that one can recite this blessing every 30 days, but in practice if one were to recite it, Hashem’s name should not be mentioned – Luach Birchas Henehenin 12:21. Mishna Berurah 226 :30. However, this has been completely omitted in Seder Birchas Henehenin ibid.).

From the list of Brachos that Shulchan Aruch says to say when you see something, which ones do we say? Is there a rule about it? Why don’t we say some of them?.
 ###answer 
 
Blossoming tree in Nissan:
Yes.
(As printed also in the Siddur סדר הברכות).
See details here:
Birchas Hailanos
Solar Eclipse
Shooting star/comet:
Yes.
(ibid.)
Fierce winds:
Yes.
Of course, the winds must be very strong, and they cannot start at night.
Source: ibid.; see also Seder Birkas Hanehenin 13:15. See Ketzos Hashulchan 66 footnote 20.
Lightning and thunder:
Yes.
Source: ibid., see also Seder Birkas Hanehenin ibid..
Earthquake:
Yes
(ibid.).
Rainbow:
Yes.
Source: Shulchan Aruch OC 229:1; see also Sefer Haminhagim p. 23.
Seas:
Yes, but only if known that the sea or river exists from the beginning of Creation.

What Brachah do I say when I see a River or an Ocean?
Extra tall mountains:
Yes, but only if the sights are extra wondrous, showing Hashem’s greatness, and not just any mountain
See Ketzos Hashulchan 66:14.
Birchas Hachama:
Yes (Shulchan Aruch OC 229:2).
The place where a Nes (miracle) happened to you or your parents:
Yes.
(Seder Birkas Hanehenin 13:1).
However, one needs to ascertain with a Rav if the “‘miracle” is truly one that the Halacha deems proper to make a blessing on.

I was run over by a car 7 years ago. B”H I am fine. Should I make a Seudas Hoda’ah? If so, what does that entail?
A big Talmid Chacham:
Only if it’s a Talmid Chacham Muflag who is a Gadol Hador – i.e., an exceptionally tremendous Torah sage of the generation. (Seder Birkas Hanehenin 13:8). Though there have been Rabbis in the past who recited this blessing in public, in practice it’s not said. The Rebbe also advised not to say this Brocha upon seeing the previous Rebbe.

What Broches will we have to say when Moshiach will come?
See also references in Piskei Teshuvos 224:4.
A gentile wise person:
This blessing is not recited in today’s day, since it is almost impossible that a wise gentile would be expert in all the seven wisdoms.
(see Mishna Berurah 224:10).
A gentile king:
Yes, but only if it’s a king who can sentence the death penalty.
(see Mishna Berurah 224:12).
If he can’t, the blessing is said without Hashem’s name.
(deduced from Mishna Berurah ibid.; see also Sha’arei Habracha p. 483 footnote 20).

Should someone make the Brocha שנתן מכבודו לבשר ודם on President Trump?
“Meshane Habriyos” / “Dayan Haemes”:
• when seeing an African American, American Indian, dwarf, etc., or someone whose legs are missing, is blind, or is afflicted with pimples:
As a thumb of rule, these blessing were only recited due to the impression these creatures or people had on the one who saw them. In today’s day, these creatures or people are very common and therefore no blessing is said.
(See חיי אדם כלל ס”ג סעי’ א in his Hilchos Birkas Hanehenin. The same can apply to anything that doesn’t make a big impression on us after the time – we no longer make a blessing on it.
ולהעיר שבסדר ברה״נ יג, יב, השמיט כל הדוגמאות לברכה זו, אף שהביאם בלוח ברה״נ יב, כ.
• when seeing an elephant, monkey, or ape etc.:
One does recite Meshane Habriyos when seeing them
(the Meiri in Brachos 58 writes that they have certain humanlike similarities*; additionally, regarding monkeys/apes there is also the view that they were humans that were punished after the דור הפלגה),
but only on the very first time one sees the wondrous sight. Thus, if one did not bless then, one may not bless afterwards either.
(Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 226:9. Sefer Birchas Hanehenin 13:13. The Rema ibid. holds that one can recite this blessing every 30 days, but in practice if one were to recite it, Hashem’s name should not be mentioned – Luach Birchas Henehenin 12:21. Mishna Berurah 226 :30. However, this has been completely omitted in Seder Birchas Henehenin ibid.).
Also note that the Nimukei Orach Chayim (225) implies that if one goes to a zoo, a couple blessings can be made, so one should not have in mind to exempt everything with one blessing.
*See also Ketzos Hashulchan 66 footnote 15 who also brings from the Talmud to make a blessing on various birds that have slight resemblances of humanlike shaped faces.
On a side note, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach Z”L (quoted in Sha’arei Habracha p. 488) held that one can also recite a blessing on any strange looking animal.
וראה שיחת כ’ חשוון תשד”מ סעיף לז והערה 4 שם וכן שיחת ש”פ תולדות תשד”מ סעיף כג, שזהו מהטעמים להליכה לגן חיות.

Every person is required to give gifts or money of at least a nominal sum to two poor people on Purim. The obligation can be fulfilled through any type of gift: money, food or clothing.

It is customary to be lenient when it comes to the touch of young children who have not reached the age of Chinuch. Although the Neshama of a child is considered fully developed when they reach Bar or Bas Mitzvah, the process of Neshama entry begins when the child starts their Chinuch education.
The process really starts even earlier, with the mitzvah of Mila. Therefore, someone who is careful about the touching of a male infant from the day of Milah onward is considered “holy”.
With a baby girl this applies from when she is born or from when she is given a name.","###question

 At which point must the Chazzan wait for at least six to be with the Minyan before continuing?,"In order to be considered Tefilah B’Tzibur there need to be at least six men davening Shmonah Esrei together.

There is a Muslim there saying a blessing while the Jews are doing the Kosher slaughtering. Also it is made sure that the animal is facing the Qibla (Muslim direction of prayer). They make sure that a horizontal cut is made not a vertical cut, in accordance with Islamic law.. All Jewish laws of slaughter and Muslim laws of slaughter are followed.

 Why do some people not drink red wine between 6 and 7 on friday?,"White wine: There is a custom not to make kiddush on Friday nights between 6 and 7. The original sources make no mention of red wine specifically; likewise, the explanations provided for the custom do not link it with the color of wine either. The accepted interpretation is that this applies to all types of wine, and according to many – even if one makes kiddush on bread.
The reason for this custom: the Gemara tells us that the hours of the day are associated with the seven Mazalos, constellations or planets – Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, each one operating hour of the day in a rotating system; these celestial forces have influence on this world during their corresponding hour. During this hour of 6-7, the constellation of Tzedek (and its corresponding angel Tzadkiel) ceases to be dominant and the constellation of Maadim takes over. Maadim (and its corresponding angel, Samael, pronounced usually as “the Samach Mem”, the source of evil who rules over this Mazal), -the mazal identified with the Esav (Edom), Amalek and Haman- is associated with negative influences and is said to be the cause of destruction, plagues, murder, sickness, and punishment, among other such causes. The Gemara tells us that those born during the hour of Maadim have a tendency towards becoming a Shochet or Mohel, a profession involving bloodshed.
Thus, it’s recommended to avoid acceptance of Shabbos through kiddush in the times when Maadim dominates, so as not to add spiritual energy to Maadim. The reason for the partcular caution when making kiddush because Chazal tell us that two angels accompany people on their way back home from shule on Friday night—a good angel and an evil angel. If the house has been prepared (the candle lit, the table set etc.), the good angel gives a blessing that the next Shabbos will be the same, and the evil angel is forced to respond Amen.

It is not a Halachah but a Minhag.
Some say only the first Shabbos, some say the first 4 Shabbosim.
Some say the whole first year the new Sefer Torah should be used. The reason being that when the Ba’al Koreh is reading from the Torah the congregation will hear if he missed a word or if pronounced mistakenly etc. and with that check to see if it has any mistakes (according to this it doesn’t make a difference if it is a bar mitsvah boy who is reading or not, as it’s not about the Tzuras Ha’oisios, that only a sofer or a rav would know).
Rumor has it that in 770 after the Moshiach sefer Torah was finished and they started reading from it every week, the Rebbe mentioned that there are also other sifrei Torah in the Aron. From then on they would ask the Rebbe every week which Torah to use.
Therfore, it’s indeed appropriate (that after the first 4 weeks have passed) not to neglect the first Sefer Torah entirely, rather to make rotations.
In order to keep to the above mentioned minhag it’s advisable to have the rotation in such a way that the new Sefer Torah would be entirely read through within 2 or 3 years etc.","###question

Therfore, it’s indeed appropriate (that after the first 4 weeks have passed) not to neglect the first Sefer Torah entirely, rather to make rotations.
In order to keep to the above mentioned minhag it’s advisable to have the rotation in such a way that the new Sefer Torah would be entirely read through within 2 or 3 years etc."

There is a 3 way partnership all Jewish and one of them is the manager of the store do I need to get from all 3 of them Mechiras Chometz for the store or just the manager? (The other 2 do not work in the store).
Answers:
1. Mechiras Chometz should be done even if he will still be working in the store during Pesach. but you should tell them that they cannot use the Chometz during Pesach.
2. It would depend on the agreement between the partners;
If the manager has full control and right to do as he wishes with the store – he can sell the Chometz on behalf of the store.
If he cannot do as he wishes – all the partners have to give their consent to the Mechiras Chometz. If it is not possible for you to get in touch with the other partners, Mechiras Chometz should be done regardless.

 Is an oven with Cook-time or Stop-time Mode acceptable for Shabbos use?,"There are many ovens on the market, and it is impossible in this short space to investigate and address every single model. The best we can do is provide a summary of the many issues to look out for. It is important that you read through the manuals of any model you are considering for purchase, in order to determine whether, and to what degree, the issues outlined below apply.
Thermostat:
The main problem with using a oven on Shabbos is the thermostat, which is affected by opening or closing the oven while the oven is on. When the oven door is opened, the thermostat will detect the cold air that rushes in and will activate the heating element if it is off at that moment. It is forbidden to cause this to occur, even if all the food will be removed all at once before the oven door is re-closed. [If the oven door is re-closed with some of the food remaining inside, there may be additional concerns of Bishul on Shabbos, depending on the circumstances.]  The thermostat is not a concern for Yom Tov use, but there are additional problems with a oven on Yom Tov as detailed below.
If the oven is off, like after the cook-time or stop time has finished this would not be an issue.
the problem with using such an oven on Yom Tov is primarily a practical one; most modern ovens have an auto shut-off feature that turns the oven off after around 6-12 hours. Yet another problem, applicable on both Shabbos and Yom Tov, is that many models have lights or fans that are activated and deactivated as the door is opened or closed. In summary, a modern oven without Sabbath Mode may be completely unusable on Shabbos and Yom Tov.
Ovens with “Sabbath Mode”:
Buying an oven with Sabbath Mode will alleviate many of these problems. Sabbath Mode will generally disable the oven’s display panel and any electronic controls, as well as disengage the fans and lights from being activated by opening and closing the oven door. The Sabbath Mode feature will also disable the auto shut-off feature. However, one very big problem, at least with regards to most models, is that the thermostat usually remains operative. [Some ovens have a light which illuminates when the heating element is on, in which case the oven could theoretically be opened when the light is on. However, it has been demonstrated through rigorous testing that these indicator lights are generally inaccurate, and may be illuminated even when the heating element is off.]
The thermostat does not present a problem for Yom Tov use, but makes it completely forbidden on Shabbos, according to most opinions. The outcome is that, ironically, the Sabbath Mode oven remains forbidden for Shabbos use, and is permitted only on Yom Tov. Perhaps it would have been more apt to name this feature “Yom Tov Mode”.
There is a practical workaround for Shabbos use that is easy and simple: Estimate about what time the main course will be served, and make sure that the oven turns off before then. This is generally easy to achieve, as the Sabbath Mode feature can usually be set to turn the oven off in any increment amount of time up until 72 or 96 hours. So, you can easily set the oven to go off after 2 or 3 hours, for example. Once the oven is off, opening the door does not create a problem with regards to the thermostat.
However, this method will usually create a new problem, which requires its own workaround. Now that the oven is off, this means that Sabbath Mode is now deactivated as well, and opening the door will turn the light on (if the oven has a light). This can be circumvented before Shabbos by manipulating the magnets or levers that detect whether the door is open. The specific manner of circumvention will vary from model to model, and in the case of magnetic detectors, may take some trial-and-error. Some oven doors are designed to be taken apart to allow proper cleaning of all the glass panes, and the magnet can be physically removed from the door. In other models, it may work to place a strong and thin magnet on the oven wall at the correct place.(The location of the oven’s magnet can usually be detected by sliding a paperclip around the top of the oven door.) These options may or may not work, depending on the model, so you would have to try before Shabbos, when you have the time and patience to troubleshoot it. [Note: Disabling the magnetic sensor only helps with regards to the functions controlled by the door sensor, such as the oven light and fans. However, the thermostat is not controlled by the door sensor, which is why the oven needs to be off before opening the door on Shabbos.]
Following the advice above, when Shabbos is followed by Yom Tov, one would have to choose whether to reserve the oven’s use for Shabbos or Yom Tov, as using it on Shabbos would require the oven to be set to turn off on Shabbos, in which case it will remain off for the duration of Yom Tov as well.
The Issur of Sheiyah with regards to an oven:
The above answer focuses purely on using the oven itself. However, there are also restrictions about which foods may be placed in an oven before Shabbos without a Blech, and much discussion about whether, and how, a Blech can be facilitated in an oven. Here is a brief summary of the issues:
From the Torah perspective, one may place food over an open flame before Shabbos in order that it cooks on Shabbos. Nevertheless, Chazal forbade this due to the concern that a person may come to stoke the fire on Shabbos in order to speed up the cooking process. This prohibition is knownas Shehiya.
One method of avoiding Shehiya is to cover the flames, typically with a Blech. Covering the fire indicates that one does not desire a strong flame, it diverts his attention from the fire, and it serves as a reminder not to increase the flames. With regards to an oven, there is a dispute whether – and how – a Blech can be adequately created. In practice, a Blech in an oven should be situated so that it covers the heating elements, which may be located either at the top of the oven, the bottom or the backwall. In many ovens, there are heating elements in all of these places.
Another way of addressing Shehiya, and to sidestep the need for a Blech, is to ensure that the food is cooked prior to Shabbos. It is sufficient if the food is already half cooked.  This fraction does not represent time, but rather, is qualitative and measured against the degree of cooking most people would regard as fully cooked. Nevertheless, for a number of reasons, it is best that the food be fully baked before Shabbos.
There is yet a third possible way to circumvent the prohibition of Shehiya. Chazal allowed one to put completely raw meat on an open flame just before the onset of Shabbos. They were not concerned that one might come to stoke the flames, because doing so would not serve any productive purpose – it would not ready the meat in time for the Friday night meal, nor would it be necessary to ready the meat in time for the Shabbos day meal. This leniency is known as “Kidra Chaysa” – literally: raw pot. (Indeed, some people may wish to put raw chicken and rice right before Shabbos to slow bake in the oven for the daytime Seudas Shabbos.)
In order for this leniency to apply, two criteria must be met. First, the food item must be one that takes a relatively long time to cook properly (such as meat). Second, the food must be put on the fire just before Shabbos, late enough that it will not begin cooking before Shabbos comes in. Some contemporary Poskim therefore assert that this leniency seldom applies nowadays, because most modern cooking appliances are able to cook in a relatively short amount of time. As a case in point, meat put up to cook rightat the  onset of Shabbos would usually be fit for consumption by the time the meat course  arrives. Even if the heat is set to low, this does not diminish the oven’s overall ability to bake quickly, because the seat heating can be easily raised. Thus, according to these Poskim, this option is not applicable to a modern oven.
Other associated issues:
1. It should be pointed out that even when the oven is off and cold, if it will be turned on with a Shabbos clock or a timer (see next point), one may not place inside any food which is not completely cooked. Furthermore, even completely cooked food that has cooled down may not be placed inside either, unless the food is completely dry (and will remain dry when heated). The same applies to an oven which will remain off but has  not yet cooled down.
2. With regards to Shabbos clocks in general, the Rebbe writes in a letter (Igros Kodesh Vol 12 page 192): “There are those who are extremely stringent and are even sceptical about the permissibility of using a Shabbos clock… Therefore, I am abstaining from giving this idea in an official capacity.” Even so, it is reported that the Rebbe instructed some individuals that they may be used (See Shulchan Menachem Volume 2 page 173).  At the same time, many authorities who permit Shabbos clocks in general nevertheless rule that they should not be used with regards to cooking specifically, for a number of reasons.

 In which tone should Shmoneh Esreh be recited?,"
Here is a quote from the Alter Rebbe’s Shulchan Aruch (OCH 101:2):
“One should not pray in his heart alone. Rather, he should articulate the words with his lips and whisper them audibly [the literal translation of the original would be: “make them heard by his ears”]. He should not, however, make his voice heard (by someone standing more than four cubits away), as it is written [regarding Chanh in I Shmuel 1:13] , “Only her lips were moving, but her voice was not heard.” A person who projects his voice during She­moneh Esreh is one of those whose faith is meager — as if the Holy One, blessed be He, would not hear a whispered prayer. (The Sages ordained that Shemoneh Esreh should be uttered in an absolute whisper, i.e., it should be heard by one’s own ears alone, so as not to embarrass transgressors who confess their sins when praying.)
Now, the Zoher and some Mekubalim (referenced in Likkutei Sichos vol. 35 in the Sicha (1) for Parshas Vayigash) hold that although one must verbalize his words, it should still be done completely quietly that even one himself shouldn’t hear himself. (This is because uncording to Kabbalah She­moneh Esreh is an expression of the highest level of Bittul where one’s entire being is completely nullified, thus his voice isn’t heard).
I have yet to find any reliable source which says that in this case we should follow the mekubalim, and there are Poskim (also brought by the Rebbe in that Sicha) who write that this instruction of the Arizal was a horoah l’yochid, and wasn’t directed to the public.

Being that the screen is pasul for schach, that renders the area of schach directly under the screen invalid. One would therefore need to estimate that if one were to remove those areas of schach which is directly under each wire, whether the sukkah would still have more shade than sun.

I found this discussed in שבת הקהתי ה, קו and he seems to say it’s fine. I’m not sure if his svoro/psak is correct. Is his psak accurate? Can it be done?
See attached pic of enclosure and the tshuva..
 ###answer 
 
Being that the screen is pasul for schach, that renders the area of schach directly under the screen invalid. One would therefore need to estimate that if one were to remove those areas of schach which is directly under each wire, whether the sukkah would still have more shade than sun.
See below for a detailed discussion."

 Are we allowed to take showers on a Three day Yom Tov?,"Firstly, the allowances given here to showering on Yom Tov is only when the following conditions are met:
a) One will assure not to run into the problem of סחיטה (squeezing) by their wet hair. That is to be careful from squeezing one’s hair from the washing till the drying. Therefore putting a soap or shampoo on the hair may not be done.
b) There is no allowance to use bar soaps since that is considered Me’machek (see Mishna Berurah 326:30). 
c) No fire can be lit or activated by turning on the shower faucet, therefore if the boiler was lit before Yom Tov that should help. However every case needs to be individually checked how the hot water system works in the shower.
Cold water shower on Yom Tov –
It is permissible to take a cold water shower (when fulfilling the conditions mentioned above) when a person is in great pain. See Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 326:1 & Alter Rebbe Shulchan Aruch ibid. The Alter Rebbe (ibid:6) concludes that it is the custom not to wash (bath in the outdoor lakes) even in cold water even when there is no prohibition attached to it. The Aruch Hashulchan (326:9) writes on this, “one who breaks this safeguard imposed by the Rishonim [custom of refraining from bathing in rivers, lakes and ponds] , on him it says ‘one who breaks the fence should be bitten by a snake’…”
With that said, the Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasa 14:11 (source is from Hagaos R. Akiva Eiger 326) brings that a person in pain may have a cold wash, the reasons is since if it is not in a lake, rather just a shower there are less concerns in Halacha.
One should not do this in a public setting like a mikvah. (People might not understand or think that one can also freely use hot water as well.) See Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 511:2.
Follow up Question on Showers on Yom Tov
Hot water shower on Yom Tov –
The Alter Rebbe (Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 511:1) after bringing a more lenient view, concludes that the custom follows like the view (Rema 511:2) that forbids one to wash his whole body in hot water that was heated on Yom Tov. This is since washing every day is not שוה לכל נפש  (necessary for every person) and adds that even if it was heated before Yom Tov we still are to forbid the washing of the whole body by way of decree.
Today it is regular to shower daily, so some Poskim are lenient in extenuating circumstances (where cold water for some reason is not able to clean them) see Mishna Berurah (511:18) allows hot water even if it was heated on Yom Tov. However, as mentioned, the Alter Rebbe does not allow this. Therefore one can wash limb by limb in warm water. when the water is heated before Yom Tov. One should turn on the faucet to wash the face, hands and feet, and can keep the water on to continue washing the rest of the limbs. See Alter Rebbe ibid in the parenthesis.
Little children – 
As mentioned, the Alter Rebbe seems to be stringent (by way of custom even with little children who sometimes do not bathe every day), therefore it is best to wash a child limb by limb as mentioned above. If this is not possible, it seems that in extenuating circumstances for example the child could get bad rashes, one can rely on the Mishna Berurah (511:18) who allows to wash a child in hot water on Yom Tov. This would be if it is not possible to wash the little child limb by limb. The water would need to be heated before Yom Tov.","###question

 Is one allowed to eat food that was left in a basket underneath a stroller while the baby was sleeping?,"The Alter Rebbe writes (Hilchos Shemiras Guf V’Nefesh 7) that one should not place a cooked dish or other foods or drinks under a bed because of the רוח רעה (evil spirit) then rests on them even if they are covered in an iron box.
With that said, there is room for leniency בדיעבד (after the fact) with food left underneath a stroller while the baby is sleeping in it for the following reasons:
Some Poskim hold that the reason of the evil spirit resting on the food (underneath a bed) is only when the bed belongs to one who if they would touch food it would cause impurity to the food if they did not first do Netilas Yadaim. Since there is some leniency (after the fact) with the touching of little babies without Netilas Yadaim (see Alter Rebbe Orach Chayim Mehadura Basra Shulchan Aruch 4:2) to food, that rule would say the same here as well. (Note, that the Alter Rebbe in the parenthesis adds that it is proper to be stringent from the touching of a child from his Bris Milah.)
The Darkei Teshuva (Yoreh Deah 116:137) brings that the problem of placing food underneath a bed is only when it is only the floor beneath it literally קרקע שתחתי’ ממש. This is not the case by a basket underneath a stroller.
The Darkei Teshuva ibid:138 brings the Sefer Mili Dichasidusa who holds that the problem of placing food under a bed is when there is marital relations on the bed.
Additionally, there are poskim that are always lenient in cases of bedieved.
Based on all these three reasons the Minchas Yitzchak (4:117) holds one can even be lenient even initially. However, it seems that based on the wording of the Alter Rebbe in both places (Shemiras Guf V’nefesh and Mehadura Basra) that one should be stringent at least initially.
Also, a stroller is not an ordinary bed. Its primary purpose is for taking a walk and short naps.
Thus, there is strong room to be lenient even initially and certainly after the fact.","###question

There is a Machlokes HaPoskim if one may daven Mincha after Shkiah. The Alter Rebbe is of the position that we shouldn’t protest those who do daven after Shkiah. This doesn’t imply that it’s the right thing to do LeChatchillah.
Chassidim generally were very particular to ensure they finish Mincha before Shkiah. Notwithstanding the plethora of the Minyanim in 770, this is the right thing to do. There are unfortunately occasionally other minyanim in 770 which are not fully consistent with Zemanei Teffilah.
Even according to the position that one may daven after Shkiah, if faced with a choice of a Minyan after Shkiah or davening without a Minyan before Shkiah, some maintain that it’s better to daven B’Yechidus.
It is well known that the Rebbeim were so particular about this that they davened before Shkiah without a Minyan even when they had Yahrtzeit rather than davening after Shkiah. In the earlier years, the Rebbe did this several times too.
Certainly, in a place which has no such Minyanim this would be a breach of custom to introduce something like this, a matter which is highly questionable. There is a very simple solution to your situation: make it a habit of always coming on time to Shule. Your reluctance or difficulty to change your habit should not result in the community changing their standards and accommodating a behavior which is highly questionable.

" Is ripping toilet paper, not on the lines, permissible on Shabbos? If yes, why is it not under the Melacha of Korea? ","
One is not allowed to tear paper towels on shabbos, even not on the perforated line.
Regarding toilet paper, where no other other choice exists, one may rip the toilet paper, not on the perforated line.
It is recommended to rip the toilet paper with a Shinui. Ripping toilet paper with the left hand is not considered a Shinui.
This should not be relied on under ordinary circumstances; only where toilet paper was not prepared before Shabbos and it’s allowed only in order to preserve human dignity.
Reasoning:
The issue of ripping toilet paper isn’t a issue of Korea, since it’s one piece paper. Korea is a Melacha that only applies to items that are attached or sewn like clothes etc. there could be an issue of Mechatech, if it’s being ripped into a specific size. Even when not in a specific size there can be an issue – like in the above mentioned – of Tikun Kli, of fashioning an item for use. However, this can be permitted in a situation of K’vod HaBrios, specially if done with a Shinui – See below for an elaboration.

 Is there any reason why women don’t do Mayim Achronim?,"Strictly speaking, there is no difference between men and women. Nonetheless, the custom has developed that women are lenient in this matter.
The suggested explanation for the leniency among women is because nowadays washing Mayim Acharonim is considered as a Chumra and women haven’t taken it upon their self.
More specifically, there are generally three reasons for washing Mayim Acharonim:
A concern for a particular type of salt which when touches the eye can cause blindness.
Because the hands are dirty from food and one may not Bentch reciting Hashem’s name with dirty hands.
According to Kabalah, the purpose of Mayim Acharonim is to give the “other side” (evil forces) a small portion of the meal so that they don’t prosecute against us.
The Poskim mention that there are those who are not accustomed to wash because this type of salt is no longer common. As for the dirty hands, since nowadays people are not particular to wash their hands after meals, thus this wouldn’t be considered an obstacle to Benching. An additional explanation (mentioned specifically with regards to women) is that they are careful to eat with spoons and forks, and their hands do not touch the actual food. As for the Kabbalistic reason, women generally are not accustomed to follow Kabbalistic practices. Therefore, since washing Mayim Acharonim nowadays is considered an extra stringency women have not adopted this practice.
Of course, the above is only an explanation of an existing custom common among women. Clearly, if a woman knows her hands are dirty she may not Bentch without washing her hands first. Even absent the dirty hands, it is recommended – but not obligatory – that woman always wash Mayim Acharonim, without calling attention to her practice.","###question

" Is a woman permitted to tub bathe and/or swim on an Onas Prisha?
Rav Braun, I am writing to ask if you can please clarify the issue of tub bathing and swimming on an Onas Prisha – both Onah Beinonis and the other Onos (Haflagah and Chodesh).
We have been taught that this is not permitted lechatchilla (nor is internal washing) and if the need is great to swim or bathe (in tub, not shower) that one should ask a Rav, which usually results in being told to do a bedikah prior to swimming or tub bathing on an Onas Prisha.
Iwas told that some poskim hold that if a woman did tub bathe or swim (water reachinginternally, which is unavoidable in such cases) on an onah beinonis, on her own, then she would have to start sheva nekiim over again. The Alter Rebbe does not hold this way, and if a woman did do this, she would not have to begin her count again.
We would like to confirm the issue. Namely, is a woman permitted to tub bathe and/or swim on an Onas Prisha, and in particular on the Onah Beinonis (or a kavuah) at all, or is a bedikah required beforehand, or nothing is required and it is not an issue.","

There are certain poskim that are lenient because you started the treatment before Shabbos. According to this opinion it’s was certainly ok. But preferably one should avoid relying on this.
If the pain is strong that it causes a general weakness, one may take medication regardless. If there is great pain but it doesn’t cause a general weakness, it should be done with a shinui, with the left hand for example.
If you put just clean water, it’s not a issue and you don’t need a shinui.

One more point to add: a Shabbos bendel may only be worn if there is no belt on the garment. If, however, there is already a belt on the blouse you can’t put a Shabbos bendel on it, but you can put a sweater on and put the Shabbos bendel on top of the sweater (if you wear a belt on sweaters on occasion).

" When should one get his hair cut before Shavuos this year, since Erev Shavuos is Shabbos?","It is a Mitzvah to have hair cut before every Yom Tov, so as not to enter into Yom Tov unkempt. The prohibition of haircutting on Chol Hamoed was instituted especially to compel people to receive a haircut prior to Yom Tov and not to postpone it.
The necessity of receiving a haircut on erev Shavuos is more acute, because haircutting was prohibited throughout Sefirah. The long hair accumulated over Sefirah causes a disheveled appearance, which is highly inappropriate for any Yom Tov.
Minhag Chabad is to take a haircut only on Erev Shavuos (this includes the preceding night). However, since Erev Shavuos coincides with Shabbos this year, we must cut our hair one day earlier, on erev Shabbos. In his  Kovetz, Rabbi Dvorkin writes: “It is obvious to me for a number of reasons that [when Erev Shavuos  coincides with Shabbos,] one should receive a haircut on Erev Shabbos. In fact, I did so myself. And just as the barber began to cut my hair, his telephone rang –  it was Rabbi Chodakov calling. The barber then asked me if he could go immediately to give the Rebbe a haircut…”.
There has been extensive discussion whether this includes Thursday night as well. In practice, we may be lenient about this matter.

" Can a woman Daven Shacharis past Chatzos? What does she do if she misses the time for Shacharis?
How about on Shabbos when the Amidah for Shabbos differs in each Tefillah? What should she do regarding Shachris and Musaf?
Additionally, on Shabbos, until what point can she eat in the morning? What if she didn’t get to daven at all, can she continue eating throughout the day without having to make Kiddush? (At what point does the obligation to make Kiddush take effect in relation to davening?)","
Although there is room to be Melamed Zechus on those women who are lenient to daven Shacharis after Chatzos, this shouldn’t be done, rather she should daven Mincha saying Shmomei Esrei twice. This applies even on Shabbos when the Tefilah for Shacharis differs from the Amidah for Mincha. However one can daven Musaf until night.
The reason Kiddush is made after davening is because before davening one is not allowed to eat. The prevalent custom is that even those that do eat before davening in order to be able to concentrate better during davening  (as is customary in Chabad), do not make Kiddush beforehand, but only after Shacharis (Musaf).
After Chatzos, the time for Shacharis has passed and one may not daven Shacharis anymore (Musaf could still be davened). Therefore, they would be obligated in Kiddush because the restriction of eating before davening no longer applies (since they are no longer obligated in Shacharis).","###question

Shabbos: This day is Yom-Tov for the traveller but not for the local populace. The traveller should recite the Yom Tov Tefillos and Kiddush (adding the selections for Shabbos), but omit the three words “Zman Matan Toraseinu”.

The Minhag is that Kiddush Levana is not performed under a roof (OC 426:4). There are two reasons for this Minhag:
According to the Bach (OC 426), it is disrespectful when one does not make the effort to leave one’s home and go out to greet the king; how much more so when greeting the Shechinah. [It might be argued that this reason does not apply when in an airplane, where it is impossible to “go out and greet the king”, and staying inside is therefore not an act of disrespect.]
According to the Maharil (cited in Magen Avraham OC 426:14), the concern is that there might be Tumah within the building, and it is appropriate that one should greet the Shechinah in a place which is Tahor.
In any case, the Bach rules that this Minhag applies only where practical. In cases where it is not practical to go outdoors, such as an (even mildly) ill person who is housebound, or someone who is frightened of the reactions of the Gentiles, may recite Kiddush Levana at the window. The Bach’s ruling is brought down by the Taz (OC 426:4) and Magen Avraham (ibid) and other Achronim. The Magen Avraham provides another (more obvious) example – when the outdoors is filthy and not befitting the Bracha.
There is a further discussion in the Poskim whether one may view the moon from behind a (transparent glass or plastic) windowpane. The Pri Megadim (Mishbetzos Zahav OC 426:4) rules that one may do so when it is not possible to open the window, such as in your situation. The Birchei Yosef (OC 426:4) seems to conclude that it is unnecessary to open the window at all. [This particular issue is a far-ranging one in Halacha, and also concerns vision through glasses, but the common practice is to be lenient in this matter, especially when the pane is completely transparent.]","###question

Do you approve of the following?
I recommend to consider that a couple getting married in their early twenties can expect to spend sixty years together, which is about five hundred thousand hours, and therefore should consider spending at least fifty hours getting to know their potential spouse before marrying them. Fifty hours is the equivalent of ten five hour dates and would only be one ten-thousandth of the time that they can expect to spend together. I think that it is obviously very unwise to marry someone without spending at least fifty hours getting to know them, and I recommend to go on at least ten five-hour dates before marrying someone.","
I don’t approve. Aside of the Hashkafah issues, there are some technical flaws in the logic here.
Couples don’t spend 24 hours a day together. That reduces your amount of hours significantly.
There is also no solid evidence that getting to know someone better, or for more time before marriage has bearing on the success rate of the marriage. Even if it does has bearing, as some argue, it’s obvious that serious commitment and shared goals are the ultimate influences on the durability of the marriage.
It should be noted that in many other circles they hardly see each other before marriage and they have a high success rate of lasting marriages. Historically, our ancestors who hardly dated also have a history of longer-lasting marriages.","###question

 May one interrupt while reading Shnayim Mikra?,"The Alter Rebbe (OC 285:6) states that some are accustomed to read the entire week’ s Shnayim Mikra without interruption at all, but that according to the basic Halacha, one may interrupt it and read “one Parsha today . . and another Parsha tomorrow”. [In this context, Parsha refers to a segment of Pesukim in the Torah that appears without any space between the Pesukim, also known as פתוחות וסתומות.]
This implies that if one does not wish to read the entire week’s Shnayim Mikra at once, he may interrupt only when there is a break in the Torah between Parshiyos.
From this it can be inferred that:
1. It is ideal to read the entire week’s Shnayim Mikra without interruption at all.
2. It is acceptable to pause when there is a break in the Torah between Parshiyos.
3. One should not interrupt within a Parsha at all.

" Can my son work in a supermarket that has mostly non-kosher food?
There aren’t many summer jobs available for my young teenage son. Can he work in a supermarket where they have a nice kosher section, but it’s mostly non-kosher food? Are there certain jobs within such a place that are more or less desirable from a Torah perspective?","
It is difficult to answer you properly without knowing you or your son’s religiosity background. In general, a boy in Yeshiva should learn or work in an Orthodox Jewish camp (a boys camp and not mixed with girls). A boy in Yeshiva should continue to learn Torah throughout the summer.
In any case, according to strict Halacha, one is allowed to work in such a market provided that he is not preparing cooked non-kosher food.
Regarding selling non-kosher food, since the Jew does not own the food and does not prepare the food there are many Poskim who hold that the prohibition of selling certain non-kosher food does not apply. There is no concern of possibly eating the non-kosher food when one is working in a market (and not a restaurant) where most of the foods are completely closed and can only be consumed when leaving the store.
However, this is not advisable unless one is pressed desperately for money. The biggest concerns would be possible fraternizing with women, Jewish or להבדיל non-Jewish, and possible Yichud situations.
Therefore it is highly advisable to try to find some sort of job in a Jewish camp as a first choice. It would be advisable to also consult with one’s local Rabbi or Mashpia.","###question

(וצ״ל שבסידור מיירי באופן שאפשר בל״ז. וכנהוג אצלנו בדפיקה וכדומה משא״כ לאלו שאינם יודעים. ומכל מקום כיון שהורה רבינו שלא להפסיק ליעלה ויבוא – קשה למעשה להתיר. אבל י״ל דקאי דוקא בליל ר״ח כמפורש לשונו, שאם שכח אינו חוזר. משא״כ בדבר המחוייב. ולפ״ז יש להתיר להכרזת טל ומטר).
אמנם, בכללות הענין – גם בשו״ת אג״מ (או״ח א, כב) שהתיר להפסיק בפסוד״ז מה״ט – וכן מצינו בכ״מ להתיר בפסוד״ז לצורך מצוה (השלמת המנין, לעלות לדוכן, לעלות לתורה כשאין כהן אלא הוא ואפילו לומר שמו לגבאי, לקרוא בתורה כשאין בעל קורא ולכמה דעות גם מותר לעולה, לתקן טעות הבעל קורא) – כתב שעדיף להתפלל ביחידות ולא להפסיק. ואין סיבה שלא לעשות כן (זולת במקום שהמכריז הוא הש”צ הוא הבעל קורא הוא הגבאי וכו׳ כנהוג בכמה בתי חב”ד).
וכש״כ באמצע ברכות ק״ש שקשה מאד להתיר מדינא. וראה אג״מ או״ח ד, טז. (ויש שכתבו סברות שונות להתיר – ראה קובצי העו״ב תתשכ. תתמו. לכבוד צדיק ב ע׳ 44. התקשרות תשלו ועוד – ולפענ״ד אין לנו להקל יותר ממה שכתבו הפוסקים. ורק באופנים הנזכרים. וכש״כ דאנן בתר אדה״ז גרירין, והחמיר מאד בדיני הפסק. ועיקר סמיכתם על הרשב״א שהתיר להכריז יעו״י, משא״כ לאדה״ז).
בשעת הדחק ממש, ובמקום שיש בו לאפרושי מאיסורא ממש (ולא רק כבנדוננו) ולא צורך מצוה לחוד, כגון שיתפללו תפלת שבת בחג שה״ז ברכה לבטלה, ואין אופן אחר להודיעם – שבדרך כלל כדאי להכין שלטים מראש, ראה אג״מ שם – מותר להכריז גם בברכות ק״ש. (וכן יש שכתבו לגעור או לרמז בבעל קורא שטעה. ולהעיר גם מערוה״ש סו, ד להתיר למורה לענות בדיני או״ה בין הפרקים אם לא כשהשואל בר דעת להמתין. אבל ראה משנ״ב ב)."

" Is one who finds it harmful to eat dairy permitted to eat chicken during the Nine Days?
I saw in Kitzur Shulchon Aruch (122:8) that one who finds it harmful to eat dairy they are permitted to eat meat of a chicken. Is this accurate? If yes, am I permitted to eat chicken as I am highly allergic to all dairy products to the extent where I carry an EpiPen where ever I go, G-d forbid I need it.","
That is correct.
The reason for abstaining from meat during the Nine Days is twofold:
Because meat is associated with joy.
Because meat is reminiscent of the Korbonos which were halted at the time of the Churban.
These reasons don’t apply to the same degree with regards to chicken – it is not associated to the same degree with joy, and because chicken was not offered up as a Korbon.
Although the Minhag is to abstain from chicken nonetheless, and there is absolutely no leniency for a healthy person, the Bach (552:2) and Magen Avraham (551:28) are lenient for a person to whom dairy is harmful. This is because abstaining from all dairy and all meat for a period of nine days would have a detrimental health effect (Shvus Yaakov §36), and is therefore allowed when needed (Oruch Hashulchan 551:24).
The concern of a detrimental health effect certainly loomed large in times bygone when the range of available food was relatively minimal. Therefore, in our times, when there is a wide range of high protein foods, it would be appropriate to avoid poultry as well if you are absolutely certain that this will not lead to detrimental health effects.","###question

 What Brachah do I say when I see a River or an Ocean?,"Article: A Brachah on Rivers
The brachah of Oseh ma’aseh bereishis (thanking Hashem for the wonders of creation) should be recited when we see a large river that has been around since sheishes yemei breishis (the beginning of creation).
However, if the river has changed course, even if it happened biyedei shamayaim (due to a natural act from Above), we don’t say the brachah. When encountering a river, we needn’t be concerned that its course may have changed over time, but if it’s unknown whether the river dates back to sheishes yemei breishis, no brachah should be said. This is one of the reasons that this brachah is seldom recited, since the provenance of most rivers is unknown. Poskim say, though, that there is no concern with saying the brachah if we see very large rivers, such as the Mississippi.
None of the issues concerning rivers apply to oceans; we certainly should make a brachah when seeing an ocean. Upon seeing the “yam hagadol” (the ‘great ocean’), a special brachah, She’asah es (or Oseh) hayam hagadol, ought to be said. However, since we don’t know which ocean bears that name, we say Oseh maaseh breishis instead. Some maintain that the brachah for the yam hagadol should be recited when seeing any ocean which encircles continents, such as the Atlantic Ocean.
These Brachos are only recited once every 30 days.

" What should we do if we forgot to turn off the door chime from the alarm system before Shabbos?
We have a home alarm system and when a window or door is opened (if the alarm is active) it sets off an alarm. If the alarm is off there is a low chime sound when a door is opened or closed. For Shabbas and Yom Tov there is a switch on every door that can take that door out of the alarm circuit, so when the switch is flipped nothing happens when the door opens or shuts.
This week for the first time we forgot to turn off the chime. We realized when the door was open. So the question is, what should have we done in such a situation? Leaving the door open is not safe (it is not the safest of cities). In addition, many bugs and insects are attracted to the light inside. I tried to find a goy to close the door and flip the switch but I was not successful it was late at night. Also when the door is shut can we then flip the switch or should we stay indoors the entire Shabbas?","
If it is possible not to close the door, or not open the door when the chime is activated, that is the proper approach.
If there is an absolute necessity for the door to be opened or closed it can be done with a שינוי a non-regular way of opening/closing the door.

" The AC in our rented apartment broke. Is the landlord obligated to replace it?

Just came back from 10 days away. Don’t have enough clean clothing for the kids and myself. Don’t have enough towels. Can I do Landry?,"Can I also change linens for Shabbos this week?
Can I cut the kids’ nails for Shabbos on Friday?
Answers:
Children’s Clothing:
For little kids that soil their clothing frequently: Clothes may be washed during the nine days. Even for older kids, this year (5779) one may wash their clothing.
Adults clothing:
One should wash the stained area only. If necessary to wash all of it, then if one’s clothes are soiled due to sweat or other spills to the extent that one can not tolerate wearing them, one may wash them till the week of Tisha B’av. This year, where Tisha B’av falls out on Shabbos, if it can’t be washed through a non Jew there is room to be lenient the week before Tisha B’av.
Even in the week of Tisha B’av, if it is so soiled or full of sweat that one is embarrassed to go outside with them, or one considers it repulsive, then one may wash but only the bare minimum clothes necessary. They however should not be worn without putting them first on an earthen floor to remove the freshness. Better to have a non-Jew wash them.
During the week of Tisha B’av, undergarments should be bought rather than washed. Upper garments one should rather wash.
Towels: old towels should be reused. If the old towels are too dirty to use, and there are no alternatives, one may wash the towels.
Bed linens should not be changed on Shabbos Chazon unless they are too soiled to use.
Nails may be cut Erev Shabbos.","###question

 May I use water on Shabbos if the usage is being recorded by a digital meter?,"Digital water meters, which monitor and record water usage electronically, have become prevalent lately.

Although those who don’t use these meters out of the desire to honor the sanctity of Shabbos tavo aleihem brachah (should be commended), the consensus among contemporary poskim is that digital water meters are not an issue due to a combination of factors, among them:
It’s not considered a typical form of writing, and at the very worst would be forbidden only m’d’rabanan (rabbinically).
The writing is the result of a grama, a secondary result merely caused by the primary, intended act.
It’s also koach kocho, not something obviously attributable to the original act of opening the faucet, but rather the result of a convoluted process many steps removed from that initial deed.
It’s a davar sheino miskaven—there is no intention of performing the melachah (forbidden act) of kosev (writing). It’s not considered a pesik reisha (an act with an inevitable outcome) which is forbidden even when inadvertent, since—in many digital meters— each individual usage isn’t recorded, and the meter only registers when a certain level of usage is reached. Thus, there is no certainty that any particular usage will trigger a digital recording. This is called a safek pesik reisha (it is doubtful whether the outcome is inevitable), and since it’s only a d’rabanan, one may be lenient.
It’s lo nichah leh—the person using the water has no desire that their use of water be recorded electronically. (Although it could be argued that one might actually want the usage to be recorded if the alternative is paying a higher fee, it still doesn’t mean that there’s a desire that it be recorded in this particular, forbidden manner).","###question

 Is it true that Minhag Chabad is to refrain from eating meat even after making a Siyum during the 9 days?,"I have not heard of such a Minhag as an official Chabad Minhag.
In Sefer Haminhagim it relates:
כ”ק אדמו”ר (מהרש”ב) נ”ע הי’ נוהג לעשות סיומים בט’ ימים שבין ר”ח לט’ באב אף שלא היה סועד אח״כ בבשר ויין.
In the English translation:
The Rebbe Rashab used to time the festive conclusion of his study of various Talmudic tractates to coincide with the Nine Days from Rosh Chodesh Menachem Av until Tishah BeAv. The meal that honored each such Siyum, however, included neither wine nor meat.
It’s possible that people understood from the translation as to say that the Rebbe Rashab was makpid that although he made a siyum he nevertheless did not eat meat. However, the simple understanding of the Hebrew text doesn’t imply that. Rather he made a siyum even though he had no intention of eating meat.
Furthermore, there are numerous times the Rebbe quoted this custom and on (at least) one occasion explained the basis for the custom.
In שיחות קודש תש”מ ש”פ דברים סעי’ צג the Rebbe says that the Rebbe Rashab needed for health reasons to eat chicken once every few days (including at least once in the nine days) and in order to eat chicken, he made a siyum on all of the nine days. The Rebbe then goes on to ask if the Rebbe Rashab only needed to eat chicken one day why did he have to make a siyum every day? The Rebbe answers because he didn’t want to use the Torah as something to use for his own physical benefit. In other words, he didn’t want to make a siyum in order to eat chicken – even if needed for health reasons. This way since he made a siyum every day it’s not noticeable that it was so he can eat chicken on that one day.
Also interesting to note from תו”מ ש”פ פנחס תשמ”ה (page 2648) where the Rebbe mentions
ומכיון שעושים סיום מסכת – יכולים לעשות סעודת מצוה ולאכול בשר ולשתות יין. וכפי שכבר נהגו בכמה מקומות לעשות סיומים ולקשר זאת עם סעודת מצוה עד לאכילת בשר כו’.
Thus, there is no official minhag not to eat meat. At the same time, the purpose of the siyum is not in order to have meat. Nor was that the intention of the Rebbe’s horaah to make siyumim every day. Perhaps, that’s the reason why a custom developed not to serve meat at siyumim other than where necessary.
Additionally, when it comes to eating meat, there are certain restrictions as to what constitutes a siyum, and whether it’s permitted to schedule it deliberately for the nine days, as well as restrictions on who can attend a siyum with meat. For all these reasons, many are accustomed not to serve meat and such occasions.","###question 
  Is it true that Minhag Chabad is to refrain from eating meat even after making a Siyum during the 9 days?.
 ###answer 
 I have not heard of such a Minhag as an official Chabad Minhag.
In Sefer Haminhagim it relates:
כ”ק אדמו”ר (מהרש”ב) נ”ע הי’ נוהג לעשות סיומים בט’ ימים שבין ר”ח לט’ באב אף שלא היה סועד אח״כ בבשר ויין.
In the English translation:
The Rebbe Rashab used to time the festive conclusion of his study of various Talmudic tractates to coincide with the Nine Days from Rosh Chodesh Menachem Av until Tishah BeAv. The meal that honored each such Siyum, however, included neither wine nor meat.
It’s possible that people understood from the translation as to say that the Rebbe Rashab was makpid that although he made a siyum he nevertheless did not eat meat. However, the simple understanding of the Hebrew text doesn’t imply that. Rather he made a siyum even though he had no intention of eating meat.
Furthermore, there are numerous times the Rebbe quoted this custom and on (at least) one occasion explained the basis for the custom.
In שיחות קודש תש”מ ש”פ דברים סעי’ צג the Rebbe says that the Rebbe Rashab needed for health reasons to eat chicken once every few days (including at least once in the nine days) and in order to eat chicken, he made a siyum on all of the nine days.

" When is the optimal time to put on Rabbeinu Tam Tefillin in a non-Chabad Rosh Chodesh Minyan that doesn’t take a break after U’va Letziyon?
If I’m behind, or if the minyan does not put Rabbeinu Tam (ashkenaz) can I first daven musaf with the minyan and then put Rabbeinu Tam tefillin?","
Our custom is to put on Rabbeinu Tam tefillin before musaf. If the minyan does not wait, one should make every effort to be able put on the tefillin earlier in davening. One should be careful not to remove tefillin shel rosh in the presence of a sefer Torah; they should turn and face the other way or do it under the tallis.
There is also an important idea of having the Rebeinu Tam on as soon as possible when taking off the Rashi Tefillin so that the blessing that was said on Rashi will count for Rebeinu Tam Tefillin (see Shulchan Aruch Admor Hazaken 34:5).
Additionally, based on Kabalah from the Arizal it is not ideal to put on Rebeinu Tam after davening Mussaf, (see Kaf Hachayim Orach Chayim 25:94-96)  since there is a level of Kedushas Musaf and it is no longer the time for Tefillin.
Question:
Could I go ahead of the minyan by saying ashrei and u’va l’tzion in the breaks between aliyos during krias haTorah which would give me time to put Rabbeinu Tam tefillin while the congregation would be saying ashrei and uva letzion or it is better to say ashrey and u’va l’tzion with the minyan to miss davening musaf with the minyan?
Answer: 
It’s better to say ashrei earlier so as not to miss musaf with a minyan. However, you the davener may decide what is best for yourself, (to go ahead of the minyan or not) in this specific case.
In any event, if one takes off his Tefillin before the Sefer Torah is returned to the Ark, he should not do so in the presence of the Sefer Torah, but should turn aside. This is so not to dishonor the Sefer Torah. (See Shulchan Aruch Admur Hazaken Orach Chayim 25:42).","###question

" How can I enter my building on Shabbos if the door can only be opened with an electric key?
I need an electric key to enter the building I live in (attached is a picture of the key). On Shabbos, they try to put something in the door that it shouldn’t lock, sometimes though some גוים from the building take it out and it gets locked. The question therefore is:
1. Can one carry this key on their bendel on Shabbos?
2. Can one give the key on Shabbos to a goy passing by (and ask them) to open the door
Note, there is no other way to enter the building!","
The key is Muktzah given that its primary purpose cannot be used for Shabbos. It therefore cannot be touched with one’s hands. If it is the only key on the Bendel, you would not be able to put the Bendel on or take it off with your hands. However, you may attach the key to a Bendel which has other regular keys that are at least as significant, and the Bendel may then be put on and taken off, but without touching this actual key. [Although it would normally be ideal to remove Muktzah keys before Shabbos, this is not a requirement.]
Asking a Goy to open the door for you, would be permitted, being that it is a Psik Reisha. Also, it is a Shevus Dshevus in a case of reasonably great need.

 May I use money set aside for Maa’ser to buy treats for girls in high school?,"Background:

"Is it necessary to wait 6 hours after eating regular hard cheese like mozzarella, Munster, cheddar cheese, before eating fleishig?
As a general rule, Is Parmesan considered aged cheese nowadays hence rendering it a ‘6-hour cheese’?","
Mozzarella and Munster cheeses – are soft cheeses and they are aged on average for 30 days. There is no need to wait six hours after eating them.
Note that the above mentioned cheeses are produced differently in the U.S.A and in Europe resulting in different taste as well as texture.
Also note, that some are strict to wait six hours, also after regular cheeses, such as Mozzarella and Munster.
Cheddar – One should wait 6 hours after eating such a cheese.
Feta – One should wait 6 hours after eating such a cheese. See below.
Parmesan – One must wait six hours after cheese which has aged, even if melted. Parmesan cheese clearly meets the definition of hard cheese.
Note: Some Parmesan cheeses say on the packaging “Non-aged over 10 months”, the reason for this is because typical Parmesan cheeses are aged for a minimum of 10 months or more, so sometimes the company is only clarifying the matter but certainly the cheese was aged for various months (most probably 6 or more) and has the qualities required to be considered גבינה קשה a hard cheese.","###question

We are doing renovations on our home. As far as leaving an area untouched as a Zecher L’Churban; what is the bare minimum that must be done in this regard? Size? Location? Can it be covered over or decorated in any way?,"There is a halachah in Shulchan Aruch that there should be a zecher l’churban at every joyous occasion in one’s life.
One application of this halachah is that when one is building or renovating a house or apartment they should leave an unfinished area measuring an amah by an amah (approx. 1.5 ft x 1.5 ft) which can be seen right when one walks into the house; this area should not be newly plastered, painted, nor wallpapered.
There are some poskim who are lenient and say that the unplastered area may be covered, and others who say it may not. Some say that this should be done in every room of the house, but the consensus among poskim is that leaving an unfinished area near the entrance is sufficient.
If one buys a house or apartment from a non-Jew they need not do so—unless they are putting up new walls. Even if one buys from a Jew, but if the previous Jewish homeowner acquired it from a non-Jew, it does not need to be done either, since initially there was no obligation to do so. However, this is the case only if the residence was not gutted nor the walls replaced from the time that the first Jew bought it; this is one of the reasons many people are lenient regarding this halachah. However, if the Jewish owner is repainting the home or apartment they should leave an amah by an amah unpainted where it can be seen upon entering.","###question

 Am I allowed to eat in a married woman’s kitchen if she does not cover her hair?,"This depends on various factors. Firstly, do you know if she keeps the basic kosher standards that are not necessarily kept by all kosher consumers such as: Cholov Yisrael and Pas Yisrael, etc..? In other words, what is her official standards?
Is she knowledgeable and active in checking salads for bugs? Does she check eggs for blood spots? Does she understand that there are many hechsherim and not all of them are acceptable to Anash?
If it seems to you that her knowledge seems adequate to run a kosher kitchen to your liking, then we need to consider the second question: can you rely on her Yiras Shamayim due to the fact that she does not cover her hair?
This would depend on her upbringing. For example, if she is only starting to become frum the reason for not covering her hair might be because she knows that many Orthodox women do not cover their hair and she considers herself like one of them, (of course this is wrong, but it is her nisayon – challenge). If so, it could be acceptable to eat in her home if otherwise, her Yiras shamayim seems to be good in all other aspects.
If, however, she has had a frum upbringing and now does not cover her hair, then this is a negative reflection on her yiras shamayim. This is since there is no true justified reason she can have that she is not covering her hair.
Therefore, the matter would depend on your kosher standards and the specifics of some of the above-mentioned points to consider.","###question

 Yes, you should skip Tachanun, but in a manner that doesn’t call attention to your behavior.

" Is there an Inyan in Chabad to Lein for Bar Mitzva?

The Rebbe strongly discouraged Bar Mitzvah boys from spending their pre-Bar Mitzvah time practicing how to lein.

Even studying the ma’amar is secondary to this objective.
It should be noted that not all Bar Mitzvah boys are capable of studying an entire Maamar Baal Peh. Even if he studies a portion of the Maamar, and even if has to read from the text bifnim, this is still okay.

 Do stockings for women’s legwear need to be opaque?,"Questions:
1. Must a woman’s stockings be opaque (I.e. the leg isn’t seen through the stockings)?
2. Is it permissible to wear stockings which cover the leg completely (no holes), are somewhat sheer (can see the leg through hosiery) but are visibly not the woman’s leg (I.e. there is a seam or design, or the color is darker than the leg/black)
Answers:
The area below the knee is considered the Shok and thus is an Ervah and therefore must be covered. The denier of the stockings should be such that it is impossible to see the legs through the stockings. Yet, it need not conceal the shape of the leg. Some suggest the number 40 and others suggest higher numbers.
There are many women who are accustomed to wearing stockings of a lesser denier. While this goes against the straightforward understanding of the halacha, there is some room within halacha to defend those do so, as long as it blurs the image of the leg. Lechatchila one should be Machmir that the skin shouldn’t be visible at all, as above.","###question

"I’m due for a baby a couple days after Rosh Hashanah. I usually run late. If I go into labor on Yom Kippur what is allowed in regard to drinking/eating, showering, or anything else to ease that time?","A. Once active labor has begun you should drink regularly – not small amounts at a time (Shiurim) – to ensure you have enough fluid in your body. Discuss with your doctor whether eating is recommended.
Active labor is defined when contractions are regular and less than five minutes apart, you feel you cannot walk, ready to push, or the water has broken.
Showering is also permitted at this stage.
Q. Also, sometimes there is false labor, or labor-like contractions that might be brought from dehydration, or just nearing labor. It’s not always definite to know that labor has actually begun even with these. How do I go about it?
A. Discuss with the doctor how to determine whether it’s real labor or not.
Additionally, it’s important to ensure before the fast that you are fully hydrated.","###question

 Can I Toivel a dish that I buy as a gift for someone?,"The Halacha is that a dish has to be toiveled by the owner or when it’s being given as a gift, the recipient.
If that is not possible, either because they are not going to do it themselves or because they will not be able to do it themselves before Yom tov, you may tovel it on their behalf.
The procedure is as follows:
The giver first makes a kinyan (halachic transfer of ownership) by handing the gift to another person who acts as a shaliach (representative) of the recipient and lifts it up on their behalf. Once the kinyan has taken place, it is as if the gift belongs to the recipient, and the giver may toivel it on their behalf.

" Anxiety and Depression: Lack of Emunah or a Clinical Condition?
The following question, in itself, is not a Halachic question per se. However, the issue has very practical ramifications, and thus I am seeking guidance as to the proper approach to this issue.
תורה, in general, and the תניא קדישא in particular, talk at great length about anxiety and depression. תורה states that anxiety is a reflection of a lack of אמונה and בטחון in הקב”ה, because if one would truly believe that אין רע יורד מלמעלה, he would never be anxious about his future. Similarly, תורה states that depression is one of the gravest emotions that one can embrace, because when one is depressed, he is in essence indicating that he does not believe that whatever הקב”ה does for him is for his good.
These two concepts [i.e. the תורה approach to anxiety, and the תורה approach to depression] are fundamental elements of יהדות. However, anxiety and depression are unanimously regarded [under specific circumstances] as clinical conditions by the modern medical world. So assuming תורה acknowledges the conclusions of the modern medical world, and thus the תורה does consider the possibility that one’s anxiety and / or depression is not a reflection of a lack of אמונה and / or בטחון, rather, it is a clinical condition, how can one determine the status of his anxiety and / or depression?
In other words, how can one know if his anxiety and / or depression is a reflection of a lack of אמונה and / or בטחון, and thus it is incumbent on him to strengthen his אמונה and / or בטחון, or if his anxiety and / or depression is clinical, and thus it is incumbent on him to seek professional help?","

However, translating the Chumash into any other language, and especially learning Chumash with the commentary of Rashi—which is Torah She’be’al Peh (the Oral Torah)—is permissible at night. Ideally, however, studying Chumash in any manner should preferably be done in the daytime.
Tehillim, according to many opinions, is also included in the Arizal’s enjoinment against Mikra at night, and therefore shouldn’t be recited in the nighttime either. It is the custom that even reciting Tehillim in the form of a techinah and bakashah (supplication)—according to some opinions, even for someone who is unwell— as opposed to studying it, should also be avoided at night.
Many poskim rule that all of the above does not apply after chatzos (midnight), particularly with regard to Tehillim.

 Is an oven with Sabbath Mode truly acceptable for Shabbos use?,"There are many ovens on the market, and it is impossible in this short space to investigate and address every single model. The best we can do is provide a summary of the many issues to look out for. It is important that you read through the manuals of any model you are considering for purchase, in order to determine whether, and to what degree, the issues outlined below apply.
Modern ovens without “Sabbath Mode”:
First, let us focus on modern ovens which do not have a Sabbath Mode feature. Such ovens are challenging to use for Shabbos and Yom Tov, for a number of reasons. The main problem with using them on Shabbos is the thermostat, which is affected by opening or closing the oven. When the oven door is opened, the thermostat will detect the cold air that rushes in and will activate the heating element if it is off at that moment. It is forbidden to cause this to occur, even if all the food will be removed all at once before the oven door is re-closed. [If the oven door is re-closed with some of the food remaining inside, there may be additional concerns of Bishul on Shabbos, depending on the circumstances.]
The thermostat is not a concern for Yom Tov use, but the problem with using such an oven on Yom Tov is primarily a practical one; most modern ovens have an auto shut-off feature that turns the oven off after around 6-12 hours. Yet another problem, applicable on both Shabbos and Yom Tov, is that many models have lights or fans that are activated and deactivated as the door is opened or closed. In summary, a modern oven without Sabbath Mode may be completely unusable on Shabbos and Yom Tov.
Ovens with “Sabbath Mode”:
Buying an oven with Sabbath Mode will alleviate many of these problems. Sabbath Mode will generally disable the oven’s display panel and any electronic controls, as well as disengage the fans and lights from being activated by opening and closing the oven door. The Sabbath Mode feature will also disable the auto shut-off feature. However, one very big problem, at least with regards to most models, is that the thermostat usually remains operative. [Some ovens have a light which illuminates when the heating element is on, in which case the oven could theoretically be opened when the light is on. However, it has been demonstrated through rigorous testing that these indicator lights are generally inaccurate, and may be illuminated even when the heating element is off.]
The thermostat does not present a problem for Yom Tov use, but makes it completely forbidden on Shabbos, according to most opinions. The outcome is that, ironically, the Sabbath Mode oven remains forbidden for Shabbos use, and is permitted only on Yom Tov. Perhaps it would have been more apt to name this feature “Yom Tov Mode”.
There is a practical workaround for Shabbos use that is easy and simple: Estimate about what time the main course will be served, and make sure that the oven turns off before then. This is generally easy to achieve, as the Sabbath Mode feature can usually be set to turn the oven off in any increment amount of time up until 72 or 96 hours. So, you can easily set the oven to go off after 2 or 3 hours, for example. Once the oven is off, opening the door does not create a problem with regards to the thermostat.
However, this method will usually create a new problem, which requires its own workaround. Now that the oven is off, this means that Sabbath Mode is now deactivated as well, and opening the door will turn the light on (if the oven has a light). This can be circumvented before Shabbos by manipulating the magnets or levers that detect whether the door is open. The specific manner of circumvention will vary from model to model, and in the case of magnetic detectors, may take some trial-and-error. Some oven doors are designed to be taken apart to allow proper cleaning of all the glass panes, and the magnet can be physically removed from the door. In other models, it may work to place a strong and thin magnet on the oven wall at the correct place. (The location of the oven’s magnet can usually be detected by sliding a paperclip around the top of the oven door.) These options may or may not work, depending on the model, so you would have to try before Shabbos, when you have the time and patience to troubleshoot it. [Note: Disabling the magnetic sensor only helps with regards to the functions controlled by the door sensor, such as the oven light and fans. However, the thermostat is not controlled by the door sensor, which is why the oven needs to be off before opening the door on Shabbos.]
Following the advice above, when Shabbos is followed by Yom Tov, one would have to choose whether to reserve the oven’s use for Shabbos or Yom Tov, as using it on Shabbos would require the oven to be set to turn off on Shabbos, in which case it will remain off for the duration of Yom Tov as well.
The Issur of Shehiya with regards to an oven:
The above answer focuses purely on using the oven itself. However, there are also restrictions about which foods may be placed in an oven before Shabbos without a Blech, and much discussion about whether, and how, a Blech can be facilitated in an oven. Here is a brief summary of the issues:
From the Torah perspective, one may place food over an open flame before Shabbos in order that it cooks on Shabbos. Nevertheless, Chazal forbade this due to the concern that a person may come to stoke the fire on Shabbos in order to speed up the cooking process. This prohibition is known as Shehiya.
One method of avoiding Shehiya is to cover the flames, typically with a Blech. Covering the fire indicates that one does not desire a strong flame, it diverts his attention from the fire, and it serves as a reminder not to increase the flames. With regards to an oven, there is a dispute whether – and how – a Blech can be adequately created. In practice, a Blech in an oven should be situated so that it covers the heating elements, which may be located either at the top of the oven, the bottom or the back-wall. In many ovens, there are heating elements in all of these places.
Another way of addressing Shehiya, and to sidestep the need for a Blech, is to ensure that the food is cooked prior to Shabbos. It is sufficient if the food is already half cooked.  This fraction does not represent time, but rather, is qualitative and measured against the degree of cooking most people would regard as fully cooked. Nevertheless, for a number of reasons, it is best that the food be fully baked before Shabbos.
There is yet a third possible way to circumvent the prohibition of Shehiya. Chazal allowed one to put completely raw meat on an open flame just before the onset of Shabbos. They were not concerned that one might come to stoke the flames, because doing so would not serve any productive purpose – it would not ready the meat in time for the Friday night meal, nor would it be necessary to ready the meat in time for the Shabbos day meal. This leniency is known as “Kidra Chaysa” – literally: raw pot. (Indeed, some people may wish to put raw chicken and rice right before Shabbos to slow bake in the oven for the daytime Seudas Shabbos.)
In order for this leniency to apply, two criteria must be met. First, the food item must be one that takes a relatively long time to cook properly (such as meat). Second, the food must be put on the fire just before Shabbos, late enough that it will not begin cooking before Shabbos comes in. Some contemporary Poskim therefore assert that this leniency seldom applies nowadays, because most modern cooking appliances are able to cook in a relatively short amount of time. As a case in point, meat put up to cook right at the onset of Shabbos would usually be fit for consumption by the time the meat course  arrives. Even if the heat is set to low, this does not diminish the oven’s overall ability to bake quickly, because the seat heating can be easily raised. Thus, according to these Poskim, this option is not applicable to a modern oven.
Other associated issues:
1. It should be pointed out that even when the oven is off and cold, if it will be turned on with a Shabbos clock or a timer (see next point), one may not place inside any food which is not completely cooked. Furthermore, even completely cooked food that has cooled down may not be placed inside either, unless the food is completely dry (and will remain dry when heated). The same applies to an oven which will remain off but has  not yet cooled down.
2. With regards to Shabbos clocks in general, the Rebbe writes in a letter (Igros Kodesh Vol 12 page 192): “There are those who are extremely stringent and are even skeptical about the permissibility of using a Shabbos clock… Therefore, I am abstaining from giving this idea in an official capacity.” Even so, it is reported that the Rebbe instructed some individuals that they may be used (See Shulchan Menachem Volume 2 page 173). At the same time, many authorities who permit Shabbos clocks in general nevertheless rule that they should not be used with regards to cooking specifically, for a number of reasons.

The custom is to have a curtain always covering the Aron Kodesh’s door. This is not only to beautify the Aron Kodesh but a sign of modesty. This is based on the verse (Terumah 26:33) “… The partition shall separate for you between the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies.” An additional reason is that the curtains are a cover over the aron, as was done in the midbar that the Klei Hakodesh (holy vessels) were covered.

It seems that if there is no other set Paroches, a Tallis is to be placed on the outside of the Aron Kodesh.

The Rebbe writes that not having a paroches on the outside is a change of minhag yisroel. Igros kodesh 10: 83. Ibid. p. 152.
It seems that if there is no other set Paroches, a Tallis is to be placed on the outside of the Aron Kodesh. The Zereh Emes clearly writes that even if the curtain is not as nice as the Aron Kodesh, one still should cover it from the outside. However, this should only be temporary, for one should make an effort to place a set and beautiful Paroches."

There is no Kashrus concern regarding mixture of milk and meat. It is however preferable to clean the wire between milk and meat, if food usually gets stuck there when eating.

"I have been following a candidate diet which helps rid the body yeast. This is due to years of suffering from symptoms that I’ve only just identified as likely yeast overgrowth in my body. On the diet you’re not allowed to have any sugar (or anything that your body converts to sugar) or any yeast. My question is about Kiddush and hamoitzi on shabbos. I don’t want to have wine and challah being that any bit of sugar or yeast can feed the yeast in my body, causing them to getting again before they can die off and set the diet back to start. Therefore I want to know if I can I skip the wine and challah on shabbos until I’ve rid myself off the yeast problem?","
Firstly, it is important to differentiate between if this is a question which touches ספק סכנה (slightest chance of mortal danger) or חולה שאין בו סכנה (illness that temporarily incapacitates). If this is touches the first category, you are certainly exempt from having Challah and wine on Shabbos.
If this is touching only the second category or מיחוש (minor discomfort) then the following applies:
Wine:
Practically speaking, it would be best to have someone else recite Kiddush and you will listen and you do not need to drink the wine (Shulchan Aruch Admor Hazaken Orach Chayim 272:12).
Challah:
Eating Challah at kiddush is an obligation for Kiddush on wine needs to be in place of a Seudah. The main Seudah is considered Lechem (bread). The bread needs to be of the type one would recite המוציא and ברכת המזון on it. (Shulchan Aruch Admor Hazaken Orach Chayim 274:5).
If it is very difficult, one can suffice with eating only one Kazayis of bread. (Shulchan Aruch Admor Hazaken Orach Chayim 274:6.) In this case, no bracha is made when washing.
There is the view of the הגהת מהרי”ל בסימן קפח (the Alter Rebbe’s brother) who testified that the Alter Rebbe in the end of his life changed his earlier ruling and said that one fulfills the obligation of “Seudah” for Shabbos also with Mezonos.
If the above is also too hard to do, you may rely on the following:
Hear kiddush from someone else and drink reviis wine for mokom seuda. If that’s not possible either – eat something filling in following priority order (dates, meat or fish). You may rely on the opinion that holds that mokom seuda of the one making kiddush is sufficient in addition to the opinion that holds that anything filling is considered mokom seuda.
For lechem mishnah: hear from someone else lechem mishnah and eat yourself a tiny piece. For less than a Kazayis, one does not bentch. (Shulchan Aruch Admor Hazaken Chayim 184:2).
You may rely on those that say lechem Mishnah is on one family member as well as the opinion that holds that less than kezayis is enough. In addition you will be filling yourself with other foods as mentioned before.","###question

But still, since I’m afraid I’m not able to concentrate and keep saying it over and over, could I just say it once and no matter if I had proper concentration or not move on?","Response:
I am sorry to hear about your condition and I’m sure that you are seeking medical help, and I’m glad to offer halachic help.
Someone who suffers from an ailment, physical or mental, must do all they can to be healed, at times even at the expense of violating a positive Mitzva. The Rebbe is of the opinion (as are mental health professionals lehavdil), that part of the treatment for OCD is to never repeat anything, and that this has priority over your obligation of Mitzvos. In simple words: to repeat any part of a Mitzva, even it’s kavana, is detrimental to your mental health and should not be done. This would be the halacha even if it would mean not fulfilling a Mitzva. But as I’ll explain soon, you did in fact fulfill your Mitzva obligation.
Regarding kavana specifically – I think the solution that you have (to verbalize your kavana) is a great one! Halacha states that if one has an initial intention to fulfill a Mitzva during its preparation, that intention is effective even hours later when he actually does the Mitzva, even though he does not have specific intention at the moment. How much more so when you are having the intention right before fulfilling the Mitzva. The effectiveness is strengthened when the intention is verbalized. For then it is effective even if someone might have opposite thoughts!
From the above it is clear that once you have kavana to fulfill the Mitzva, and especially if you verbalize it, there is nothing to be worried about. And neither the kavana nor the verbalization should be repeated.

 Can an electric cooktop be used on Yom Tov?,"
On Shabbos, we are forbidden from raising/lowering a fire. Chazal said that one must cover the fire – and according to some poskim, the knobs too – in case one might forget and raise the fire over Shabbos.
On Yom Tov however we are permitted to raise a (real, not electric) fire, but we may not extinguish it or lower it, and therefore this halacha does not apply for Yom Tov. However, it is still forbidden to actually raise/lower an electric appliance.
Therefore you may use an electric appliance without worry about the knobs/buttons, just make sure not to actually use the knobs/buttons.","###question

" I do not live so close to a shule. The only nearby shule uses a “Shabbos” microphone. Is there a halachic problem with such a microphone on Shabbos?
AskTheRav:
There are details missing here. What type of shul is this that uses a “Shabbos microphone”?
What are their mechitzah standards and other religious standards?
User:
Thank you for your reply:
The shule is Orthodox, as is the rabbi. Many (if not almost all) are not yet Shomrei Shabbos.
The mechitzah is 40”.
The microphone is tzomet.
The rabbi is willing to let us make a separate minyan in our own room.
So the question is:
Could I join the main minyan, based on the microphone/mechitza?
Could we use the facility to make a separate minyan?","
The accepted normative standard for a mechitzah is that it be at least 6 feet (72″) tall. This is the mainstream accepted halacha as well as the standards instructed by the Rebbe.
The same applies with regard to using a microphone on Shabbos. Virtually all poskim have forbidden this, whether due to halachic concerns of Chilul Shabbos (havarah, boneh, makeh b’patish, klei shir, etc.), or the halacha of avsha milsa (in contrast to chiming clocks which are set usually in advance and therefore permitted, mics are not normally set in advance and create an issue of avsha milsa).
Others mention that one cannot be yotze Kedusha or chazaras hashatz this way. Moreover, even during the week, it is a major issue as it an imitation of the Reform. Even though the microphone has a practical purpose to be able to gear the Chazan, we find that Poskim forbade moving the Mechitza to the front, for this very reason, even when done for practical convenience. Indeed, Poskim such as the Chasam Sofer and others have forbidden bringing a musical organ into the shule for this reason). Even if the “Shabbos microphone” would be “halachically kosher”, it could lead to other breaches in halacha, as we see that there is a great פירצה in this matter of “modernization in Synagogues”. Most Gedolei Gisroel have not accepted the heter of a “Shabbos microphone” even with all the special conditions. See at length והרים הכהן ד, יא. 
It is however permissible to daven in a side room in the Synagogue (in a fully kosher fashion) provided that it is clear that this minyan is a separate entity from the big minyan and that it will not be associated with the “quasi orthodox minyan”, and it should not be interpreted as giving a “hechsher” to the big minyan. ראה שו״ת אג״מ או״ח ב, מ. Since is likely that if you are short of a minyan, some of the daveners will go into the big minyan which is not up to par, it would be better to pray somewhere else until things improve in the Halachik standards of the shul. However, there is room to be lenient in a side room as outlined above.","###question

"I know the minhag of many is Not to make kiddush between six and seven. This was what I remember my custom in my parents home. My question is, sometime this leads to stress in the house either rushing through Sholom Aleichim to get on time and rushing from shul home. On the other hand we have a house of young children at home and waiting till seven can lead to chaos some times. Kids are impatient and hungry. In addition we have guests and this can add pressure. Is there room to be maikel on this custom?","
Although this minhag is brought in the Alter Rebbe’s Shulchan Aruch (271:3), it is a minhag and not a Din. Chazal teach us that great is peace, for the whole Torah was given only to make peace in the world. Accordingly, the mitzva of sholom overrides this minhag. Furthermore, we find that Shalom Bayis outweighs the entire mitzvah of kiddush, for, according to halacha, if one cannot afford both Shabbos candles and wine for kiddush, he should buy only candles since they are there for the purpose of Shalom Bayis.
At the same time, It is highly recommended that one do their best to explain to family members that this is our minhag and the significance of observing minhagim, especially a minhag mentioned in Poskim. In fact, some consider this an issue of potential sakanah which is often deemed more serious than matters of issur. Generally speaking, observing Torah customs bring about more peace and stability in the home and shouldn’t cause conflict. The conflict usually stems from an inadequate presentation and packaging of the issue. If the family perceives the significance of this issue, they would fully appreciate your behavior.
Obviously, if despite all attempts to present things in the proper manner it still appears to cause stress or tension, or if it affects the atmosphere in the house (,), then one definitely should not wait.
When Kiddush is made within the hour wait time it should be made immediately upon arrival home from shul, with as least delay as possible.
Alternatively one may make kiddush before going to shul, even before dark. Although this is not the usual Lubavitch minhag, it is preferable than making Kiddush during the hour.
Guests – the Rebbe writes that this minhag applies even in the event of guests, since it is a sakana issue. However it is still restricted to what I wrote above.
Children – children do not need to wait for kiddush to eat, not even for chinuch. Most likely the situation can be ameliorated somewhat if they are given something to eat until kiddush is made. In fact, if they are hungry one is not allowed to stop them from eating.","###question

" A home, with a full Kosher kitchen, had Goyim working there as home attendants during a span of several years. Do all the dishes need to be Kasherd?
A home had goyim and not observant yidden working there as home attendants (one at a time) throughout the day and night during a span of several years.
In this home, there was a kosher kitchen with multiple cabinets and closets of many pots, pans, utensils, etc. In addition to the workers’ being instructed not to touch any dishes, throughout the years of this situation, there were always family members coming in and out at random hours of day and night checking up (although there may have been some shifts/days during which no family members came, but they were never informed if/when family would show up). Sometimes residing extremely close by.
In more recent times, there were also cameras installed. Despite that, there were several times (not many) which certain workers (of which there were various, different years brought different ones, but only one at a time) were caught using a utensil or about to use one. It remains unknown if there many other such instances in which they weren’t caught. Though it would have possibly been noticed if a utensil was left out.
Please note that they weren’t authorized to cook and so there was no cooking taking place. There was a kettle which they used to make hot drinks for the kosher patient and perhaps for their own food. But they weren’t usually seen eating hot food, so I’d assume they mostly dealt with cold. There are hundreds of utensils in this kitchen (not any unusual quantity, but a typical accumulation of a classic kosher kitchen). It is extremely unlikely that the vast majority of them were ever used by these workers.
The question now is the status of everything in the kitchen (the situation is no longer ongoing). Are the dishes all batul berov? Also, some of the cabinets/drawers looked like they were never handled though we can never know with certainty. The point being, if there was contact, some areas were more likely to have been accessed than others – if that’s a factor. Do they still need kashering? There are sets of china (and other utensils of non-kasherable material) as well.
Please advise your opinion on the matter. Sources would be appreciated. Thanks a lot!","

" Does Ma’aser need to be given on cash rewards/miles/points earned through your credit card?
The only way you can earn them is through spending money, is it considered earned money?","
Miles:
If you can only use the points for very specific items you need not give maaser. However, if it gives you a broad purchasing power through your credit card it’s considered as a monetary gift and maaser must be given.
If it can only be used as miles (and the miles are not being exchanged for cash) or to reduce your credit card debt, maaser need not be given.
Ma’aser need not be separated from miles earned on a flight even if exchanged for cash, as it’s considered a rebate on the ticket.
Cashback:
One need not separate maaser from rebates, even if they are cash back rebates.
Points:
There are those who wish to make a distinction between various types of credit card points as follows: Credit card points received for purchases, whether per dollar or after reaching a certain threshold (say, $1000 within a specific time frame) would, in their opinion, be considered similar to a rebate. However, points that are received for referrals or sign-up bonuses for new accounts (if they’re not attached to spending a specific amount within a specified time frame) are deemed as income. Though it’s hard to justify this line of reasoning -see Hebrew references below- there is room to allow those who follow this opinion to continue doing so.","###question

 Is it permissible to go paintball shooting?,"It is important to point out that if this is regarding a camp activity, then whatever written further below has no bearing on what should be done in camp. The purpose of this answer is not for staff members – in contrast to the director – to take this answer and make a Balagan in camp with it. The camp has their Rav who they ask their Shailos to, and that is what is to be followed in the camp B’Poel Mamosh. 
According to Halacha, one should not hit oneself nor shall he hit anyone else even if he gives permission, for it is not his body to give permission to hurt (and an Issur D’Oraysa might be involved).
Some Rabbonim permit paintball shooting as a school or camp activity to encourage learning and/or proper behavior (i.e. as a trip for for good learning) – similar to the concept of hitting a child to help his learning.
Others argue that it is only Assur to hurt someone if done in a harmful manner, however, since paintball shooting is done in a friendly manner there is no Issur involved. Nonetheless, this Heter should only be used if it is L’Toieles.
Indeed, tackle football is regularly played in many otherwise religious schools and camps. However, there is an obvious distinction since here there are guns used for shooting and hurting, while tackling is not officially to attack.
While these arguments might justify the Minhag to be lenient, there is strong room to adopt a stringent approach, as per the straightforward reading of Halacha (referenced below).

" On which side of the Mechitzah does a transgender man sit?
On which side of the Mechitzah does a transgender man (i.e., someone who was born a woman but identifies herself as a man) sit?","
While there are different opinions among the Achronim about the status of a person who R”L goes through a transgender surgery, the consensus is that the individual retains their original status.
Regarding where to sit, she should sit in the women’s section dressed as a woman. Even if she doesn’t appear completely like a woman, it would be acceptable to sit there in this case.
On the other hand, sitting in the men’s section is Halachically problematic. Theoretically, since in such a case it wouldn’t cause Hirhurim to have her sitting at the men’s side, and it wouldn’t be a violation of Yichud, it could be acceptable – in theory – to do so. Nonetheless, there is a Maris Ayin issue.
Another equally important point is what people in the Shul will say if they know that there is a transgender man/woman sitting on their side of the Mechitza? Will a man or woman there be turned off from praying in the Shul? Likewise, will it somehow weaken the position of Halacha in this matter? Having a woman Daven in the men’s section is a public statement that while Hashem instructed one way, the individual is publicly choosing to act otherwise, and is publicly acting as a man in defiance of the way Hashem created them.
The Rebbe writes that synagogue issues depend on many details, including those who pray in the Shul and the way they will perceive it.
Therefore, with following the axiom of Chazal: “Always the right hand should draw closer and the left hand …”, it be advisable to explain to the person the problem  of them attending Shul services.
The options are to Daven in the women’s section dressed as a woman, or in the hallway.","###question

While there are different opinions among the Achronim about the status of a person who R”L goes through a transgender surgery, the consensus is that the individual retains their original status.
Regarding where to sit, she should sit in the women’s section dressed as a woman. Even if she doesn’t appear completely like a woman, it would be acceptable to sit there in this case.
On the other hand, sitting in the men’s section is Halachically problematic. Theoretically, since in such a case it wouldn’t cause Hirhurim to have her sitting at the men’s side, and it wouldn’t be a violation of Yichud, it could be acceptable – in theory – to do so. Nonetheless, there is a Maris Ayin issue.
Another equally important point is what people in the Shul will say if they know that there is a transgender man/woman sitting on their side of the Mechitza? Will a man or woman there be turned off from praying in the Shul? Likewise, will it somehow weaken the position of Halacha in this matter? Having a woman Daven in the men’s section is a public statement that while Hashem instructed one way, the individual is publicly choosing to act otherwise, and is publicly acting as a man in defiance of the way Hashem created them.
The Rebbe writes that synagogue issues depend on many details, including those who pray in the Shul and the way they will perceive it.
Therefore, with following the axiom of Chazal: “Always the right hand should draw closer and the left hand …”, it be advisable to explain to the person the problem  of them attending Shul services.
The options are to Daven in the women’s section dressed as a woman, or in the hallway."
