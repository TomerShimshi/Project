        \ to this general question:\nOne must follow what the rabbonim say even if\
        \ they are in error, as this is the desire of Hashem. In other words: while\
        \ their arguments might not be true, the halacha follows their position even\
        \ if it\u2019s not true.\nAn alternative approach is that a person must consider\
        \ the fact that Hashem will certainly protect the rabbonim and ensure that\
        \ they don\u2019t make any mistakes.\nOf course, one should always take into\
        \ account that it is very likely that they\u2019re not in error to begin with,\
        \ and the only reason one thinks they are mistaken is because one does not\
        \ have accurate information or is not that advanced in one\u2019s Torah knowledge.\n\
        As for the examples you mentioned, vaccines and shul closures, without getting\
        \ into the specific details of those matters: while in your opinion they might\
        \ have been in the wrong, it could very well be that the rabbonim possess\
        \ all the information that you have, but are aware of many other details and\
        \ facts which you\u2019re not aware of which impacted their decision. Indeed,\
        \ many people maintain that those decisions have actually saved many lives.\
        \ As mentioned, once they reached this decision, their position should be\
        \ followed regardless.\nThe example you gave about the ex-communication of\
        \ the Chasidim in Vilna is very different. The halacha is that when Beis Din\
        \ judges an individual or a group, they may not accept testimony about their\
        \ behavior without allowing the individual to hear the testimony and be given\
        \ a chance to challenge it. Furthermore, once they have heard incriminating\
        \ evidence without the individual being present at the time, they may no longer\
        \ rule on this case. Any dispute which involves a plaintiff and defendant\
        \ may only be ruled on if both parties are present and are allowed to present\
        \ their position in front of the court. If this process has not been followed\
        \ the ruling is meaningless and void.\nThis is in contrast to general halachic\
        \ rulings which involve determining correct or incorrect behavior, where one\
        \ must obviously follow the position of Torah sages and rabbonim, even if\
        \ one tends to disagree.\nThe\_fundamental difference here is: this\_applies\

            \ Rabonim do make mistakes with Siyata Dishmaya?\nA very recent example\
