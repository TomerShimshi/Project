" May I put a frozen bag of vegetables etc. on my body on Shabbos as it might melt from my body heat?
If the answer is yes, may I cool myself off with these packets of frozen milk knowing and benefiting from the fact that they will melt? If neither of these are acceptable,may I use a cold cloth placed in the freezer?","
1) One may handle ice packs to cool off with, since only a small amount of water is melted, there is no intention of melting them and the melted water is going to waste. Melting ice is problematic when one actively melts it, or even when no action is taken if this his intention, for example if wants to melt it save the melted water – which is not applicable in this case.
However, frozen food items like meat and vegetables should not be used since they are muktzah.
2) Since you want to melt the milk, you should not purposely use it to cool off so as to proactively melt it.
3) Cold towels that are not wet and will not become squeezed is permissible to use.","###question

" Can I get a heter to be intimate with my husband during the day?
Hi, I am nine months pregnant and too tired most of the time to be intimate at night. Can I get a heter to be intimate with my husband during the day?","
According to halacha, relations must be at night or even after break of dawn until it’s light enough where people can recognize each other (misheyakir), the time when one may put on tefillin, provided it’s dark. This affects also the mazal as well as the neshama of the child born from these relations.
Ideally, you should attempt to do the same, but where this proves very difficult, and particularly in your case of pregnancy where it’s not for the purpose of conception, there is room for leniency. However, you should ensure that the room is completely dark, or at least cover yourself completely with a blanket that no light enters. If possible, one should schedule relations for Shabbos day.","###question

 Does one need to ask a Rav before being induced? Is there any Halachic issue?,"
This matter is discussed in a number of Poskim. The general rule is that one may not induce or rush the onset of labor unless there are clear medical reasons to require it. Some of the reasons for this prohibition are because:
There is a level of risk inherent to childbirth, and one should therefore not hasten it even though it is bound to come.
The special assurance of protection Hashem provides at the time of childbirth does not necessarily apply to the same degree if the birth is hastened without a clear medical need.
The procedures and/or medicines involved in induction can themselves cause complications, and one should not take that risk needlessly.","###question

Our son was born on 19 Iyar. This year Erev Shavuos is on Shabbos. When should we make the Upshernish – on Friday 4 of Sivan or Tuesday Isru Chag?,"
• Generally:
For a child whose birthday is from after Lag Baomer until Erev Shavuos, the Upshernish haircut should take place on Erev Shavuos. [When Erev Shavuos falls on Shabbos – on 4 Sivan (with the exception of someone whose birthday is on Erev Shavuos, in which case it should be postponed until after Shavuos)].

• However, regarding someone whose birthday is on 19 Iyar, a day after Lag Baomer:
There are instructions from the Rebbe to perform the haircut on Lag Baomer.
While in most places it appears that it should take place on Lag Baomer itself (during the day), a day before the child turns 3, others record that it should be done on the actual birthday, right after nightfall on the night after Lag Baomer.
See here the testimony of three people who were all instructed by the Rebbe to do it on Lag Baomer: R. SB Popak, R. YY Hecht and R. Refoel Hartman. In the case of R. Hecht, the Rebbe himself did the cutting. (This information has been independently verified by us). In the case of R. Hartman, we have the actual answer of the Rebbe.
Independent of the above, there is yet another directive presented regarding the Upshernish of Ari Halberstam hy”d (whose birthday is on 19 Iyar), of which there are pictures of the Rebbe cutting the hair. See in the Hebrew references below.

 Is an oven with Cook-time or Stop-time Mode acceptable for Shabbos use?,"There are many ovens on the market, and it is impossible in this short space to investigate and address every single model. The best we can do is provide a summary of the many issues to look out for. It is important that you read through the manuals of any model you are considering for purchase, in order to determine whether, and to what degree, the issues outlined below apply.
Thermostat:
The main problem with using a oven on Shabbos is the thermostat, which is affected by opening or closing the oven while the oven is on. When the oven door is opened, the thermostat will detect the cold air that rushes in and will activate the heating element if it is off at that moment. It is forbidden to cause this to occur, even if all the food will be removed all at once before the oven door is re-closed. [If the oven door is re-closed with some of the food remaining inside, there may be additional concerns of Bishul on Shabbos, depending on the circumstances.]  The thermostat is not a concern for Yom Tov use, but there are additional problems with a oven on Yom Tov as detailed below.
If the oven is off, like after the cook-time or stop time has finished this would not be an issue.
the problem with using such an oven on Yom Tov is primarily a practical one; most modern ovens have an auto shut-off feature that turns the oven off after around 6-12 hours. Yet another problem, applicable on both Shabbos and Yom Tov, is that many models have lights or fans that are activated and deactivated as the door is opened or closed. In summary, a modern oven without Sabbath Mode may be completely unusable on Shabbos and Yom Tov.
Ovens with “Sabbath Mode”:
Buying an oven with Sabbath Mode will alleviate many of these problems. Sabbath Mode will generally disable the oven’s display panel and any electronic controls, as well as disengage the fans and lights from being activated by opening and closing the oven door. The Sabbath Mode feature will also disable the auto shut-off feature. However, one very big problem, at least with regards to most models, is that the thermostat usually remains operative. [Some ovens have a light which illuminates when the heating element is on, in which case the oven could theoretically be opened when the light is on. However, it has been demonstrated through rigorous testing that these indicator lights are generally inaccurate, and may be illuminated even when the heating element is off.]
The thermostat does not present a problem for Yom Tov use, but makes it completely forbidden on Shabbos, according to most opinions. The outcome is that, ironically, the Sabbath Mode oven remains forbidden for Shabbos use, and is permitted only on Yom Tov. Perhaps it would have been more apt to name this feature “Yom Tov Mode”.
There is a practical workaround for Shabbos use that is easy and simple: Estimate about what time the main course will be served, and make sure that the oven turns off before then. This is generally easy to achieve, as the Sabbath Mode feature can usually be set to turn the oven off in any increment amount of time up until 72 or 96 hours. So, you can easily set the oven to go off after 2 or 3 hours, for example. Once the oven is off, opening the door does not create a problem with regards to the thermostat.
However, this method will usually create a new problem, which requires its own workaround. Now that the oven is off, this means that Sabbath Mode is now deactivated as well, and opening the door will turn the light on (if the oven has a light). This can be circumvented before Shabbos by manipulating the magnets or levers that detect whether the door is open. The specific manner of circumvention will vary from model to model, and in the case of magnetic detectors, may take some trial-and-error. Some oven doors are designed to be taken apart to allow proper cleaning of all the glass panes, and the magnet can be physically removed from the door. In other models, it may work to place a strong and thin magnet on the oven wall at the correct place.(The location of the oven’s magnet can usually be detected by sliding a paperclip around the top of the oven door.) These options may or may not work, depending on the model, so you would have to try before Shabbos, when you have the time and patience to troubleshoot it. [Note: Disabling the magnetic sensor only helps with regards to the functions controlled by the door sensor, such as the oven light and fans. However, the thermostat is not controlled by the door sensor, which is why the oven needs to be off before opening the door on Shabbos.]
Following the advice above, when Shabbos is followed by Yom Tov, one would have to choose whether to reserve the oven’s use for Shabbos or Yom Tov, as using it on Shabbos would require the oven to be set to turn off on Shabbos, in which case it will remain off for the duration of Yom Tov as well.
The Issur of Sheiyah with regards to an oven:
The above answer focuses purely on using the oven itself. However, there are also restrictions about which foods may be placed in an oven before Shabbos without a Blech, and much discussion about whether, and how, a Blech can be facilitated in an oven. Here is a brief summary of the issues:
From the Torah perspective, one may place food over an open flame before Shabbos in order that it cooks on Shabbos. Nevertheless, Chazal forbade this due to the concern that a person may come to stoke the fire on Shabbos in order to speed up the cooking process. This prohibition is knownas Shehiya.
One method of avoiding Shehiya is to cover the flames, typically with a Blech. Covering the fire indicates that one does not desire a strong flame, it diverts his attention from the fire, and it serves as a reminder not to increase the flames. With regards to an oven, there is a dispute whether – and how – a Blech can be adequately created. In practice, a Blech in an oven should be situated so that it covers the heating elements, which may be located either at the top of the oven, the bottom or the backwall. In many ovens, there are heating elements in all of these places.
Another way of addressing Shehiya, and to sidestep the need for a Blech, is to ensure that the food is cooked prior to Shabbos. It is sufficient if the food is already half cooked.  This fraction does not represent time, but rather, is qualitative and measured against the degree of cooking most people would regard as fully cooked. Nevertheless, for a number of reasons, it is best that the food be fully baked before Shabbos.
There is yet a third possible way to circumvent the prohibition of Shehiya. Chazal allowed one to put completely raw meat on an open flame just before the onset of Shabbos. They were not concerned that one might come to stoke the flames, because doing so would not serve any productive purpose – it would not ready the meat in time for the Friday night meal, nor would it be necessary to ready the meat in time for the Shabbos day meal. This leniency is known as “Kidra Chaysa” – literally: raw pot. (Indeed, some people may wish to put raw chicken and rice right before Shabbos to slow bake in the oven for the daytime Seudas Shabbos.)
In order for this leniency to apply, two criteria must be met. First, the food item must be one that takes a relatively long time to cook properly (such as meat). Second, the food must be put on the fire just before Shabbos, late enough that it will not begin cooking before Shabbos comes in. Some contemporary Poskim therefore assert that this leniency seldom applies nowadays, because most modern cooking appliances are able to cook in a relatively short amount of time. As a case in point, meat put up to cook rightat the  onset of Shabbos would usually be fit for consumption by the time the meat course  arrives. Even if the heat is set to low, this does not diminish the oven’s overall ability to bake quickly, because the seat heating can be easily raised. Thus, according to these Poskim, this option is not applicable to a modern oven.
Other associated issues:
1. It should be pointed out that even when the oven is off and cold, if it will be turned on with a Shabbos clock or a timer (see next point), one may not place inside any food which is not completely cooked. Furthermore, even completely cooked food that has cooled down may not be placed inside either, unless the food is completely dry (and will remain dry when heated). The same applies to an oven which will remain off but has  not yet cooled down.
2. With regards to Shabbos clocks in general, the Rebbe writes in a letter (Igros Kodesh Vol 12 page 192): “There are those who are extremely stringent and are even sceptical about the permissibility of using a Shabbos clock… Therefore, I am abstaining from giving this idea in an official capacity.” Even so, it is reported that the Rebbe instructed some individuals that they may be used (See Shulchan Menachem Volume 2 page 173).  At the same time, many authorities who permit Shabbos clocks in general nevertheless rule that they should not be used with regards to cooking specifically, for a number of reasons.

This is generally easy to achieve, as the Sabbath Mode feature can usually be set to turn the oven off in any increment amount of time up until 72 or 96 hours. So, you can easily set the oven to go off after 2 or 3 hours, for example. Once the oven is off, opening the door does not create a problem with regards to the thermostat.
However, this method will usually create a new problem, which requires its own workaround. Now that the oven is off, this means that Sabbath Mode is now deactivated as well, and opening the door will turn the light on (if the oven has a light). This can be circumvented before Shabbos by manipulating the magnets or levers that detect whether the door is open. The specific manner of circumvention will vary from model to model, and in the case of magnetic detectors, may take some trial-and-error. Some oven doors are designed to be taken apart to allow proper cleaning of all the glass panes, and the magnet can be physically removed from the door. In other models, it may work to place a strong and thin magnet on the oven wall at the correct place.(The location of the oven’s magnet can usually be detected by sliding a paperclip around the top of the oven door.) These options may or may not work, depending on the model, so you would have to try before Shabbos, when you have the time and patience to troubleshoot it. [Note: Disabling the magnetic sensor only helps with regards to the functions controlled by the door sensor, such as the oven light and fans. However, the thermostat is not controlled by the door sensor, which is why the oven needs to be off before opening the door on Shabbos.]
Following the advice above, when Shabbos is followed by Yom Tov, one would have to choose whether to reserve the oven’s use for Shabbos or Yom Tov, as using it on Shabbos would require the oven to be set to turn off on Shabbos, in which case it will remain off for the duration of Yom Tov as well.
The Issur of Sheiyah with regards to an oven:
The above answer focuses purely on using the oven itself. However, there are also restrictions about which foods may be placed in an oven before Shabbos without a Blech, and much discussion about whether, and how, a Blech can be facilitated in an oven. Here is a brief summary of the issues:
From the Torah perspective, one may place food over an open flame before Shabbos in order that it cooks on Shabbos. Nevertheless, Chazal forbade this due to the concern that a person may come to stoke the fire on Shabbos in order to speed up the cooking process. This prohibition is knownas Shehiya.
One method of avoiding Shehiya is to cover the flames, typically with a Blech. Covering the fire indicates that one does not desire a strong flame, it diverts his attention from the fire, and it serves as a reminder not to increase the flames. With regards to an oven, there is a dispute whether – and how – a Blech can be adequately created. In practice, a Blech in an oven should be situated so that it covers the heating elements, which may be located either at the top of the oven, the bottom or the backwall. In many ovens, there are heating elements in all of these places.
Another way of addressing Shehiya, and to sidestep the need for a Blech, is to ensure that the food is cooked prior to Shabbos. It is sufficient if the food is already half cooked.  This fraction does not represent time, but rather, is qualitative and measured against the degree of cooking most people would regard as fully cooked. Nevertheless, for a number of reasons, it is best that the food be fully baked before Shabbos.
There is yet a third possible way to circumvent the prohibition of Shehiya. Chazal allowed one to put completely raw meat on an open flame just before the onset of Shabbos. They were not concerned that one might come to stoke the flames, because doing so would not serve any productive purpose – it would not ready the meat in time for the Friday night meal, nor would it be necessary to ready the meat in time for the Shabbos day meal. This leniency is known as “Kidra Chaysa” – literally: raw pot. (Indeed, some people may wish to put raw chicken and rice right before Shabbos to slow bake in the oven for the daytime Seudas Shabbos.)
In order for this leniency to apply, two criteria must be met. First, the food item must be one that takes a relatively long time to cook properly (such as meat). Second, the food must be put on the fire just before Shabbos, late enough that it will not begin cooking before Shabbos comes in. Some contemporary Poskim therefore assert that this leniency seldom applies nowadays, because most modern cooking appliances are able to cook in a relatively short amount of time. As a case in point, meat put up to cook rightat the  onset of Shabbos would usually be fit for consumption by the time the meat course  arrives. Even if the heat is set to low, this does not diminish the oven’s overall ability to bake quickly, because the seat heating can be easily raised. Thus, according to these Poskim, this option is not applicable to a modern oven.
Other associated issues:
1. It should be pointed out that even when the oven is off and cold, if it will be turned on with a Shabbos clock or a timer (see next point), one may not place inside any food which is not completely cooked. Furthermore, even completely cooked food that has cooled down may not be placed inside either, unless the food is completely dry (and will remain dry when heated). The same applies to an oven which will remain off but has  not yet cooled down.
2. With regards to Shabbos clocks in general, the Rebbe writes in a letter (Igros Kodesh Vol 12 page 192): “There are those who are extremely stringent and are even sceptical about the permissibility of using a Shabbos clock… Therefore, I am abstaining from giving this idea in an official capacity.” Even so, it is reported that the Rebbe instructed some individuals that they may be used (See Shulchan Menachem Volume 2 page 173).  At the same time, many authorities who permit Shabbos clocks in general nevertheless rule that they should not be used with regards to cooking specifically, for a number of reasons.

 Am I allowed to eat in a married woman’s kitchen if she does not cover her hair?,"This depends on various factors. Firstly, do you know if she keeps the basic kosher standards that are not necessarily kept by all kosher consumers such as: Cholov Yisrael and Pas Yisrael, etc..?

If so, it could be acceptable to eat in her home if otherwise, her Yiras shamayim seems to be good in all other aspects.
If, however, she has had a frum upbringing and now does not cover her hair, then this is a negative reflection on her yiras shamayim. This is since there is no true justified reason she can have that she is not covering her hair.

" What is the minimum of Challah one can eat and still be able to wash & Bentch?
I try to keep the minhag of melave malka every week, including washing. Sometimes it’s hard to eat a lot after having eaten recently at the Shabbos meal…
What is the minimum of challah/Matzah one can eat and still be able to wash/bentch?
Over the years I’ve seen many different places where there is a weight amount or, worse yet, a description such as “kazayis” or “kabeitza” to describe food shiurim, and those leave a person very confused as to the exact amount of food. Would the Rav be so kind as to describe the size of a piece of challah or the amount of matzah (usually box Square Matzah)? (E.g. The amount of challah comparable to a golf ball or two golf balls etc or a different item that the challah could be measured against).
Additionally, does the shiur consist of only the hamotzi food, or could something that’s put on top of the challah/matzah also count as part of the shiur? (Let’s say if someone puts egg salad or tuna salad on challah, can this be counted and this way one eats let’s of the actual hamotzi food but can nevertheless still wash and bench).
And finally, is there a time frame in which one needs to eat the shiur?","
One must wash (without a Bracha) and make Hamotzi for even the smallest amount.
One must wash with a Bracha if he’s planning on eating a K’beitza. This is approximately 2 K’zeizim. Each K’zayis should be eaten within K’dei Achilas Pras (= 4 minutes) and without pausing between the two of them.
One must make a Birchas Hamazon if he ate a K’zayis of bread within 4 minutes. Other foods do not count for this amount.
If 4 minutes proves to be too difficult, one can be lenient and eat it within 6 minutes but should eat approximately the size of 1/3 of a K’beitza within 4 minutes. If one is not sure if it was eaten in the right amount of time – if he is satiated, he should still make a Birchas Hamazon.
Torah measurements are usually volume-based, not weight. A K’zayis is the approximate volume of half an average size egg. A K’beizah is the volume of an average size egg. Nonetheless, for simplicity, they have been converted to weight measurements, although the weight measurements are far from accurate. This is because different foods with an equal volume weigh differently. The following is the weight for water; bread and certainly matzah weighs less. For a K’beitza this is approx. 53.8 gram or 1.89 oz. For a K’zayis, approx. 25.6 gram or 0.90 oz.
One-third of a standard square machine matza is approximately a K’zayis. With bread, it is harder to measure, as they are not uniform but it is approximately the size of what would fit into a small l’chaim cup. In order to be safe, one should err on the side of caution and eat slightly more than the shiur, due to a number of reasons, among them since some crumbs remain between the teeth.

This matter is discussed in a number of Poskim. The general rule is that one may not induce or rush the onset of labor unless there are clear medical reasons to require it. Some of the reasons for this prohibition are because:
There is a level of risk inherent to childbirth, and one should therefore not hasten it even though it is bound to come.
The special assurance of protection Hashem provides at the time of childbirth does not necessarily apply to the same degree if the birth is hastened without a clear medical need.
The procedures and/or medicines involved in induction can themselves cause complications, and one should not take that risk needlessly.","###question

There is a level of risk inherent to childbirth, and one should therefore not hasten it even though it is bound to come.
The special assurance of protection Hashem provides at the time of childbirth does not necessarily apply to the same degree if the birth is hastened without a clear medical need.
The procedures and/or medicines involved in induction can themselves cause complications, and one should not take that risk needlessly."

Thank you for contacting AskTheRav. We have received your question.
Please note that AskTheRav receives many questions from our visitors every day. We strive to answer these matters of practical Halacha in an efficient manner. Therefore, we ask our visitors to limit their questions to those of practical Halachic nature rather than learning style research questions, so that we can spend our time serving you best with your Halachic questions.
Regarding your question: The Chabad position re Zionism is very nuanced. An excellent summary can be found here, and here.
Regarding the usage of Ivrit, see here 
Regarding taking control of the mountain, Jews have complete control over that area. As for an obligation to build the Beis Hamikdosh on Temple Mount, this is actually one thing where the Rebbe was very clear on this matter.

The takana to learn chitas is on an individual basis, where everyone will finish the Chumash and Tanya throughout the year. And the Tehillim on a monthly basis.
Splitting up the chitas is not the ideal method, since you as an individual will not have completed the above. There is however some merit in it, since you, as part of a group, will have it completed (similar to the division of Shas has done on 19 Kislev, although as noted, this was not the original takana of chitas).

Nails shouldn’t be cut on Wednesday night – like Thursday.
Regarding nights in general –
May I cut my hair and nails after chatzos (midday)?
Sifrei Kabbalah (Holy writings of Kabbalah) relate that the Arizal would refrain from having his hair cut after midday. Some are of the opinion that the same would apply to cutting nails. The question is: what was the reason for this custom?
If it was because we shouldn’t engage in any new melachah (work) once the zman (time) of Mincha has arrived—lest we be distracted from davening Mincha—then we can assume that there is no issue with cutting our hair after having davened Mincha. Nails, however, may be cut even before davening Mincha.
However, if the reason was that according to Kabbalah the forces of dinim (Heavenly judgment) begin gaining strength after midday, it would be cause to refrain from doing so throughout the entire afternoon, and in fact more so at night, when the dinim are even more severe. Although the influence of the forces of dinim is mentioned specifically only regarding haircuts, it can arguably be applied to nail cutting too.
Common practice, though, is that we do take haircuts and cut our nails after midday—provided that we have davened Mincha—and at night as well. Likewise, If one has a fixed minyan for davening Mincha, one need not refrain from engaging in melacha prior to davening.","###question

 Do apricots or honey need a Hechsher?,"Honey:
Raw unflavored honey which is 100% pure and filtered may be used without a Hechsher. However, retail size honey often goes through heating which can be a problem when using shared equipment. It is therefore recommended to purchase honey only with a Hechsher. One must ensure that no other ingredients are added like alcohol and sweeteners. Additionally, the honey needs to be filtered very well from any pieces of the bees that can get mixed in it.
Apricots:
Fresh apricots do not require a Hechsher unless they are from Eretz Yisroel. Even dried apricots, if produced out of Eretz Yisroel (usually they are made in Turkey), do not require a Hechsher, provided they are unflavored, and without additives, since no other ingredients go in the drying process. Sulfur dioxide added is not a concern. However, some apricot companies season their apricots with flavoring to give their apricots a unique taste. Therefore, to be on the safer side it is best to buy only with a Hechsher as food processing is always changing. One must certainly ensure the apricots are insect free. They must be checked appropriately.","###question

" Am I allowed to use the sunroof of a car with Schach on it as a Sukkah when out on a family trip on Chol Hamoed Sukkos?
SimilarQuestion:
Can one make a sukkah by removing T tops and placing a mat on top, into a kosher albeit, temporary sukkah? Both sides of the roof would be off, but there is a .5 foot separation running down the middle.","
A few introductions:
A Sukkah has to:
be (and have walls that are) at least 32 inches tall and have width of at least 22.4 inches by 22.4 inches;
have at least 3 walls;
be a place where you are comfortable to eat, drink, spend time and sleep.
In this case:
A. the Schach would have to be covering a (uninterrupted) space that is 32″ tall and 22.4″ by 22.4″ (the seats would be considered an interruption);
B. the car (which is being used as walls) cannot be more than 9.48″ off the ground and the sides have to be directly under the Schach, and have above height;
C. you would have to be comfortable to eat sleep and spend time there.
See also here:
Can we connect a U-Haul trailer to the back of a car and have a Sukkah there. Can we go into that on Shabbos or Yom Tov?
In conclusion, unless you meet all the above requirements, it cannot be done.
See also the following excerpts from our Day to Day Halachic Guide:
MOBILE SUKKAH
A person who is traveling without access to a Sukkah, can create a Sukkah out of a vehicle (or two), as follows:
LOCATION
The spot you choose should be semi-secluded, and not on a public path where it would interfere with foot traffic. It should also be a safe, crime-free area, where you would technically be able to sleep at night. It should also fulfill the other requirements for the positioning of a Sukkah – the area above the s’chach free of tree limbs or overhangs
ASSEMBLY
Use the front and back door of a single vehicle (on the same side) or open a single door on mirroring sides of two vehicles. (The interior of a convertible or roadster that fits all the dimensions below can be used as well.)
The area created by the three sides (either the two doors and the one car body, or the two car bodies and the adjacent doors) has to be at least seven tefachim long and seven tefachim wide (about 22.5 inches on each side).
The doors must reach ten tefachim (3.25 feet) in height and start no more than three tefachim (9.5 inches) off the ground. Parking near a curb and opening the door(s) over the curb will help in this regard.
The doors must be fully and firmly open, so that a gust of wind will not slam them closed.
ROOF
It is preferable not to prop the s’chach directly on the car doors, but to first place wood laths or the like across and the s’chach on top of that. The s’chach should be fixed to the “roof” with jute twine or string (not zip ties) so that it will not blow away.
The above is set up in such a way that the “walls” of the Sukkah are adjacently perpendicular to the s’chach. If there is an area of four amos (six feet) of car roof on any side of the Sukkah or four tefachim (13 inches) of car roof or other unkosher covering in the middle of the Sukkah, it is unusable.115 If the mobile Sukkah is of the smallest possible size (seven by seven tefachim), any three-tefach span of car roof – whether in the middle or on the side – will invalidate it.
USE
You must hold your food or put it down on a table or surface inside your makeshift Sukkah. You may not eat under the s’chach and use the seat in the car (outside your Sukkah) as your table.
You must stipulate that the vehicle(s) will be able to be used for (non-holy) purposes after the Sukkah is dismantled, since, as stated above, we are usually not allowed to use the parts of a Sukkah for another purpose once they were used for a mitzvah.","###question 
  Am I allowed to use the sunroof of a car with Schach on it as a Sukkah when out on a family trip on Chol Hamoed Sukkos?
SimilarQuestion:
Can one make a sukkah by removing T tops and placing a mat on top, into a kosher albeit, temporary sukkah? Both sides of the roof would be off, but there is a .5 foot separation running down the middle..
 ###answer 
 
A few introductions:
A Sukkah has to:
be (and have walls that are) at least 32 inches tall and have width of at least 22.4 inches by 22.4 inches;
have at least 3 walls;
be a place where you are comfortable to eat, drink, spend time and sleep.
In this case:
A. the Schach would have to be covering a (uninterrupted) space that is 32″ tall and 22.4″ by 22.4″ (the seats would be considered an interruption);
B. the car (which is being used as walls) cannot be more than 9.48″ off the ground and the sides have to be directly under the Schach, and have above height;
C. you would have to be comfortable to eat sleep and spend time there.

Can we connect a U-Haul trailer to the back of a car and have a Sukkah there. Can we go into that on Shabbos or Yom Tov?
In conclusion, unless you meet all the above requirements, it cannot be done.
See also the following excerpts from our Day to Day Halachic Guide:
MOBILE SUKKAH
A person who is traveling without access to a Sukkah, can create a Sukkah out of a vehicle (or two), as follows:
LOCATION
The spot you choose should be semi-secluded, and not on a public path where it would interfere with foot traffic. It should also be a safe, crime-free area, where you would technically be able to sleep at night. It should also fulfill the other requirements for the positioning of a Sukkah – the area above the s’chach free of tree limbs or overhangs
ASSEMBLY
Use the front and back door of a single vehicle (on the same side) or open a single door on mirroring sides of two vehicles. (The interior of a convertible or roadster that fits all the dimensions below can be used as well.)
The area created by the three sides (either the two doors and the one car body, or the two car bodies and the adjacent doors) has to be at least seven tefachim long and seven tefachim wide (about 22.5 inches on each side).
The doors must reach ten tefachim (3.25 feet) in height and start no more than three tefachim (9.5 inches) off the ground. Parking near a curb and opening the door(s) over the curb will help in this regard.
The doors must be fully and firmly open, so that a gust of wind will not slam them closed.
ROOF
It is preferable not to prop the s’chach directly on the car doors, but to first place wood laths or the like across and the s’chach on top of that. The s’chach should be fixed to the “roof” with jute twine or string (not zip ties) so that it will not blow away.
The above is set up in such a way that the “walls” of the Sukkah are adjacently perpendicular to the s’chach. If there is an area of four amos (six feet) of car roof on any side of the Sukkah or four tefachim (13 inches) of car roof or other unkosher covering in the middle of the Sukkah, it is unusable.115 If the mobile Sukkah is of the smallest possible size (seven by seven tefachim), any three-tefach span of car roof – whether in the middle or on the side – will invalidate it.

"Is there an exception to that “rule”, like when auspicious days fall out on Shabbos? (i.e. are we supposed to go ahead and ask anyway?)","
According to Halacha one may not request their needs on Shabbos.
One of the reasons for this is because Shabbos accomplishes everything by itself without the need for us to resort to asking for it.  Even when Rosh Hashana or Yom Kippur – which are the most auspicious days of the year to request all of our needs – fall out on Shabbos we do not request our needs with Avinu Malkeinu.
You can make all your requests after Shabbos ends, especially regarding Yud Tes kislev which we celebrate the 20th of kislev as well.
Additionally, anything which is part of the standard text of davening is permitted. Thus, you may have your requests in mind in the Davening of Shabbos, especially during the sections of davening which we say on Shabbos for personal needs (which are permitted being that they are part of the Nussch which the Chachomim instituted) like Yehi Rotzon in the morning Berochos, the middle Beracha of Shabbos Shemone Esrei, Eloki Netzor at the end of Shemone Esrei, Brich Shmei when the Aron Hakodesh is opened and Yekum Purkan and Mi Shebeirach before Musaf. It is important that we have extra kavana when reciting these tefillos. This is more preferred over any personal prayers.
As well, requests for a Refuah Shleima of critically sick person or spiritual requests are permitted on Shabbos. However we do not confess our sins on Shabbos.
We must use out these auspicious days especially when they fall out on Shabbos for extra Davening, learning, Farbrengen and undertaking good resolutions.","###question

"Q1. For heartburn/acid reflux, may one chew Tums with letters on Shabbos? If not, what should one do?","A. Swallowing pills with letters isn’t a problem. The issue is eating where it breaks before swallowing.

The definition of Keli B’toch Keli is that at least one Keli isn’t designed specifically for this holy item.

• However, regarding someone whose birthday is on 19 Iyar, a day after Lag Baomer:
There are instructions from the Rebbe to perform the haircut on Lag Baomer.
While in most places it appears that it should take place on Lag Baomer itself (during the day), a day before the child turns 3, others record that it should be done on the actual birthday, right after nightfall on the night after Lag Baomer.
See here the testimony of three people who were all instructed by the Rebbe to do it on Lag Baomer: R. SB Popak, R. YY Hecht and R. Refoel Hartman. In the case of R. Hecht, the Rebbe himself did the cutting. (This information has been independently verified by us). In the case of R. Hartman, we have the actual answer of the Rebbe.
Independent of the above, there is yet another directive presented regarding the Upshernish of Ari Halberstam hy”d (whose birthday is on 19 Iyar), of which there are pictures of the Rebbe cutting the hair. See in the Hebrew references below.

There is such a custom that on Friday night the host leads the zimmun. Otherwise, he may honor the guest. This custom applies even when a kohen is present.
Explanation:
Although there is a mitzvah to honor the guests, this only applied in the past when only one individual bentched and he exempted the others. Nowadays, when everyone bentches themselves there is no such mitzvah. Even in those days, if the host wished to lead the bentching himself and not honor the host, at any time, he may do so.
A kohen takes precedence only if he is equal in Torah standing to the others. Otherwise, the Talmid Chochom precedes him. Additionally, all this applies where all attendees are hosts or all are guests (and the host isn’t joining).","###question

 Are we careful about leaving water overnight? Do we need to invert pans after cleaning?,There are two issues:,"###question 
  Are we careful about leaving water overnight? Do we need to invert pans after cleaning?.
 ###answer 
 There are two issues:"
The problem is that we need to move there already this time next year since we are not able to afford to pay rent and mortgage at the same time and we cant start building until September. Any way around this?,"
All of this applies only if there was no building whatsoever in the entire area, even a small building.
If there was indeed no building, including a structure for the construction crew, the rule is as follows:
Regarding the area of the Shul, it is not an issue.
For the residential areas, if it’s for a home for a teacher or any other communal worker, it is not an issue. There’s also room for leniency if being bought by a young couple right after marriage.
If they’re being rented out and the owner is not the one living there, it’s not an issue either.
If the owner himself is living on the property, he should build a sukkah there first and afterwards it’s not a problem. Also, a proper Chanukas Habayis should be done to consecrate the home for Torah and Davening.
Another option is to make an independent “sale” of the home to someone else for the first year, and then one may live there immediately thereafter. (Alternatively, if you already own it prior to it being finished, you can sell it right then and there, and only when it’s complete will you re-purchase it).
Regardless, you should receive approval of three Rabbonim to go ahead with either of these leniencies.
The 12 months wait does not begin when the entire building was completed; it begins from when the building was above the height of the windows.","###question

My brother works in a store in Crown Heights and found a stroller that was left behind already for three days.

You have the obligation to publicize that you found this stroller in a way that the owner would find out about it (WhatsApp groups would not suffice under normal circumstances as not everyone has WhatsApp).
After a couple of days go by after you would assume that the owner found out where they lost it or who they can contact to receive their stroller back, you may:
1) Write down:
▪ Any Simanim that there is on the stroller;
▪ The time and place it was found.
2) Three people should evaluate the price and write it down.
From then on one can use the item for oneself.
If or when – with the coming of Moshiach, certainly the matter will be resolved – the owner should show up and give you the accurate details of the lost object, you are obligated to give them the amount it was worth at the time of the loss.","###question

 Does a garment that is 100% wool need to be checked for Shatnez?,"Yes.
According to American federal law, garments must have a label which lists the exact content of the fabric. However, this refers only to the material of the main shell fabric of the garment, but not to any threads or materials in the linings, backings, reinforcements, ornaments, padding, loops, fillings and other internal components. Thus, a label which states that the garment is 100% wool can contain as much as 2% of other materials and thus be shatnez.
Furthermore, the government is extremely lax in enforcing these laws. There isn’t also much concern for potential liability resulting from adverse reactions to the fabric, as fabric allergies are uncommon and usually not that serious. Many clothing manufacturers and distributors don’t bother therefore to identify accurately which fibers they use. They are may even deliberately misrepresent the information in order to boost their sales, since they know that they don’t much to fear from law enforcement agencies or other potential liabilities.
This is true even in places where such laws are in place. Many garments are manufactured in labor-cheap, third-world countries where mislabeling is common practice.","###question

It is forbidden to answer “Thank G-d”. As it is considered saying Shem Shomayim l’vatalah.
Adding the word A-mighty doesn’t make it acceptable either; rather, it’s considered saying two names of Hashem l’vatalah. Some suggest saying “Thank the L-rd”, but not everybody considers this an acceptable option either. As for the Rebbe saying often “May G-d A-mighty bless you”, see below in the references.
There are many alternatives and you may choose whatever you are most comfortable with. For example, “Thank the One above”; “Thank G, O, D” (pronouncing the actual letters), or “Thank Him” (pointing upwards). You can choose any variation of the above, or other original ideas.
You should however not try to avoid thanking Him by using secular alternatives, such as “Thank Goodness”, as there is a Mitzvah to thank Hashem for everything.
May I add that the fact that it might sound bizarre shouldn’t be a concern; on the contrary, it is an opportunity to be Mekadesh Shem Shomayim and explain where possible and relevant your behavior, in order to show reverence to G-d, and in line with Halacha, Jewish law. Society nowadays respects people who live up to their values; bizarreness often provides an added dimension of intrigue leading to more respect and even awe.
As to your comment about Ama D’bar (the common custom of society at large) saying it, this is unfortunately true.

The Rebbe once mentioned that the custom of Chassidim is to “Chap Arein” (difficult to translate, especially in this context; perhaps, rush into it or seize the opportunity) and recite the Bracha silently."

 Is it OK to go to the Ohel at night?,"Question:
Is it OK to go to the Ohel at night?
How about not eating; I can’t eat all day, or it’s OK not to eat just from Shkiah?
Answer
The common custom is not to go to a Beis Hakvaros at night. While many have written extensively on this topic, proving that there’s no issue whatsoever with going at night, we find in the writings of the Minchas Elazar that one is supposed to go to Davka by day.
Nonetheless, there is no halachic prohibition to go at night. Indeed, many people do go at night, especially when going to Kivrei Tzadikm. When going at night, one shouldn’t say Chapters of Tehilim.
It is noteworthy, however, that although the Rebbe would frequent the Ohel on a constant basis, as far as we know he never went at night, though many times the visit extended long into the night.
The custom is to drink but not eat before visiting the Ohel.
There is no clear source which discusses this custom vis-a-vis going at night. Some say one may eat straight until sunset. Nonetheless many have the custom not to eat from the morning. At the same time, one should certainly not go on a full stomach. If going immediately after sunset, it makes sense to stop eating a while before that.","###question

 Are all watches permissible to be worn on Shabbos? Are they Muktzeh?,"Watches are not Muktzah unless you need to press a button to see the time.
Non-working watch: According to many opinions, if the watch is not working it is Muktzah.
Electrical: Even if the watch contains a computer inside it is not Muktzah, since its main purpose is to display the time. If you know that you are likely to press the button and use the computer, you should not wear it on Shabbos. Likewise, if it has a button to produce light and you might out of habit press it at night, you should put a sticker or something to remind you not to do so on Shabbos. Some put their watch on the other hand to help them remember not to do so on Shabbos.
Room temperature: A watch that displays the room temperature may not be worn, since this watch works only due to the movements of the one wearing the watch. If it measures the temperature but does not display it unless a button is pressed, it may be worn.
Glow in the dark: If a light turns on when you go into a dark room then it is a problem; if it just glows in the dark then it is okay.
Self-winding: Some watches are powered through movement. Although many are lenient, it is best for one not to wear a self-winding watch on Shabbos, because whenever you move your hand it causes the watch to recharge, especially or once you removed it from your hand and want to put it back. Many Poskim agree that it should not be worn on Shabbos once it stopped or if it is not sufficiently recharged to last throughout Shabbos.
Solar-powered: The same applies to a solar-powered watch which will recharge when entering a place which it well lit.
 Kinetic Watch: A kinetic watch operates slightly differently, where instead of a battery, one’s movement generates the needed. This is more severe and should certainly not be worn on Shabbos, especially with kinetic watches with digital displays. All the more so, with an Eco-Drive watch which enters slow down mode when there is no light and returns to normal function (digital displays, correct second hand time, etc.) when exposed to light.
Apple watches or Fitbits are forbidden on Shabbos. Your movements activate the functions and the display, it tracks all your steps, monitors your heartbeat and so much more.
If Shabbos started and you forgot to remove your apple watch, you should take it off right away, preferably by undoing the buckle and dropping it off your hand. One cannot move freely until it’s removed.
Many Chassidim do not wear a watch at all on Shabbos or Yom Tov.

Also, is there an inyan to daven for the amud if I am not saying kaddish?.
 ###answer 
 
The general custom is that a parent says. There’s an advantage of davening for the amud even when not saying kaddeishim. Davening for the amud is even more important than kaddish.

 Why do some people not drink red wine between 6 and 7 on friday?,"White wine: There is a custom not to make kiddush on Friday nights between 6 and 7. The original sources make no mention of red wine specifically; likewise, the explanations provided for the custom do not link it with the color of wine either. The accepted interpretation is that this applies to all types of wine, and according to many – even if one makes kiddush on bread.
The reason for this custom: the Gemara tells us that the hours of the day are associated with the seven Mazalos, constellations or planets – Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, each one operating hour of the day in a rotating system; these celestial forces have influence on this world during their corresponding hour. During this hour of 6-7, the constellation of Tzedek (and its corresponding angel Tzadkiel) ceases to be dominant and the constellation of Maadim takes over. Maadim (and its corresponding angel, Samael, pronounced usually as “the Samach Mem”, the source of evil who rules over this Mazal), -the mazal identified with the Esav (Edom), Amalek and Haman- is associated with negative influences and is said to be the cause of destruction, plagues, murder, sickness, and punishment, among other such causes. The Gemara tells us that those born during the hour of Maadim have a tendency towards becoming a Shochet or Mohel, a profession involving bloodshed.
Thus, it’s recommended to avoid acceptance of Shabbos through kiddush in the times when Maadim dominates, so as not to add spiritual energy to Maadim. The reason for the partcular caution when making kiddush because Chazal tell us that two angels accompany people on their way back home from shule on Friday night—a good angel and an evil angel. If the house has been prepared (the candle lit, the table set etc.), the good angel gives a blessing that the next Shabbos will be the same, and the evil angel is forced to respond Amen. I f the house is not prepared for Shabbos, the evil angel wishes that the next Shabbos will be the same, and the good angel is forced to respond Amen. These two angels correspond to the Mazalos of Tzedek, Jupiter, and Maadim, Mars. Thus, at this time it’s important not to allow the negative angel dominion over us.","###question

 Is an oven with Cook-time or Stop-time Mode acceptable for Shabbos use?,"There are many ovens on the market, and it is impossible in this short space to investigate and address every single model. The best we can do is provide a summary of the many issues to look out for. It is important that you read through the manuals of any model you are considering for purchase, in order to determine whether, and to what degree, the issues outlined below apply.
Thermostat:
The main problem with using a oven on Shabbos is the thermostat, which is affected by opening or closing the oven while the oven is on. When the oven door is opened, the thermostat will detect the cold air that rushes in and will activate the heating element if it is off at that moment. It is forbidden to cause this to occur, even if all the food will be removed all at once before the oven door is re-closed. [If the oven door is re-closed with some of the food remaining inside, there may be additional concerns of Bishul on Shabbos, depending on the circumstances.]  The thermostat is not a concern for Yom Tov use, but there are additional problems with a oven on Yom Tov as detailed below.
If the oven is off, like after the cook-time or stop time has finished this would not be an issue.
the problem with using such an oven on Yom Tov is primarily a practical one; most modern ovens have an auto shut-off feature that turns the oven off after around 6-12 hours. Yet another problem, applicable on both Shabbos and Yom Tov, is that many models have lights or fans that are activated and deactivated as the door is opened or closed. In summary, a modern oven without Sabbath Mode may be completely unusable on Shabbos and Yom Tov.
Ovens with “Sabbath Mode”:
Buying an oven with Sabbath Mode will alleviate many of these problems. Sabbath Mode will generally disable the oven’s display panel and any electronic controls, as well as disengage the fans and lights from being activated by opening and closing the oven door. The Sabbath Mode feature will also disable the auto shut-off feature. However, one very big problem, at least with regards to most models, is that the thermostat usually remains operative. [Some ovens have a light which illuminates when the heating element is on, in which case the oven could theoretically be opened when the light is on. However, it has been demonstrated through rigorous testing that these indicator lights are generally inaccurate, and may be illuminated even when the heating element is off.]
The thermostat does not present a problem for Yom Tov use, but makes it completely forbidden on Shabbos, according to most opinions. The outcome is that, ironically, the Sabbath Mode oven remains forbidden for Shabbos use, and is permitted only on Yom Tov. Perhaps it would have been more apt to name this feature “Yom Tov Mode”.
There is a practical workaround for Shabbos use that is easy and simple: Estimate about what time the main course will be served, and make sure that the oven turns off before then. This is generally easy to achieve, as the Sabbath Mode feature can usually be set to turn the oven off in any increment amount of time up until 72 or 96 hours. So, you can easily set the oven to go off after 2 or 3 hours, for example. Once the oven is off, opening the door does not create a problem with regards to the thermostat.
However, this method will usually create a new problem, which requires its own workaround. Now that the oven is off, this means that Sabbath Mode is now deactivated as well, and opening the door will turn the light on (if the oven has a light). This can be circumvented before Shabbos by manipulating the magnets or levers that detect whether the door is open. The specific manner of circumvention will vary from model to model, and in the case of magnetic detectors, may take some trial-and-error. Some oven doors are designed to be taken apart to allow proper cleaning of all the glass panes, and the magnet can be physically removed from the door. In other models, it may work to place a strong and thin magnet on the oven wall at the correct place.(The location of the oven’s magnet can usually be detected by sliding a paperclip around the top of the oven door.) These options may or may not work, depending on the model, so you would have to try before Shabbos, when you have the time and patience to troubleshoot it. [Note: Disabling the magnetic sensor only helps with regards to the functions controlled by the door sensor, such as the oven light and fans. However, the thermostat is not controlled by the door sensor, which is why the oven needs to be off before opening the door on Shabbos.]
Following the advice above, when Shabbos is followed by Yom Tov, one would have to choose whether to reserve the oven’s use for Shabbos or Yom Tov, as using it on Shabbos would require the oven to be set to turn off on Shabbos, in which case it will remain off for the duration of Yom Tov as well.
The Issur of Sheiyah with regards to an oven:
The above answer focuses purely on using the oven itself. However, there are also restrictions about which foods may be placed in an oven before Shabbos without a Blech, and much discussion about whether, and how, a Blech can be facilitated in an oven. Here is a brief summary of the issues:
From the Torah perspective, one may place food over an open flame before Shabbos in order that it cooks on Shabbos. Nevertheless, Chazal forbade this due to the concern that a person may come to stoke the fire on Shabbos in order to speed up the cooking process. This prohibition is knownas Shehiya.
One method of avoiding Shehiya is to cover the flames, typically with a Blech. Covering the fire indicates that one does not desire a strong flame, it diverts his attention from the fire, and it serves as a reminder not to increase the flames. With regards to an oven, there is a dispute whether – and how – a Blech can be adequately created. In practice, a Blech in an oven should be situated so that it covers the heating elements, which may be located either at the top of the oven, the bottom or the backwall. In many ovens, there are heating elements in all of these places.
Another way of addressing Shehiya, and to sidestep the need for a Blech, is to ensure that the food is cooked prior to Shabbos. It is sufficient if the food is already half cooked.  This fraction does not represent time, but rather, is qualitative and measured against the degree of cooking most people would regard as fully cooked. Nevertheless, for a number of reasons, it is best that the food be fully baked before Shabbos.
There is yet a third possible way to circumvent the prohibition of Shehiya. Chazal allowed one to put completely raw meat on an open flame just before the onset of Shabbos. They were not concerned that one might come to stoke the flames, because doing so would not serve any productive purpose – it would not ready the meat in time for the Friday night meal, nor would it be necessary to ready the meat in time for the Shabbos day meal. This leniency is known as “Kidra Chaysa” – literally: raw pot. (Indeed, some people may wish to put raw chicken and rice right before Shabbos to slow bake in the oven for the daytime Seudas Shabbos.)
In order for this leniency to apply, two criteria must be met. First, the food item must be one that takes a relatively long time to cook properly (such as meat). Second, the food must be put on the fire just before Shabbos, late enough that it will not begin cooking before Shabbos comes in. Some contemporary Poskim therefore assert that this leniency seldom applies nowadays, because most modern cooking appliances are able to cook in a relatively short amount of time. As a case in point, meat put up to cook rightat the  onset of Shabbos would usually be fit for consumption by the time the meat course  arrives. Even if the heat is set to low, this does not diminish the oven’s overall ability to bake quickly, because the seat heating can be easily raised. Thus, according to these Poskim, this option is not applicable to a modern oven.
Other associated issues:
1. It should be pointed out that even when the oven is off and cold, if it will be turned on with a Shabbos clock or a timer (see next point), one may not place inside any food which is not completely cooked. Furthermore, even completely cooked food that has cooled down may not be placed inside either, unless the food is completely dry (and will remain dry when heated). The same applies to an oven which will remain off but has  not yet cooled down.
2. With regards to Shabbos clocks in general, the Rebbe writes in a letter (Igros Kodesh Vol 12 page 192): “There are those who are extremely stringent and are even sceptical about the permissibility of using a Shabbos clock… Therefore, I am abstaining from giving this idea in an official capacity.” Even so, it is reported that the Rebbe instructed some individuals that they may be used (See Shulchan Menachem Volume 2 page 173).  At the same time, many authorities who permit Shabbos clocks in general nevertheless rule that they should not be used with regards to cooking specifically, for a number of reasons.
For further discussion of these issues, including sources, please see the following links:","###question 
  Is an oven with Cook-time or Stop-time Mode acceptable for Shabbos use?.
 ###answer 
 There are many ovens on the market, and it is impossible in this short space to investigate and address every single model. The best we can do is provide a summary of the many issues to look out for. It is important that you read through the manuals of any model you are considering for purchase, in order to determine whether, and to what degree, the issues outlined below apply.
Thermostat:
The main problem with using a oven on Shabbos is the thermostat, which is affected by opening or closing the oven while the oven is on. When the oven door is opened, the thermostat will detect the cold air that rushes in and will activate the heating element if it is off at that moment. It is forbidden to cause this to occur, even if all the food will be removed all at once before the oven door is re-closed. [If the oven door is re-closed with some of the food remaining inside, there may be additional concerns of Bishul on Shabbos, depending on the circumstances.]  The thermostat is not a concern for Yom Tov use, but there are additional problems with a oven on Yom Tov as detailed below.
If the oven is off, like after the cook-time or stop time has finished this would not be an issue.
the problem with using such an oven on Yom Tov is primarily a practical one; most modern ovens have an auto shut-off feature that turns the oven off after around 6-12 hours. Yet another problem, applicable on both Shabbos and Yom Tov, is that many models have lights or fans that are activated and deactivated as the door is opened or closed. In summary, a modern oven without Sabbath Mode may be completely unusable on Shabbos and Yom Tov.
Ovens with “Sabbath Mode”:
Buying an oven with Sabbath Mode will alleviate many of these problems. Sabbath Mode will generally disable the oven’s display panel and any electronic controls, as well as disengage the fans and lights from being activated by opening and closing the oven door. The Sabbath Mode feature will also disable the auto shut-off feature. However, one very big problem, at least with regards to most models, is that the thermostat usually remains operative. [Some ovens have a light which illuminates when the heating element is on, in which case the oven could theoretically be opened when the light is on. However, it has been demonstrated through rigorous testing that these indicator lights are generally inaccurate, and may be illuminated even when the heating element is off.]
The thermostat does not present a problem for Yom Tov use, but makes it completely forbidden on Shabbos, according to most opinions. The outcome is that, ironically, the Sabbath Mode oven remains forbidden for Shabbos use, and is permitted only on Yom Tov. Perhaps it would have been more apt to name this feature “Yom Tov Mode”.

 In which tone should Shmoneh Esreh be recited?,"
Here is a quote from the Alter Rebbe’s Shulchan Aruch (OCH 101:2):
“One should not pray in his heart alone. Rather, he should articulate the words with his lips and whisper them audibly [the literal translation of the original would be: “make them heard by his ears”]. He should not, however, make his voice heard (by someone standing more than four cubits away), as it is written [regarding Chanh in I Shmuel 1:13] , “Only her lips were moving, but her voice was not heard.” A person who projects his voice during She­moneh Esreh is one of those whose faith is meager — as if the Holy One, blessed be He, would not hear a whispered prayer. (The Sages ordained that Shemoneh Esreh should be uttered in an absolute whisper, i.e., it should be heard by one’s own ears alone, so as not to embarrass transgressors who confess their sins when praying.)
Now, the Zoher and some Mekubalim (referenced in Likkutei Sichos vol. 35 in the Sicha (1) for Parshas Vayigash) hold that although one must verbalize his words, it should still be done completely quietly that even one himself shouldn’t hear himself. (This is because uncording to Kabbalah She­moneh Esreh is an expression of the highest level of Bittul where one’s entire being is completely nullified, thus his voice isn’t heard).
I have yet to find any reliable source which says that in this case we should follow the mekubalim, and there are Poskim (also brought by the Rebbe in that Sicha) who write that this instruction of the Arizal was a horoah l’yochid, and wasn’t directed to the public.

 Is there any reason why women don’t do Mayim Achronim?,"Strictly speaking, there is no difference between men and women. Nonetheless, the custom has developed that women are lenient in this matter.
The suggested explanation for the leniency among women is because nowadays washing Mayim Acharonim is considered as a Chumra and women haven’t taken it upon their self.
More specifically, there are generally three reasons for washing Mayim Acharonim:
A concern for a particular type of salt which when touches the eye can cause blindness.
Because the hands are dirty from food and one may not Bentch reciting Hashem’s name with dirty hands.
According to Kabalah, the purpose of Mayim Acharonim is to give the “other side” (evil forces) a small portion of the meal so that they don’t prosecute against us.
The Poskim mention that there are those who are not accustomed to wash because this type of salt is no longer common. As for the dirty hands, since nowadays people are not particular to wash their hands after meals, thus this wouldn’t be considered an obstacle to Benching. An additional explanation (mentioned specifically with regards to women) is that they are careful to eat with spoons and forks, and their hands do not touch the actual food. As for the Kabbalistic reason, women generally are not accustomed to follow Kabbalistic practices. Therefore, since washing Mayim Acharonim nowadays is considered an extra stringency women have not adopted this practice.
Of course, the above is only an explanation of an existing custom common among women. Clearly, if a woman knows her hands are dirty she may not Bentch without washing her hands first. Even absent the dirty hands, it is recommended – but not obligatory – that woman always wash Mayim Acharonim, without calling attention to her practice.","###question

A concern for a particular type of salt which when touches the eye can cause blindness.
Because the hands are dirty from food and one may not Bentch reciting Hashem’s name with dirty hands.
According to Kabalah, the purpose of Mayim Acharonim is to give the “other side” (evil forces) a small portion of the meal so that they don’t prosecute against us.
The Poskim mention that there are those who are not accustomed to wash because this type of salt is no longer common. As for the dirty hands, since nowadays people are not particular to wash their hands after meals, thus this wouldn’t be considered an obstacle to Benching. An additional explanation (mentioned specifically with regards to women) is that they are careful to eat with spoons and forks, and their hands do not touch the actual food. As for the Kabbalistic reason, women generally are not accustomed to follow Kabbalistic practices. Therefore, since washing Mayim Acharonim nowadays is considered an extra stringency women have not adopted this practice.
Of course, the above is only an explanation of an existing custom common among women. Clearly, if a woman knows her hands are dirty she may not Bentch without washing her hands first. Even absent the dirty hands, it is recommended – but not obligatory – that woman always wash Mayim Acharonim, without calling attention to her practice."
" Is a woman permitted to tub bathe and/or swim on an Onas Prisha?
Rav Braun, I am writing to ask if you can please clarify the issue of tub bathing and swimming on an Onas Prisha – both Onah Beinonis and the other Onos (Haflagah and Chodesh).
We have been taught that this is not permitted lechatchilla (nor is internal washing) and if the need is great to swim or bathe (in tub, not shower) that one should ask a Rav, which usually results in being told to do a bedikah prior to swimming or tub bathing on an Onas Prisha.
Iwas told that some poskim hold that if a woman did tub bathe or swim (water reachinginternally, which is unavoidable in such cases) on an onah beinonis, on her own, then she would have to start sheva nekiim over again. The Alter Rebbe does not hold this way, and if a woman did do this, she would not have to begin her count again.
We would like to confirm the issue. Namely, is a woman permitted to tub bathe and/or swim on an Onas Prisha, and in particular on the Onah Beinonis (or a kavuah) at all, or is a bedikah required beforehand, or nothing is required and it is not an issue.","

" When should one get his hair cut before Shavuos this year, since Erev Shavuos is Shabbos?","It is a Mitzvah to have hair cut before every Yom Tov, so as not to enter into Yom Tov unkempt.

" I didn’t see the moon (yet) tonight (Leil Yud daled). Tomorrow night I will be flying. What should I do if I see the moon on the plane, should I do it then or can I / should I push it off until the next night?","If you see the moon on the plane, you should do Kiddush Levana, and not risk the chance of missing Kiddush Levana altogether.
Explanation:
The Minhag is that Kiddush Levana is not performed under a roof (OC 426:4). There are two reasons for this Minhag:
According to the Bach (OC 426), it is disrespectful when one does not make the effort to leave one’s home and go out to greet the king; how much more so when greeting the Shechinah. [It might be argued that this reason does not apply when in an airplane, where it is impossible to “go out and greet the king”, and staying inside is therefore not an act of disrespect.]
According to the Maharil (cited in Magen Avraham OC 426:14), the concern is that there might be Tumah within the building, and it is appropriate that one should greet the Shechinah in a place which is Tahor.
In any case, the Bach rules that this Minhag applies only where practical. In cases where it is not practical to go outdoors, such as an (even mildly) ill person who is housebound, or someone who is frightened of the reactions of the Gentiles, may recite Kiddush Levana at the window. The Bach’s ruling is brought down by the Taz (OC 426:4) and Magen Avraham (ibid) and other Achronim. The Magen Avraham provides another (more obvious) example – when the outdoors is filthy and not befitting the Bracha.
There is a further discussion in the Poskim whether one may view the moon from behind a (transparent glass or plastic) windowpane. The Pri Megadim (Mishbetzos Zahav OC 426:4) rules that one may do so when it is not possible to open the window, such as in your situation. The Birchei Yosef (OC 426:4) seems to conclude that it is unnecessary to open the window at all. [This particular issue is a far-ranging one in Halacha, and also concerns vision through glasses, but the common practice is to be lenient in this matter, especially when the pane is completely transparent.]","###question

This is not proper for a religious crowd. Poskim advise against this. (Men need to look at the speaker, and to have men looking at a woman speak for a long period of time is not Tznius. We find in the Poskim that by the age of 9, it is important to have only male teachers).
Some poskim even forbid it outright.
(See Shaarei Yosher III: 21. Shevet Halevi 3:14. Mishnah Halachos 5:218. 11: 58. L’horos Nasan 1 EH 60:5. Igros Moshe OC 5: 12. See also ibid. 2:36).
However, if the crowd is not religious, and the purpose is to teach them Torah, there could be some room for leniency in very specific scenarios, and one should seek guidance from a Rav."

" A publication wants to print this letter and wants to know if you approve of it?
Do you approve of the following?
I recommend to consider that a couple getting married in their early twenties can expect to spend sixty years together, which is about five hundred thousand hours, and therefore should consider spending at least fifty hours getting to know their potential spouse before marrying them. Fifty hours is the equivalent of ten five hour dates and would only be one ten-thousandth of the time that they can expect to spend together. I think that it is obviously very unwise to marry someone without spending at least fifty hours getting to know them, and I recommend to go on at least ten five-hour dates before marrying someone.","
I don’t approve. Aside of the Hashkafah issues, there are some technical flaws in the logic here.
Couples don’t spend 24 hours a day together. That reduces your amount of hours significantly.
There is also no solid evidence that getting to know someone better, or for more time before marriage has bearing on the success rate of the marriage. Even if it does has bearing, as some argue, it’s obvious that serious commitment and shared goals are the ultimate influences on the durability of the marriage.
It should be noted that in many other circles they hardly see each other before marriage and they have a high success rate of lasting marriages. Historically, our ancestors who hardly dated also have a history of longer-lasting marriages.","###question

" Is one who finds it harmful to eat dairy permitted to eat chicken during the Nine Days?
I saw in Kitzur Shulchon Aruch (122:8) that one who finds it harmful to eat dairy they are permitted to eat meat of a chicken. Is this accurate? If yes, am I permitted to eat chicken as I am highly allergic to all dairy products to the extent where I carry an EpiPen where ever I go, G-d forbid I need it.","
That is correct.
The reason for abstaining from meat during the Nine Days is twofold:
Because meat is associated with joy.
Because meat is reminiscent of the Korbonos which were halted at the time of the Churban.
These reasons don’t apply to the same degree with regards to chicken – it is not associated to the same degree with joy, and because chicken was not offered up as a Korbon.
Although the Minhag is to abstain from chicken nonetheless, and there is absolutely no leniency for a healthy person, the Bach (552:2) and Magen Avraham (551:28) are lenient for a person to whom dairy is harmful. This is because abstaining from all dairy and all meat for a period of nine days would have a detrimental health effect (Shvus Yaakov §36), and is therefore allowed when needed (Oruch Hashulchan 551:24).
The concern of a detrimental health effect certainly loomed large in times bygone when the range of available food was relatively minimal. Therefore, in our times, when there is a wide range of high protein foods, it would be appropriate to avoid poultry as well if you are absolutely certain that this will not lead to detrimental health effects.","###question

 What Brachah do I say when I see a River or an Ocean?,"Article: A Brachah on Rivers
The brachah of Oseh ma’aseh bereishis (thanking Hashem for the wonders of creation) should be recited when we see a large river that has been around since sheishes yemei breishis (the beginning of creation).
However, if the river has changed course, even if it happened biyedei shamayaim (due to a natural act from Above), we don’t say the brachah. When encountering a river, we needn’t be concerned that its course may have changed over time, but if it’s unknown whether the river dates back to sheishes yemei breishis, no brachah should be said. This is one of the reasons that this brachah is seldom recited, since the provenance of most rivers is unknown. Poskim say, though, that there is no concern with saying the brachah if we see very large rivers, such as the Mississippi.
None of the issues concerning rivers apply to oceans; we certainly should make a brachah when seeing an ocean. Upon seeing the “yam hagadol” (the ‘great ocean’), a special brachah, She’asah es (or Oseh) hayam hagadol, ought to be said. However, since we don’t know which ocean bears that name, we say Oseh maaseh breishis instead. Some maintain that the brachah for the yam hagadol should be recited when seeing any ocean which encircles continents, such as the Atlantic Ocean.
These Brachos are only recited once every 30 days.

One may not engage in any behavior which causes one to engage in laughter or lose focus of mourning. Already from Rosh Chodesh Menachem Av one must decrease acts of happiness.
At the same time we may never fall into depression and must serve Hashem with Simcha. Davening and Avodas Hashem must be B’Simcha. And even the recital of Kinos must involve Simcha that we are privileged to serve Hashem.","###question

" When is the optimal time to put on Rabbeinu Tam Tefillin in a non-Chabad Rosh Chodesh Minyan that doesn’t take a break after U’va Letziyon?
If I’m behind, or if the minyan does not put Rabbeinu Tam (ashkenaz) can I first daven musaf with the minyan and then put Rabbeinu Tam tefillin?","
Our custom is to put on Rabbeinu Tam tefillin before musaf. If the minyan does not wait, one should make every effort to be able put on the tefillin earlier in davening. One should be careful not to remove tefillin shel rosh in the presence of a sefer Torah; they should turn and face the other way or do it under the tallis.
There is also an important idea of having the Rebeinu Tam on as soon as possible when taking off the Rashi Tefillin so that the blessing that was said on Rashi will count for Rebeinu Tam Tefillin (see Shulchan Aruch Admor Hazaken 34:5).
Additionally, based on Kabalah from the Arizal it is not ideal to put on Rebeinu Tam after davening Mussaf, (see Kaf Hachayim Orach Chayim 25:94-96)  since there is a level of Kedushas Musaf and it is no longer the time for Tefillin.
Question:
Could I go ahead of the minyan by saying ashrei and u’va l’tzion in the breaks between aliyos during krias haTorah which would give me time to put Rabbeinu Tam tefillin while the congregation would be saying ashrei and uva letzion or it is better to say ashrey and u’va l’tzion with the minyan to miss davening musaf with the minyan?
Answer: 
It’s better to say ashrei earlier so as not to miss musaf with a minyan. However, you the davener may decide what is best for yourself, (to go ahead of the minyan or not) in this specific case.
In any event, if one takes off his Tefillin before the Sefer Torah is returned to the Ark, he should not do so in the presence of the Sefer Torah, but should turn aside. This is so not to dishonor the Sefer Torah. (See Shulchan Aruch Admur Hazaken Orach Chayim 25:42).","###question

 Am I allowed to eat in a married woman’s kitchen if she does not cover her hair?,"This depends on various factors.

Sefer HaMinhagim records Minhag Chabad as avoiding weddings in Cheshvan.
However, in the later years (5740’s), the Rebbe made it clear that it is far more preferable to make a wedding as soon as possible, even if this means that it will occur in Cheshvan."

 Do stockings for women’s legwear need to be opaque?,"Questions:
1. Must a woman’s stockings be opaque (I.e. the leg isn’t seen through the stockings)?
2. Is it permissible to wear stockings which cover the leg completely (no holes), are somewhat sheer (can see the leg through hosiery) but are visibly not the woman’s leg (I.e. there is a seam or design, or the color is darker than the leg/black)
Answers:
The area below the knee is considered the Shok and thus is an Ervah and therefore must be covered. The denier of the stockings should be such that it is impossible to see the legs through the stockings. Yet, it need not conceal the shape of the leg. Some suggest the number 40 and others suggest higher numbers.
There are many women who are accustomed to wearing stockings of a lesser denier. While this goes against the straightforward understanding of the halacha, there is some room within halacha to defend those do so, as long as it blurs the image of the leg. Lechatchila one should be Machmir that the skin shouldn’t be visible at all, as above.","###question

 Is an oven with Sabbath Mode truly acceptable for Shabbos use?,"There are many ovens on the market, and it is impossible in this short space to investigate and address every single model. The best we can do is provide a summary of the many issues to look out for. It is important that you read through the manuals of any model you are considering for purchase, in order to determine whether, and to what degree, the issues outlined below apply.
Modern ovens without “Sabbath Mode”:
First, let us focus on modern ovens which do not have a Sabbath Mode feature. Such ovens are challenging to use for Shabbos and Yom Tov, for a number of reasons. The main problem with using them on Shabbos is the thermostat, which is affected by opening or closing the oven. When the oven door is opened, the thermostat will detect the cold air that rushes in and will activate the heating element if it is off at that moment. It is forbidden to cause this to occur, even if all the food will be removed all at once before the oven door is re-closed. [If the oven door is re-closed with some of the food remaining inside, there may be additional concerns of Bishul on Shabbos, depending on the circumstances.]
The thermostat is not a concern for Yom Tov use, but the problem with using such an oven on Yom Tov is primarily a practical one; most modern ovens have an auto shut-off feature that turns the oven off after around 6-12 hours. Yet another problem, applicable on both Shabbos and Yom Tov, is that many models have lights or fans that are activated and deactivated as the door is opened or closed. In summary, a modern oven without Sabbath Mode may be completely unusable on Shabbos and Yom Tov.
Ovens with “Sabbath Mode”:
Buying an oven with Sabbath Mode will alleviate many of these problems. Sabbath Mode will generally disable the oven’s display panel and any electronic controls, as well as disengage the fans and lights from being activated by opening and closing the oven door. The Sabbath Mode feature will also disable the auto shut-off feature. However, one very big problem, at least with regards to most models, is that the thermostat usually remains operative. [Some ovens have a light which illuminates when the heating element is on, in which case the oven could theoretically be opened when the light is on. However, it has been demonstrated through rigorous testing that these indicator lights are generally inaccurate, and may be illuminated even when the heating element is off.]
The thermostat does not present a problem for Yom Tov use, but makes it completely forbidden on Shabbos, according to most opinions. The outcome is that, ironically, the Sabbath Mode oven remains forbidden for Shabbos use, and is permitted only on Yom Tov. Perhaps it would have been more apt to name this feature “Yom Tov Mode”.
There is a practical workaround for Shabbos use that is easy and simple: Estimate about what time the main course will be served, and make sure that the oven turns off before then. This is generally easy to achieve, as the Sabbath Mode feature can usually be set to turn the oven off in any increment amount of time up until 72 or 96 hours. So, you can easily set the oven to go off after 2 or 3 hours, for example. Once the oven is off, opening the door does not create a problem with regards to the thermostat.
However, this method will usually create a new problem, which requires its own workaround. Now that the oven is off, this means that Sabbath Mode is now deactivated as well, and opening the door will turn the light on (if the oven has a light). This can be circumvented before Shabbos by manipulating the magnets or levers that detect whether the door is open. The specific manner of circumvention will vary from model to model, and in the case of magnetic detectors, may take some trial-and-error. Some oven doors are designed to be taken apart to allow proper cleaning of all the glass panes, and the magnet can be physically removed from the door. In other models, it may work to place a strong and thin magnet on the oven wall at the correct place. (The location of the oven’s magnet can usually be detected by sliding a paperclip around the top of the oven door.) These options may or may not work, depending on the model, so you would have to try before Shabbos, when you have the time and patience to troubleshoot it. [Note: Disabling the magnetic sensor only helps with regards to the functions controlled by the door sensor, such as the oven light and fans. However, the thermostat is not controlled by the door sensor, which is why the oven needs to be off before opening the door on Shabbos.]
Following the advice above, when Shabbos is followed by Yom Tov, one would have to choose whether to reserve the oven’s use for Shabbos or Yom Tov, as using it on Shabbos would require the oven to be set to turn off on Shabbos, in which case it will remain off for the duration of Yom Tov as well.
The Issur of Shehiya with regards to an oven:
The above answer focuses purely on using the oven itself. However, there are also restrictions about which foods may be placed in an oven before Shabbos without a Blech, and much discussion about whether, and how, a Blech can be facilitated in an oven. Here is a brief summary of the issues:
From the Torah perspective, one may place food over an open flame before Shabbos in order that it cooks on Shabbos. Nevertheless, Chazal forbade this due to the concern that a person may come to stoke the fire on Shabbos in order to speed up the cooking process. This prohibition is known as Shehiya.
One method of avoiding Shehiya is to cover the flames, typically with a Blech. Covering the fire indicates that one does not desire a strong flame, it diverts his attention from the fire, and it serves as a reminder not to increase the flames. With regards to an oven, there is a dispute whether – and how – a Blech can be adequately created. In practice, a Blech in an oven should be situated so that it covers the heating elements, which may be located either at the top of the oven, the bottom or the back-wall. In many ovens, there are heating elements in all of these places.
Another way of addressing Shehiya, and to sidestep the need for a Blech, is to ensure that the food is cooked prior to Shabbos. It is sufficient if the food is already half cooked.  This fraction does not represent time, but rather, is qualitative and measured against the degree of cooking most people would regard as fully cooked. Nevertheless, for a number of reasons, it is best that the food be fully baked before Shabbos.
There is yet a third possible way to circumvent the prohibition of Shehiya. Chazal allowed one to put completely raw meat on an open flame just before the onset of Shabbos. They were not concerned that one might come to stoke the flames, because doing so would not serve any productive purpose – it would not ready the meat in time for the Friday night meal, nor would it be necessary to ready the meat in time for the Shabbos day meal. This leniency is known as “Kidra Chaysa” – literally: raw pot. (Indeed, some people may wish to put raw chicken and rice right before Shabbos to slow bake in the oven for the daytime Seudas Shabbos.)
In order for this leniency to apply, two criteria must be met. First, the food item must be one that takes a relatively long time to cook properly (such as meat). Second, the food must be put on the fire just before Shabbos, late enough that it will not begin cooking before Shabbos comes in. Some contemporary Poskim therefore assert that this leniency seldom applies nowadays, because most modern cooking appliances are able to cook in a relatively short amount of time. As a case in point, meat put up to cook right at the onset of Shabbos would usually be fit for consumption by the time the meat course  arrives. Even if the heat is set to low, this does not diminish the oven’s overall ability to bake quickly, because the seat heating can be easily raised. Thus, according to these Poskim, this option is not applicable to a modern oven.
Other associated issues:
1. It should be pointed out that even when the oven is off and cold, if it will be turned on with a Shabbos clock or a timer (see next point), one may not place inside any food which is not completely cooked. Furthermore, even completely cooked food that has cooled down may not be placed inside either, unless the food is completely dry (and will remain dry when heated). The same applies to an oven which will remain off but has  not yet cooled down.
2. With regards to Shabbos clocks in general, the Rebbe writes in a letter (Igros Kodesh Vol 12 page 192): “There are those who are extremely stringent and are even skeptical about the permissibility of using a Shabbos clock… Therefore, I am abstaining from giving this idea in an official capacity.” Even so, it is reported that the Rebbe instructed some individuals that they may be used (See Shulchan Menachem Volume 2 page 173). At the same time, many authorities who permit Shabbos clocks in general nevertheless rule that they should not be used with regards to cooking specifically, for a number of reasons.

This is generally easy to achieve, as the Sabbath Mode feature can usually be set to turn the oven off in any increment amount of time up until 72 or 96 hours. So, you can easily set the oven to go off after 2 or 3 hours, for example. Once the oven is off, opening the door does not create a problem with regards to the thermostat.
However, this method will usually create a new problem, which requires its own workaround. Now that the oven is off, this means that Sabbath Mode is now deactivated as well, and opening the door will turn the light on (if the oven has a light). This can be circumvented before Shabbos by manipulating the magnets or levers that detect whether the door is open. The specific manner of circumvention will vary from model to model, and in the case of magnetic detectors, may take some trial-and-error. Some oven doors are designed to be taken apart to allow proper cleaning of all the glass panes, and the magnet can be physically removed from the door. In other models, it may work to place a strong and thin magnet on the oven wall at the correct place. (The location of the oven’s magnet can usually be detected by sliding a paperclip around the top of the oven door.) These options may or may not work, depending on the model, so you would have to try before Shabbos, when you have the time and patience to troubleshoot it. [Note: Disabling the magnetic sensor only helps with regards to the functions controlled by the door sensor, such as the oven light and fans. However, the thermostat is not controlled by the door sensor, which is why the oven needs to be off before opening the door on Shabbos.]
Following the advice above, when Shabbos is followed by Yom Tov, one would have to choose whether to reserve the oven’s use for Shabbos or Yom Tov, as using it on Shabbos would require the oven to be set to turn off on Shabbos, in which case it will remain off for the duration of Yom Tov as well.
The Issur of Shehiya with regards to an oven:
The above answer focuses purely on using the oven itself. However, there are also restrictions about which foods may be placed in an oven before Shabbos without a Blech, and much discussion about whether, and how, a Blech can be facilitated in an oven. Here is a brief summary of the issues:
From the Torah perspective, one may place food over an open flame before Shabbos in order that it cooks on Shabbos. Nevertheless, Chazal forbade this due to the concern that a person may come to stoke the fire on Shabbos in order to speed up the cooking process. This prohibition is known as Shehiya.
One method of avoiding Shehiya is to cover the flames, typically with a Blech. Covering the fire indicates that one does not desire a strong flame, it diverts his attention from the fire, and it serves as a reminder not to increase the flames. With regards to an oven, there is a dispute whether – and how – a Blech can be adequately created. In practice, a Blech in an oven should be situated so that it covers the heating elements, which may be located either at the top of the oven, the bottom or the back-wall. In many ovens, there are heating elements in all of these places.
Another way of addressing Shehiya, and to sidestep the need for a Blech, is to ensure that the food is cooked prior to Shabbos. It is sufficient if the food is already half cooked.  This fraction does not represent time, but rather, is qualitative and measured against the degree of cooking most people would regard as fully cooked. Nevertheless, for a number of reasons, it is best that the food be fully baked before Shabbos.
There is yet a third possible way to circumvent the prohibition of Shehiya. Chazal allowed one to put completely raw meat on an open flame just before the onset of Shabbos. They were not concerned that one might come to stoke the flames, because doing so would not serve any productive purpose – it would not ready the meat in time for the Friday night meal, nor would it be necessary to ready the meat in time for the Shabbos day meal. This leniency is known as “Kidra Chaysa” – literally: raw pot. (Indeed, some people may wish to put raw chicken and rice right before Shabbos to slow bake in the oven for the daytime Seudas Shabbos.)
In order for this leniency to apply, two criteria must be met. First, the food item must be one that takes a relatively long time to cook properly (such as meat). Second, the food must be put on the fire just before Shabbos, late enough that it will not begin cooking before Shabbos comes in. Some contemporary Poskim therefore assert that this leniency seldom applies nowadays, because most modern cooking appliances are able to cook in a relatively short amount of time. As a case in point, meat put up to cook right at the onset of Shabbos would usually be fit for consumption by the time the meat course  arrives. Even if the heat is set to low, this does not diminish the oven’s overall ability to bake quickly, because the seat heating can be easily raised. Thus, according to these Poskim, this option is not applicable to a modern oven.
Other associated issues:
1. It should be pointed out that even when the oven is off and cold, if it will be turned on with a Shabbos clock or a timer (see next point), one may not place inside any food which is not completely cooked. Furthermore, even completely cooked food that has cooled down may not be placed inside either, unless the food is completely dry (and will remain dry when heated). The same applies to an oven which will remain off but has  not yet cooled down.
2. With regards to Shabbos clocks in general, the Rebbe writes in a letter (Igros Kodesh Vol 12 page 192): “There are those who are extremely stringent and are even skeptical about the permissibility of using a Shabbos clock… Therefore, I am abstaining from giving this idea in an official capacity.” Even so, it is reported that the Rebbe instructed some individuals that they may be used (See Shulchan Menachem Volume 2 page 173). At the same time, many authorities who permit Shabbos clocks in general nevertheless rule that they should not be used with regards to cooking specifically, for a number of reasons.

The custom is to have a curtain always covering the Aron Kodesh’s door. This is not only to beautify the Aron Kodesh but a sign of modesty.

"I know the minhag of many is Not to make kiddush between six and seven. This was what I remember my custom in my parents home. My question is, sometime this leads to stress in the house either rushing through Sholom Aleichim to get on time and rushing from shul home. On the other hand we have a house of young children at home and waiting till seven can lead to chaos some times. Kids are impatient and hungry. In addition we have guests and this can add pressure. Is there room to be maikel on this custom?","
Although this minhag is brought in the Alter Rebbe’s Shulchan Aruch (271:3), it is a minhag and not a Din. Chazal teach us that great is peace, for the whole Torah was given only to make peace in the world. Accordingly, the mitzva of sholom overrides this minhag. Furthermore, we find that Shalom Bayis outweighs the entire mitzvah of kiddush, for, according to halacha, if one cannot afford both Shabbos candles and wine for kiddush, he should buy only candles since they are there for the purpose of Shalom Bayis.
At the same time, It is highly recommended that one do their best to explain to family members that this is our minhag and the significance of observing minhagim, especially a minhag mentioned in Poskim. In fact, some consider this an issue of potential sakanah which is often deemed more serious than matters of issur. Generally speaking, observing Torah customs bring about more peace and stability in the home and shouldn’t cause conflict. The conflict usually stems from an inadequate presentation and packaging of the issue. If the family perceives the significance of this issue, they would fully appreciate your behavior.
Obviously, if despite all attempts to present things in the proper manner it still appears to cause stress or tension, or if it affects the atmosphere in the house (,), then one definitely should not wait.
When Kiddush is made within the hour wait time it should be made immediately upon arrival home from shul, with as least delay as possible.
Alternatively one may make kiddush before going to shul, even before dark. Although this is not the usual Lubavitch minhag, it is preferable than making Kiddush during the hour.
Guests – the Rebbe writes that this minhag applies even in the event of guests, since it is a sakana issue. However it is still restricted to what I wrote above.
Children – children do not need to wait for kiddush to eat, not even for chinuch. Most likely the situation can be ameliorated somewhat if they are given something to eat until kiddush is made. In fact, if they are hungry one is not allowed to stop them from eating.","###question

" A home, with a full Kosher kitchen, had Goyim working there as home attendants during a span of several years. Do all the dishes need to be Kasherd?
A home had goyim and not observant yidden working there as home attendants (one at a time) throughout the day and night during a span of several years.
In this home, there was a kosher kitchen with multiple cabinets and closets of many pots, pans, utensils, etc. In addition to the workers’ being instructed not to touch any dishes, throughout the years of this situation, there were always family members coming in and out at random hours of day and night checking up (although there may have been some shifts/days during which no family members came, but they were never informed if/when family would show up). Sometimes residing extremely close by.
In more recent times, there were also cameras installed. Despite that, there were several times (not many) which certain workers (of which there were various, different years brought different ones, but only one at a time) were caught using a utensil or about to use one. It remains unknown if there many other such instances in which they weren’t caught. Though it would have possibly been noticed if a utensil was left out.
Please note that they weren’t authorized to cook and so there was no cooking taking place. There was a kettle which they used to make hot drinks for the kosher patient and perhaps for their own food.

"My wife had a shorter veses haflaga kavua. She has now established a longer veses haflaga kavua without three consecutive clean occasions at the shorter veses. What is the current status for the shorter veses kavua? Does she need to keep both, or just the longer? If just the longer, under what circumstances will the shorter resurrect? Upon one occurrence or three?
The basic point is that she first saw after 49 clean periods, and never had an opportunity to take that off the calendar because she always saw before then. Over the following years, she established a veses haflagah kavua for 48 clean periods. However, on 18 Tammuz in the day, she saw again after 49 periods, so that made two times for after 49 clean periods. in the next two months (Av and Elul) she saw after 47 clean periods, even earlier than the 48 veses kavua. In Tishrei she saw even earlier after 45 periods. Then in Cheshvon, she saw again after 49 periods, for the third time at after 49 periods.
So, to sum it up, she hadn’t seen three times clean after 48 without at least one occurrence of after 48 in the middle, but still saw three consecutive times after 49 clean when presented with that opportunity.","
The first haflagah of 49 became uprooted once she established the shorter veses kavua. Therefore she only has two haflagos of 49 and has not yet established a new kavua.","###question

 Is it permissible to go paintball shooting?,"It is important to point out that if this is regarding a camp activity, then whatever written further below has no bearing on what should be done in camp. The purpose of this answer is not for staff members – in contrast to the director – to take this answer and make a Balagan in camp with it. The camp has their Rav who they ask their Shailos to, and that is what is to be followed in the camp B’Poel Mamosh. 
According to Halacha, one should not hit oneself nor shall he hit anyone else even if he gives permission, for it is not his body to give permission to hurt (and an Issur D’Oraysa might be involved).
Some Rabbonim permit paintball shooting as a school or camp activity to encourage learning and/or proper behavior (i.e. as a trip for for good learning) – similar to the concept of hitting a child to help his learning.
Others argue that it is only Assur to hurt someone if done in a harmful manner, however, since paintball shooting is done in a friendly manner there is no Issur involved. Nonetheless, this Heter should only be used if it is L’Toieles.
Indeed, tackle football is regularly played in many otherwise religious schools and camps. However, there is an obvious distinction since here there are guns used for shooting and hurting, while tackling is not officially to attack.
While these arguments might justify the Minhag to be lenient, there is strong room to adopt a stringent approach, as per the straightforward reading of Halacha (referenced below).
I would add that if we don’t steal the Afikoman, which is a Minhag because it involved stealing, even though it’s only a game, we definitely shouldn’t shoot other Yidden and hurt them, even as a game. It appears to be very against our Shito. As mentioned, camps must formulate a policy with their local Rav on this matter.

Your son need not move away every Shabbos if it involves a great tircha. You may come for Shabbos in the case where your presence is deemed a great need, or if it is considered a mitzvah. Certainly, if you assist with shlichus activities over Shabbos there you may attend for Shabbos. In such a case, it is not only permissible but also commendable.

" What is the minimum of Challah one can eat and still be able to wash & Bentch?
I try to keep the minhag of melave malka every week, including washing. Sometimes it’s hard to eat a lot after having eaten recently at the Shabbos meal…
What is the minimum of challah/Matzah one can eat and still be able to wash/bentch?
Over the years I’ve seen many different places where there is a weight amount or, worse yet, a description such as “kazayis” or “kabeitza” to describe food shiurim, and those leave a person very confused as to the exact amount of food. Would the Rav be so kind as to describe the size of a piece of challah or the amount of matzah (usually box Square Matzah)? (E.g. The amount of challah comparable to a golf ball or two golf balls etc or a different item that the challah could be measured against).
Additionally, does the shiur consist of only the hamotzi food, or could something that’s put on top of the challah/matzah also count as part of the shiur? (Let’s say if someone puts egg salad or tuna salad on challah, can this be counted and this way one eats let’s of the actual hamotzi food but can nevertheless still wash and bench).
And finally, is there a time frame in which one needs to eat the shiur?","
One must wash (without a Bracha) and make Hamotzi for even the smallest amount.
One must wash with a Bracha if he’s planning on eating a K’beitza. This is approximately 2 K’zeizim. Each K’zayis should be eaten within K’dei Achilas Pras (= 4 minutes) and without pausing between the two of them.
One must make a Birchas Hamazon if he ate a K’zayis of bread within 4 minutes. Other foods do not count for this amount.
If 4 minutes proves to be too difficult, one can be lenient and eat it within 6 minutes but should eat approximately the size of 1/3 of a K’beitza within 4 minutes. If one is not sure if it was eaten in the right amount of time – if he is satiated, he should still make a Birchas Hamazon.
Torah measurements are usually volume-based, not weight. A K’zayis is the approximate volume of half an average size egg. A K’beizah is the volume of an average size egg. Nonetheless, for simplicity, they have been converted to weight measurements, although the weight measurements are far from accurate. This is because different foods with an equal volume weigh differently. The following is the weight for water; bread and certainly matzah weighs less. For a K’beitza this is approx. 53.8 gram or 1.89 oz. For a K’zayis, approx. 25.6 gram or 0.90 oz.
One-third of a standard square machine matza is approximately a K’zayis. With bread, it is harder to measure, as they are not uniform but it is approximately the size of what would fit into a small l’chaim cup. In order to be safe, one should err on the side of caution and eat slightly more than the shiur, due to a number of reasons, among them since some crumbs remain between the teeth.

I’ll start off with an anecdote:
A man was stuck on his rooftop in a flood. He was praying to G-d for help.
Soon a man in a rowboat came by and the fellow shouted to the man on the roof, “jump in, I can save you.” The stranded man shouted back, “no, it’s OK, I’m praying to G-d and he is going to save me.” So the rowboat went on.
Then a motorboat came by. The fellow in the motorboat shouted, “jump in, I can save you.” To this the stranded man said, “No thanks, I’m praying to G-d and he is going to save me. I have faith.” So the motorboat went on.
Then a helicopter came by and the pilot shouted down, “Grab this rope and I will lift you to safety.” To this the stranded man again replied, “No thanks, I’m praying to G-d and he is going to save me. I have faith.” So the helicopter reluctantly flew away.
Soon the water rose above the rooftop and the man drowned. He went “upstairs”. He finally got his chance to discuss this whole situation with G-d, at which point he exclaimed, “I had faith in you but you didn’t save me, you let me drown. I don’t understand why!”
To this G-d replied, “I sent you a rowboat and a motorboat and a helicopter, what more did you expect?”
And now to answer your question:
The Torah instructs us to protect our lives in every way possible, spiritual and physical. Obviously, in the event of physical danger r”l, in addition to applying spiritual protection, we must do all we can to protect ourselves in a physical way, following standard security procedures. (This should be discussed with the local security agencies, police department, etc., in conjunction with the local Rav/Shliach).
One can ask the same question regarding Hashem’s protection in general: we are promised that “the guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps”. Should that mean that we should not apply physical protection as well? Should a Jewish soldier not wear a helmet? Obviously not.
So too in regards to mezuzah: we are taught that the mitzvah of mezuzah brings longevity to those who keep it, and even more –  it provides protection to the house and its residents (even when they are outside of the house), and to all Yidden throughout the world. However, in the event of physical danger r”l, we must apply physical protection in addition to making sure we have kosher mezuzahs affixed to our doorposts. This does not in any way imply that the mezuza is an insufficient measure of protection, rather, that Hashem will help our standard security procedures in the merit of the mezuza.
We find a similar idea regarding parnasa: while the Torah teaches us that it is Hashem’s blessing which gives a person parnasa, everyone understands that this blessing needs a “vessel” in which to rest. For someone to say that he won’t work because he is relying on Hashem’s Bracha is foolish and wrong. So too we must take natural measures in security issues, and one who refrains from doing this is held responsible.
A story to illustrate: there was a chosid who experienced a break-in to his vehicle and asked the Rebbe (amongst other things) if he should check his mezuzas. The Rebbe answered that he should make sure the vehicle is locked at night.","###question

Scientifically: It is highly debatable whether scientifically there is any health advantage to this practice. See for example here.
Halachicly: I’ll focus only on the halachic aspect. Eating placenta per se is problematic according to Halacha as human flesh is forbidden to be eaten. It might also fall under the category of mi’us. (Note that customarily placenta used to be buried – certainly not eaten).
A leniency could be justified only for sick people who need medication. Nonetheless, when ground and encapsulated there is more room for leniency.
However, being that this isn’t a “recognized cure” (refuah yeduah) it’s not so lchatchillah. If there are other alternatives available, or if it’s not really that important, one shouldn’t use this method.","###question

 Does one need to ask a Rav before being induced? Is there any Halachic issue?,"
This matter is discussed in a number of Poskim. The general rule is that one may not induce or rush the onset of labor unless there are clear medical reasons to require it. Some of the reasons for this prohibition are because:
There is a level of risk inherent to childbirth, and one should therefore not hasten it even though it is bound to come.
The special assurance of protection Hashem provides at the time of childbirth does not necessarily apply to the same degree if the birth is hastened without a clear medical need.
The procedures and/or medicines involved in induction can themselves cause complications, and one should not take that risk needlessly.","###question

 There is a prohibition to Kovaya Seuda before davening in case they might forget to daven before the zman tefilla, however, one is allowed to snack on fruits and other foods and eat bread or mezonos up to a beitza (2 kzaysim).
Before Shacharis, one may not eat at all. If not eating disturbs one’s kavanah in davening, one may be lenient to eat before Shacharis. Chassidim would be particular to eat before Shacharis in such cases. But since the purpose was not to be kovaya seudah they would ordinarily eat mezonos and not bread. Bichlal, one may not eat more than a kebeitza. Generally, Mashpiim in Lubavitch preferred mezonos over bread.
Q. Is there a difference between men and women?
A. There is room to be meikel for a woman since there is an opinion that woman can fulfill their chiyuv of Tefilla with a short bakasha, a request of Hashem, in the morning."
 Article: Do I have to fast?,"The most stringent of all fast days is Yom Kippur, since fasting is min haTorah (a Biblical law), as the passuk in Parashas Acharei Mos says: “Ta’anu es nafshoseichem” (afflict your souls)—and the severe punishment for not fasting is kareis (early death by Divine decree). Only a heter (dispensation) dispensed by a rav in critical circumstances and in a strictly prescribed manner would allow breaking the fast. A choleh she’ein bo sakanah (a person who has a non-life threatening illness) and similarly, a woman who is expecting or nursing (under normal circumstances), must fast.
Four other fasts are rooted in divrei kabbalah (the words of receiving, i.e. from the Prophets): Tzom Gedaliah, Asara B’Teves, Shiva’a Asar B’Tammuz and Tisha B’Av, and they are subject to stricter rules than for other laws mi’d’rabbanan (of Rabbinic origin). (Taanis Esther is in a different category of minhag—custom.)
Tisha B’Av, due to its history of huchpalu bo tzaros (double tragedies), is more stringently observed: We begin fasting at sunset the evening before and observe the additional bodily afflictions as on Yom Kippur. But the other three fasts of divrei kabbalah are more minor; they were instituted for calamities associated with the churban (destruction [of the Temple]) and during times of relative peace afterwards were commemorated only as a standing tradition previously accepted by Klal Yisroel (the Jewish people).
One of the leniencies of these three fasts is that an expectant or nursing mother who is mitzta’eres harbeh (in much physical discomfort) does not have to fast. Poskim state that lav davka (not necessarily) must the discomfort be acute—even some difficulty suffices as a heter. By contrast, a choleh she’ein bo sakanah, and similarly, an expectant or nursing mother who is suffering undue weakness or one who is at a stage of her pregnancy where fasting is deemed unhealthy for her (or for the fetus) and would therefore be considered a choleh—is patur (exempt) from fasting on all four fast days, including Tisha B’Av.
A mother of small children who is not expecting or nursing is not included in this heter, and neither is one who is paid to care for others’ children, as there is hardly a career or calling that exempts an individual from the halachic obligation to fast. One halachic opinion states that women should not have to fast for twenty four months after giving birth (the official halachic time span for nursing) and another exempts all those of childbearing age, but these views are rejected by mainstream poskim.
There is some extra leniency regarding Tzom Gedaliah (compared to the other two fasts of divrei kabbalah) for those who are not otherwise exempt, but would not be physically able to fast on Yom Kippur only one week after fasting on Tzom Gedaliah. In such a case, a rav should be consulted.

" Is Quinoa Kosher for Pesach?
I am very confused about this. All the years I’ve heard that most poskim maintain that quinoa is considered kitniyos. Now I am hearing that there is new information on the topic and that is been agreed that it is not kitniyos.
May I use it on Pesach or not?","
The common consensus of most poskim on this topic is that it is considered kitniyos for all practical purposes. The few kashrus agencies that are authorizing it are pushing this product on the market—and even they maintain that it needs a reliable proper hechsher as it might have some grain mixed into it—but that does not change the consensus within mainstream halacha.
Explanation:
The key argument to permit quinoa is that this is considered a new type of food which wasn’t around when the decree against kitniyos was made and thus it is not included in the original prohibition against kitniyos.
This argument has been repeated many times about different things. However, klal Yisroel has not accepted this argument. The custom is not to use peanuts, and more specifically — corn, even though these foods were not around then.
In fact, the original poskim who mentioned the prohibition against kitniyos do not list the various type of foods. The basic assumption is that anything that has the properties of kitniyos is included. Furthermore, from the extensive discussion in poskim about why potatoes are permitted on Pesach it is clear that the fact that this was a new food was not germane to the discussion.
Quinoa has all the properties of kitniyos and all the reasons mentioned in poskim apply just as much if not more to quinoa. Certainly, it has more similarity to grain than corn does.
It should be noted that even though Rabbi Moshe Feinstein has ruled to permit peanuts, he agreed that corn remains forbidden. His son Rabbi Dovid Feinstein states clearly that the same applies to quinoa. (The arguments to distinguish between corn and quinoa based on its Yiddish name and its high popularity are a far stretch and inconsistent with the position of Reb Moshe himself. It is obvious that Reb Moshe’s position to allow peanuts is not based on the sole factor of it being a new food. He explained elsewhere why corn remains forbidden because it fits well with the general criteria of kitniyos, unlike potatoes and peanuts. Accordingly, in his opinion quinoa should be forbidden. As mentioned this is also the position of his son, Reb Dovid.)
The classification of quinoa as kitniyos applies also the other areas in halacha. With regard to the rules of kilayim for example, it is clear that quinoa is considered kitniyos. There’s no reason to make any distinction when it comes to this very important minhag, which many poskim, including the Tzemach Tzedek, state that it applies even during times of hunger. A proper understanding of the Alter Rebbe words in Shulchan Aruch leads us to this conclusion too.
To the best of my knowledge this is also the position of most Chabad Rabbonim the world over. The position that quinoa is unacceptable as kitniyos is shared by many many contemporary poskim. To name just a few: Rabbi Elyashiv, Rabbi Neubort, Rabbi Shlomo Miller, Rabbi Usher Weiss, Rabbi Westheim — and many other well known kashrus agencies. (For a through treatmet of this matter, see Kovetz Etz Chaim, vol. XXVIII).
The very fact that all those who permit quinoa warn strongly to use it only if it goes through a proper certification process because of the serious concern that it might have a mixture of other grains is telling. Indeed, one of the reasons for the original prohibition against kitniyos is this very fact that it often mixes with other grain.
In conclusion: there’s no reason to change our behavior this year than all previous years. The minhag to forbid kitniyos is an important one and should not be dropped for convenience reasons, without a consensus that a particular food isn’t included. There are many other alternatives for healthy food on the market for Pesach.","###question

 Maaser is intended to benefit the poor. Nonetheless, it is customary to use Maaser money for other non obligatory mitzvos. If this is an obligatory training course, Maaser may not be used. Even if it is optional, it would not be proper to use it to pay for a local teacher training course. However, you may certainly deduct the cost of this teaching course as a “business expense” from your revenue, and you will not need to give Maaser on this amount.
[There are general leniencies in the Halachos of Maaser for one who is struggling to meet basic living expenses, but that is a separate question.]
This is not a endorsement for any course or organization."

 Do filter bags need to have a Hechsher since they are going into soups?,"The filter bags don’t need to be kosher but you must be sure that no bugs can leave the bag.
As for the idea of using such bags to prevent the need for checking: With foods that are certainly infested, one should not do this, but we need not admonish those who do, provided the garment is thick.
Where the food is not definitely infested, it may be done but one should check and clean first superficially.
Explanation in brief:
The bugs that are in the unchecked herbs would give off a bad taste to the soup and would be inconsequential (any non-kosher food that gives a bad taste to a kosher food is called Pagum and doesn’t make the kosher food non-kosher).
Even though one may not intentionally nullify something that is forbidden, here your intention is not to nullify the bugs but rather to add the taste of herbs to the soup.
Even if there is a remote concern that the bugs might have left the bag, we may assume that the bugs stayed in the bag, and even if they left the bag there is an assumption that the bugs became crushed during the cooking process and therefore could be nullified in the soup.","###question

I’m not sure where you heard that. None of us can say with certainty that we know why tragedies happen. It’s true that Torah tells us that when tragedies happen we need to examine our behaviors and see which things require rectification. However, that does not mean that human beings can fathom the ways of Hashem and say that they absolutely know which particular behavior caused this particular tragedy. Even great tzadikim who are sometimes privy to the inner workings of Hashem in this world have many times stated about themselves that they cannot understand the ways of Hashem. Certainly, it is not our job to explain why certain things occurred.
As for your specific question about unfiltered internet: it is absolutely true that this is forbidden according to the Torah. The psak against unfiltered internet has been expressed by almost all Rabbonim from all circles (Chassidic, non-Chassidic, the so-called Modern Orthodox movement, etc.).
Whether such behavior is actually killing people I cannot claim to know, but I do know that it wreaks havoc on a person, his family and immediate surroundings. I guess you can say that it can cause spiritual death which is much worse, in many ways, than physical death. The tragedies caused by unfiltered internet, whether on a personal level, or the harmful effects on a marriage or a relationship, or on one’s connection to Hashem, are very real and are serious, and shouldn’t be underestimated. Thus, the correct thing to do is to immediately obtain proper filtering on your devices and protect yourself and your family. One thing is for sure this will bring great Bracha to yourself and to your loved ones. Just for this reason alone, it’s worthwhile to do so without delay.
Wishing you tremendous success in this resolution.","###question

Sifrei Kabbalah (Holy writings of Kabbalah) relate that the Arizal would refrain from having his hair cut after midday. Some are of the opinion that the same would apply to cutting nails. The question is: what was the reason for this custom?
If it was because we shouldn’t engage in any new melachah (work) once the zman (time) of Mincha has arrived—lest we be distracted from davening Mincha—then we can assume that there is no issue with cutting our hair after having davened Mincha. Nails, however, may be cut even before davening Mincha.

Although the influence of the forces of dinim is mentioned specifically only regarding haircuts, it can arguably be applied to nail cutting too.
Common practice, though, is that we do take haircuts and cut our nails after midday—provided that we have davened Mincha—and at night as well. Likewise, If one has a fixed minyan for davening Mincha, one need not refrain from engaging in melacha prior to davening.","###question

"I want to place bars of sweet-smelling soap as a drawer freshener inside dresser drawers. Would I then have a problem opening those drawers on Shabbos? It’s just a plain, fragrant bar of soap sitting in the drawer. It doesn’t spray anything. I would open the drawer to take out items I need on Shabbos.
I understood from halacha I’ve learned that if there are Muktza items in a drawer together with items I need on Shabbos, I would need to have something like a bencher in the drawer in order to open it. For instance, I have a medicine drawer that contains medicine I need on Shabbos together with creams I don’t use on Shabbos. I put a bencher in that drawer. Is that necessary, or is it going too far?","
I’ll try to give a brief overview:
When a muktza item is placed (purposely, before Shabbos) alone on top of a non-muktza item, it may render the non-muktza item as muktza as well. This is called “bosis l’dovor ho’assur” – a base for a forbidden item.
However, if the muktza item is laying along with a non-muktza item on top of something, and the non-muktza item is of higher value/importance than the muktza item, it does not render that thing as muktza. This is called “bosis l’issur ul’heter” – a base for a forbidden and permitted item.
Based on this:
If your drawer has medicine (or anything else) that is of higher value/importance than the cream, it is no problem to open on Shabbos. Same applies with the soap.
It should be noted that one may not create a good smell on Shabbos if the purpose is the good smell (as opposed to just getting rid of a bad smell). Thus the fragrant soap should not be placed there on Shabbos.","###question

Therefore, a sukkah using canvas or sheets should have bamboo sticks or beams placed horizontally along the walls for the first ten hand-breadths from the ground, with a space of less than three hand-breadths between each beam. As a first recourse, these beams should be set up on all four sides of the sukkah. Some Sukkahs are equipped with such poles.

" Is one allowed to use a basement toilet that uses a pump on Shabbos?
Question continued:
The pump is triggered by a buildup of waste, so it’s not directly triggered by the flush. But after a certain amount of waste gathers, the pump (electric) is triggered. Would one be allowed to use such a toilet on Shabbos?","
If it won’t definitely be activated when you flush, it’s permissible to use.
You can check if you can adjust the “float switch” to be activated with a higher water level which will make it less likely to turn on (or get a large tank).
Additionally you may be able to set some timers with random times so it will only be activated during those times.","###question

" What should I do about Toiveling a dish if I can’t get the sticker completely off? Is it a Chatzitzah?
I have something I need to toivel but the label sticker won’t come off all the way. is it still a chatzitzah or can it be toiveled any way?","
Ideally, one should remove all the stickers or labels from the dishes before the tevila.
However, in a case where the stickers are covering only the minority of the dish and it is in such a manner that most people don’t mind its presence, one may toivel the dishes with the stickers on, if removing them would be a big hassle. If on occasion one minds its presence it’s considered a chatzitzah (intervening substance), and must be removed.
For example, if the sticker is underneath the utensil, we could assume that people aren’t concerned with using the dish while the sticker is underneath.
Labels which contain instructions for usage need not be removed.
Stickers which make the utensil look more expensive, such as a brand name, or if it is there for beauty, need not be removed.
Once one started removing the sticker, it should be removed completely, as people often mind when there is an incomplete sticker or leftovers from a sticker. The glue which remains after the removal of the stickers is not an issue if it has no substance, i.e. it is not felt when touching it. If it does have substance, it must be removed if people mind its presence.","###question

 Medical professionals recommend taking activated charcoal pills for certain stomach conditions . Do these pills require a proper hashgacha?,"Charcoal in itself, is not an issue if it’s vegetarian. The same holds true for the capsule.
When vegetarian is not available:
If a physician / medical professional has advised taking Activated Charcoal due to pain that may sometimes be severe, tasteless – unflavored – pills may be taken.
You may look into getting from Israel with Badatz of Eida Hechsher, or perhaps from Boro Park at KosherVitamins.com.
Explanation:
Non Vegetarian Activated Charcoal Pill can also be made from non-Kosher ingredients, as Bone Char etc. The same applies with the capsule, as it could be made with Gelatin etc.
However, since it’s burned out, not edible and tasteless, we may be lenient in a case of a Chole She-ayn Bo Sakono, which includes strong pain that can be alleviated by taking this pill.
The reason we have not suggested taking the powder out of the capsule is because this particular medicine will thereby lose the effectiveness, and additionally, the capsule is tasteless. (It should be noted that the tablets without the capsules might have a taste, and therefore it is best to use those with the capsule).
All the above applies for a patient with pain experiencing difficulty obtaining Activated Charcoal Pills that are vegetarian or ones with a Hechsher.

" Can we take pictures of our 3-year-old daughter lighting Shabbos candles for the first time?
Can a photo be taken while we are lighting but before the Bracha is over? 
I was planning to light about a half hour early to make sure there is no risk of going into Shabbos.","
Strictly speaking, Halachically, there is no issue.

1. One may only light Shabbos candles after the Zman of Plag Hamincha.
2. Once a woman lights the Shabbos candles (after the above mentioned time), she automatically accepts Shabbos (together with all its laws) upon herself.

Alternatively, when lighting for the first time on a Shabbos, the girl should wear a new garment and recite Shehecheyanu for the same purpose (i.e., so that the Bracha can ‘go’ on the lighting in addition to the new garment).","###question

" Are people allowed to deny a Kohen his Aliyah?
I have seen the seder of aliyos “Kohen-Levi-Yisroel” being disregarded way too many times, especially on Shabbos before Yud Shvat and Simchas Torah, when everyone wants an aliyah. There is no question that if there are no Kohanim or Leviim present there should be no issues, but otherwise, are people allowed to deny a Kohen his aliyah?

If there is a halacha issue to deny the Kohen his aliyah, perhaps there should be a public reminder of this issue?","
As a Kohen, you have no obligation to stand up for your aliya as it is the mitzvah of the congregation to honor the Kohen and not your mitzvah. On the contrary, you should give your permission so that those that need an aliya can receive one.
As a general rule, the first aliya should be given to a Kohen if there is one in shul and it should not be disregarded as it is a Mitzvas Asei.
At certain set times, this was not kept for the benefit of the community such as making money for the shul and the like. But this should be done only if there is such a set Minhag in place.
Also, when there is a great need, there is room to be lenient and call up a Yisroel in the place of a Kohen, but only with the full permission of the Kohen and without disregarding that he is a Kohen (i.e. they should not say “Ein Kan Kohen” – there is no Kohen here when he is actually in the room). This is especially true by mincha shabbos afternoon and by the kriah of Monday and Thursday, where there is more room for leniency.
In practice, in a regular Shul one should not call up a Levi or Yisroel in the place of a Kohen (when there is a Kohen present) unless there is a great financial loss for the shul and/or many chiyuvim, and even so not on a regular basis, the Kohen should give his full permission and leave the Shul,

" Hachnasa L’Cheider After School Hours?
Does a Hachnasa L’Cheider require to have children present or is it perfectly fine doing it with the Melamed after school hours (after the children in the class went home)?","
Although there is no specific recorded Minhag that the Hachnasa L’Cheider is required to be in the presence of other children, since it should be done in a festive way (like carrying golden dishes…) and in a form of celebration (in the child’s eyes as well) it’s sensible to say that it should be done when other children are there, as this is usually the case when there are other children present including them in the festivities.
As general rule: The customs associated with Hachnasa L’Cheider are very precise and addressed in detail in many Seforim, and even in Rishonim. Poskim also admonish us not to deviate from these customs as we don’t know all the reasons for the specific customs. Accordingly, since the common practice is to do it in the presence of other children, it is not recommended to change the common custom, as we don’t know whether this is b’davka or not.
Additionally, it should be done in the morning just like Matan Torah took place in the morning.","###question

Although there is no specific recorded Minhag that the Hachnasa L’Cheider is required to be in the presence of other children, since it should be done in a festive way (like carrying golden dishes…) and in a form of celebration (in the child’s eyes as well) it’s sensible to say that it should be done when other children are there, as this is usually the case when there are other children present including them in the festivities.
As general rule: The customs associated with Hachnasa L’Cheider are very precise and addressed in detail in many Seforim, and even in Rishonim. Poskim also admonish us not to deviate from these customs as we don’t know all the reasons for the specific customs. Accordingly, since the common practice is to do it in the presence of other children, it is not recommended to change the common custom, as we don’t know whether this is b’davka or not.
Additionally, it should be done in the morning just like Matan Torah took place in the morning."

We do not have all the information necessary to be able to decide who is right here, and only a Beis Din that heard the arguments of both sides would have the possibility to decide this matter.

1. It’s very strange that there is no mention of Halacha in this letter, only about the civil law as it has been been determined in the secular courts.
2. Regarding the actual ownership of  Chabad literature, this is an old debate which to the best of my knowledge has yet to be determined in a properly constituted Beis Din.

What does the Rov say?,"
Everything that happens is Behashgacha Pratis.
The only things that aren’t decided by Hashem are a person’s choices. However any consequences that would happen to another individual as a result of those choices would fall under the general rule that everything that happens in this world is decided by Hashem.
Bearing this in mind, there is never a legitimate reason for getting upset at someone for something he or she did to you, for in truth nobody can affect you in any way that Hashem hasn’t pre-planned for you. Hashem has many messengers for his plans and if it weren’t for this individuals action it would happen through someone else’s action or in some other way.
Also the Mishnah (Avos 5:6) teaches us that one should always judge another favorably and should never jump to conclusions.
Obviously every individual on their own have the responsibility to make responsible choices, since their own choices aren’t pre-planned by Hashem. (And when making a mistake they are to take responsibility for their actions).

 Can one give a LGBT person a Aliya or let them be Chazzan?,"Obviously a biological woman will always stay a woman and one may not give them an Aliya or let them be Chazzan regardless of how they look or dress.

Regarding an Aliya to the Torah for individuals that it is not clear how their observance in Torah and Mitzvos is … My answer is that the decision in this matter depends on many details, both in regard to the conduct of the individual who wants to receive an Aliya to the Torah and in regard to those who pray in the Shul and the way they will perceive it. In all matters which are done in public, these issues need also be brought into consideration. And in fitting with what was mentioned, only those who are locals are able to decide. However, it is understood that based on our Sages axiom, “always the right hand should draw closer and the left hand…” one needs to address this question too this way. And specifically when there is a doubt if at all one needs to even push with their left hand, for it is already mentioned, “its ways are pleasant ways and all of its paths are of peace…”

It is self-understood that the concept of ‘Baalei Batim’ belonging to any individual or Mossad, is an incorrect logic. The same holds true with offering a Yid to put on Tefillin (in case Ch”v he did not put on that day) or suggesting to a Woman to light Shabbos candles in a town where there is a Shliach or a Rav of the Community. No one can come with a Taana (claim), “why did you take away my Baal Habos? He should only put on Tefillin with me, the Shliach!” Or “I am His Rabbi!”.
The same would hold true with Mivtza Tzedakah. If your taking of the donation is in no way minimizing their donation to the local Shliach or to any local organization, in such case there is no reason to refrain from being Mezake another Yid with Mivtza Tzedakah.
And Aderabe (on the contrary)– you might even inadvertently assist that local Shliach, as it is common sense that the more a Gevir donates the more Tzedakah it leads him to giving!
On the other hand – If this donation will cause direct damage to the Shliach or any local organization, then it is unacceptable. The Rebbe very much desired that Shluchim should not “step on the toes” of others, especially other Shluchim and that all activities be done in an achdus manner. At times, it could also be an issue of Hasogas Gevul!
Therefore, it really depends on the situation, the donor’s intention and so on.
These nuances should be evaluated beforehand. In general, it’s always a good idea to discuss the issues with the local Shluchim and coordinate activities. There are many letters of the Rebbe along these lines.
Certainly, if the donation is given specifically because you are ‘Chabad’ and due to this their donation to the Shliach will be less, or if the donor is unable to give more than he gave you, (since he gave you a Chomesh etc.), in these (and in similar) cases, you must first discuss it with the local Shliach.","###question

" Are undiscernible Sheitels Kosher?

Also, even if a Sheitel doesn’t have a lace front, making it look like hair growing out of the head, is it ok for ones Sheitel to have a white scalp (I know many people who ask the Sheitel Macher to add more hair so the Sheitel doesn’t bear the look of growing out of the head) so it looks nice, but still evident that its a Sheitel?","
It’s not a concern of mar’is ayin, since it’s well known that religious women wear shaitlach. Certainly, if this type of sheitel becomes common there’s no need to be concerned.

This is usually only an issue with a lace front sheitel (where the lace is only on the front of the shaitel) and one needs to put powders or a band so that one shouldn’t be able to see the hair. A lace top shaitel has a lace on the whole shaitel so usually in order to make it look more natural they put a white lining under the lace so no hair is usually seen.
However, one must ensure that the lining is truly opaque and that the lining extends to the very front where the actual hairline is. It’s not enough to ask the Sheitel macher to ensure that the Sheitel is “kosher”, as there are different types of linings and one must ensure that it is in accordance with Halacha.
Many of the linings sewn in the sheitels available in the market are inadequate as the scalp can be seen through it and one might need to have another lining added.","###question

 Would not wearing a mask result in a Chillul Hashem? ,"Would not wearing a mask in public spaces (when the law demands doing so) result in a Chillul HaShem? 
Yes, if a religious person would not abide by the law which would result in people speaking badly about Jews, it would be included in the prohibition of Chilul Hashem. However, in a place where the law is not adhered to even by the non Jewish residents, it wouldn’t be Chilul Hashem.
What defines a Chillul HaShem?
Colloquially, the term Chilul Hashem is used when referring to a behavior that denigrates Torah observant Jews in the eyes of the general population. However, the actual mitzvah of Chilul Hashem as understood in halacha refers to an action that demonstrates one’s lack of commitment to Hashem in the eyes of the observant. Thus, the main component of this Mitzvah is not to transgress the commandment to sanctify Hashem’s name by giving up one’s life in a time of a decree against the observance of Torah and Mitzvos or when posed with the ultimatum of either giving up one’s life or doing one of the three big prohibitions, idle worship, incest and murder.
Additionally, one who violates any prohibition out of spite would be violating the prohibition of Chilul Hashem as well.
Nonetheless, it has been accepted colloquially to include in the term Chilul Hashem the concept that one should not do anything which would cause people to speak badly about Hashem and those who are loyal to him. The more religious and pious a person is the more they should be careful in their actions not to cause a Chilul Hashem, even by doing something which is completely legal but the onlookers would view it differently.","###question

 How should Kohanim hold their hands during Birchas Kohanim?,"There are many customs with regards to the particular way a Kohen should spread his fingers during N’sias Kapayim, but first, it is important to outline what is Halachically required1:
The Hands are spread only after the Brocho – L’voreich Es Amoi Yisroel B’ahava2 which is said only after turning around to the Tzibur3.
The Hands must be raised to at least Shoulder Height4. If difficult to hold the hands up continuously, they may be lowered only in between the words5. According to many, it’s appropriate to raise the hands slightly higher, up to eye level. This is indeed the common practice. Some also note that the Kohen should attempt to raise not just his hands, but also his arms should be fully raised and extended forward (elbows straightened)6.
The hands/Fingers should be flexed open completely7 with the palms of the hand facing (mostly) downwards8.
When aligning the hands, the right hand should be slightly higher than the left hand9.
Position of the Fingers
The Halachic outline: There is no specification made in this regard until the later Rishonim and thus there isn’t any particular position that is Halachically necessary10.
Nonetheless, the Kohanim customarily separate their fingertips as alluded to in the interpretation by the Midrash of the verse, “peering through the windows” — that the Divine Presence rests above their heads and gazes through the spaces between their fingers.
The fingers are positioned in a manner which leaves five “windows”. This is done by separating each hand into three “sections”—leaving spaces on each hand between the thumb and index finger, and between the middle and ring finger. The fifth space is completed by the way the two thumbs are configured together.
In general, there are two ways to making the fifth space 1) by holding the thumbs apart from each other leaving a gap, 2) by holding the thumbs together but in a “window-like configuration”.  the Alter Rebbe brings both Minhogim11.
Each of the common Minhogim is valid and contains unique meaning12 and should be adhered to if you have a clear family tradition one way or another. (Nonetheless, there are benefits in learning what is the most commonly accepted Minhag in Chabad, as recommended in the letter of the Rebbe in Igros Kodesh referenced above. The Rebbe recommends checking to see if R’ Chaim Noeh wrote anything. See below) 
—
After extensive attempts to find out the particular traditions in the families of generational Kohanim in Anash, it seems fair to conclude that even among longstanding Anash families there are several traditions.
Note: it’s worth pointing out a practical and probable reason for why there isn’t a more uniform Minhag in this regard: According to our Minhag the Kohanim cover their hands with the Tallis, thus nobody other than the kohen’s own (very) young children would ever be seeing how he holds his hands. Additionally, the Zohar warns against looking at the hands of the Kohanim during the Brocho.
It has been written in some places that the common minhag in Chabad is to hold the thumbs apart as per the first opinion in the Alter Rebbe’s Shulchan Aruch, this is also the only way written by R’ Chaim Noeh13.
However our research has indicated that while some Anash families (1) have this tradition, the majority of families do connect the two thumbs in one form or another (as per the second opinion).
The most common form we’ve found among Anash (2) is to connect the two thumbs at their knuckles, thus leaving a fifth window between the tips of their thumbs, as the tips of the thumbs are bent away from each other (see attached image).
The second most common (3) is having the very tips of the thumbs connected to each other, followed by having the thumbs apart (as above), followed further by other less common forms of connecting the thumbs.

" What is the minimum size Tzitzis for children under Bar Mitzvah?
Regarding after Bar Mitzvah:
Can the garment of the 2 shoulders on the sides of the hole count towards the front/back Amos?
I vaguely recall Reb Chaim Naeh writing that if the shoulder parts are a certain width, then they can count towards the length of the front/back.","
Under Bar Mitzvah:
The Alter Rebbe rules in the Siddur that the age of Chinuch begins at six. Nevertheless, Minhag Chabad is to begin at the age of three, based on directives of the Frierdiker Rebbe and the Rebbe.
See here regarding a child under the age of 3:
Is it encouraged or discouraged for a child under 3, and not toilet trained to put on Tzitzis?
According to many Poskim, the Mitzvah of Chinuch does not just mean that the child thinks that he is doing the Mitzvah, but he has to actually be doing it for real. Therefore, the child has to be given Tzitzis which are Kosher. [If this is difficult, (e.g. it is very normal for young children to constantly rip their Tzitzis,) perhaps there is room to rely on the lenient opinions (as discussed below) between the ages of three and six, given that Chinuch does not Halachically begin until the age of six anyway.]
When a child is six years of age and older, the tallis katan should be an amah wide and an amah long. The measurement of the amah may include the front and back together but not the hole. For Children – If each shoulder section is at least 3 etzbaos wide (total of 6 etzbaos), one may include the hole too. Another leniency for children is, that one may rely on the lenient measurement of amah, which is 46cm. For the three etzbaos, one may follow the measurement of 5.76cm.
Once a child reaches Bar Mitzvah:
There needs to be an amah width, an amah length in front, and another amah length in back. One should ensure it’s at least 48cm. Best to add extra as often the tallis katan folds and the folds are not included in the shiur.
I haven’t found a reasonable explanation why people are not careful in this matter for children, at least from six and up. Some suggest a leniency that the amah width may also be comprised of both front and back together. This is unlikely.
The commercially available tzitzis are also not produced this way, making it difficult for children. The ones that are of a minimum shiur in the width are much longer than needed and the hole is usually too large causing it to fall and not sit properly. Of course, these can be made at home or one can shorten the size of the commercially available taleisim ktanim by sewing up the extra material.
An alternative option is to put on size 20 tzitzis on the child to make the Brocho and the rest of the day to wear kids size. The child should wear it for at least three seconds.
Counting the hole:
The Alter Rebbe writes in the Siddur that the hole of the neck does not count for the required size. Based on this – the “shoulders” can not count, because the hole separates them (by children we can be lenient if the shoulder is 3 etzbaos as explained earlier).","###question

Drinking hot water on Motzei Shabbos is not an obligation but rather has a special healing effect.

You should go back to the beginning after the opening words “Baruch Ato etc. Melech Haloam” and mention both categories of food.

Therefore, he should either take another cup of wine and recite a bracha acharona or have someone else who drank wine make the bracha for him.

" Is Mindfulness Meditation Kosher?
Is mindfulness halachically acceptable even though some say it came from Buddhism many years ago?","
It really depends on what you mean when you’re saying mindfulness. The concept of mindfulness is rooted in Torah. However, the implementation of the principles and discipline of mindfulness can vary so much, depending on who, what and how.
Please tell us what specifically you have in mind.
Question clarified:
It’s hard to describe but basically what you do is you just sit on the couch and you just try as much as possible with your eyes closed to feel present and to let yourself only focus on the different things that you are currently feeling, like feeling yourself seeping into the couch, feeling your arms relaxed, feeling the breathing that you’re doing. In general, just feeling what you’re feeling and letting all thoughts, worries that come into your head, letting them fly by, and just noticing them as if you’re just a spectator. I hope I’m explaining it OK. But I just know that different professionals claimed that they got this from buddha kind of thing I wasn’t sure if this is halachically ok.
Answer:
Though the very description described does not seem to be an issue, still, this approach to meditation does not align very well with the Torah approach. Meditations that appear in Jewish literature concentrate on focusing your mind on a specific topic which can arouse you to a higher level of serving Hashem. Judaism is mind-oriented, where proper thoughts influence emotions. This is in stark contrast to this approach where one is encouraged to keep their mind clear and unoccupied.
From a Torah perspective, an empty mind is a black hole, or in the worst-case scenario, it could become a vacuum to draw in destructive thoughts. To quote Hayom Yom, 16 Cheshvan:
Thought is a garment and servant of the intellect and emotions. Even when it is not serving the intellect or emotions, it continues to function, thinking and meditating. However, this activity is then not only devoid of content, but also open to depravement… It is explained that alien or evil thoughts are caused by “emptiness of the head.” For when the mind is occupied, the thought has something to serve, and there is no room for stupid and vain thoughts devoid of substance.
An additional, but fundamental, point to consider: while the actual behavior described below is not against halacha, Mindfulness as a movement and taught by instructors who are sourcing it from buddhism, would make it problematic, see here:
There is a women’s group who do yoga. It is an exercise/workout class with an instructor, and may not be Jewish. A friend mentioned that yoga may be an issue regarding Avodah Zara. Is there a problem to attend?  
I suggest you source your information on mindfulness or meditation from Jewish sources. For example, a good way to start (in English): Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan’s books “Jewish Meditation“, “Meditation and the Bible“.

" Can I eat meat prepared with Worcester’s sauce that contains anchovy paste (fish)?

My question is if it’s possibly batel be’shishim becasue it was a big piece of meat to 3 tbsp Worcester’s sauce.","
If it is kosher certified and it is not labeled as fish, then you may use the beef after the fact, since the fish is nullified in the sauce. (The sauce itself would thus be considered to be non-fish. If the sauce itself however is labeled as fish, then we would need to know the amount of fish proportionate to the meat. This isn’t an easy science to work out.)
L’chatchillah, since there is an argument amongst the poskim if bitul applies to things that are prohibited due to a Sakkana, therefore one should be machmir and not use this sauce in the meat.

Strictly speaking, it is permitted to have a snack and drink while wearing Tefillin and there is no need to remove them. This includes mezonos up to a kebeitza and all non Mezonos foods (any amount). Alcoholic beverages may be drunk if less than the size of kebeitzah.

This is especially true regarding saying Lechaim, even a small amount, which can commonly lead to lightheadedness.
One may speak in Tefillin as long as they do not divert their mind from the Tefillin.

 What is the correct way to take the three steps at the end of Shmone Esrei?,"Question 1: Regarding the three steps after Shmoneh Esrei, are they meant to be three steps, as the finishing step which makes the feet next to each other, or is it three and a fourth step to make the feet equal?
Answer 1: The common custom – and this was the Rebbe’s practice too – is to take three steps after Shemone Esrai as follows: the first step is with the left foot placed behind the right foot, then a large step with the right foot behind the left foot and then another large step with the left foot behind the right foot. After these three steps, the right foot is adjusted to be parallel to the left foot.
This applies only after Shemone Esrei.
Question 2: Regarding the steps before Shmoneh Esrei – the third step has to be the one to make one foot parallel the other? or I am able to take another step?
Answer 2: You may take another step but it’s not required. There is no need to make the feet parallel to each other when moving back before Shemone Esrei.
Question 3: What about for when going forward at the beginning and at the end of Shmone Esre?
Answer 3: One can follow this order:
move the right foot to the front of the left foot [this is applicable only after Shmone Esre, as explained in the link sent]
move the left foot to the front of the right foot
move the right foot to the front of the left foot
align the left foot to be parallel with the right foot

There are a few points to have in mind when turning a pergola into a Sukkah:
1) Material of the support for the S’chach:
From the picture it looks like it will be wooden beams – that is totally fine and the S’chach may lie directly on them. Otherwise, if it’s something which is not Kosher for S’chach, such as made of a material which is susceptible to Tum׳ah (e.g., metal), the S’chach should (lechatchila) be supported by wooden slats or the like.
2) Width of the beams vs. the space between them:
The width of the space between beams (where the S’chach will be visible from inside the Sukkah) must be at least as wide as the beams themselves. Again, from the picture it appears that this is not an issue at all.
3) Space between the beams:
There is a Chumra that the crossbeams should be at least 3 Tefachim (24cm) apart from each other. But this is not the halacha. See details here:

If the individual is on his way up, becoming closer and closer to Yiddishkeit, and it’s believed that by giving him an aliya it could cement his relationship with Torah and Mitzvos, one should consider carefully the correct approach by discussing this with a rav."

"I flew from NY to California this morning and said Tefilas Haderech with “vesachazireinu leshalom”. Now that I’m heading back on the same day but after Shkiah (my flight is 10:30 pm), do I need to make another Tefilas Haderech, or am I covered from the one I made this morning when I mentioned returning?","
You do not say it again.
Explanation:
The “cutoff” for the requirement to say Tefilas Haderech again (whether one said the words “vesachazireinu leshalom” or not) is morning (– following the same rules as Birchas Hatorah, that it is recited every morning).
This applies even if one didn’t sleep the entire night – as soon as alos comes (and one is still traveling), a new Tefilas Haderech should be recited.
If night fell and one slept a “fixed” sleep by night, a new Tefilas Haderech is recited (even before morning).

It depends on what type of vegetable it is (see below).

It would not be permissible to put them out after the 50 minutes and then relight them. Strictly speaking, one may extinguish the candles then, though some are stringent.

How to use a toilet which flushes by a sensor?,"Where no other bathroom is available, you may use an auto-flush toilet by activating the sensor in an irregular manner, for example walking away on your heels or sides of the feet in an uncomfortable manner. Ideally, you should first place a tissue or paper towel over the sensor, in a manner that it will eventually fall off later by itself, so that the toilet won’t flush immediately when you leave the toilet.
How to use water from a faucet which is operated only by sensor?
You should use a bottle of water or another cleanser.
Where this is not possible: After using the bathroom, you may satisfy with rubbing your hands with a cloth or other material, unless you’re planning on davening thereafter, in which case you may ask a non-Jew to fill up a cup of water for you. If however, you want to wash your hands before davening but you did not use the bathroom or touch parts of the body that are usually covered, you should just rub your hands. For washing before bread or upon awakening in the morning, you may also ask a non-Jew to fill up water for you.

"We would like to invite a family for the Shabbos day meal. However, they have a 15-year-old son and 2 daughters ages 11 and 8. We have a 13 y.o. son and a 14 y.o. daughter. Would it be acceptable to host this family for the meal –are they boys/girls of the two families too close in age to be at the same table?","
While technically it’s not forbidden to host single bachurim and girls at the same meal, this is considered inappropriate. One should go to great lengths to arrange their hosting of meals in such a way that bachurim and girls aren’t invited at the same time. Rumor has it that the Rebbe instructed that Yeshivos not allow bachurim to eat out at families who have girls home, even if they are little girls.
The general age for when to separate kids is when they start maturing to understand the concept of separation between men and women. This is generally between the ages of 6 and 9. Children of 9 years and older, must be educated not to mingle and should be seated separately.
Where circumstances require such an arrangement, they should be seated at different tables.

"Do we still hold by this as a practical thing to do nowadays, and if so does that also include the half-day fasts that he mentions?
The Alter Rebbe distinguishes between the extra fasts, in accordance with the number of times the sin was done total, and the actual fasts totaling the number corresponding to the particular sin.
Although he goes into the whole thing about “only a healthy person etc.”, that was in regards to what he said about the Mekubalim who say to do 3 times the total, then he says to redeem them in tzedakah.
But then he says to complete the total amount at least once in one’s life, to push it off to the short winter days, and for the other number (totaling 3 times the standard amount) to do half-day fasting, and then to be stringent according to the other opinion, to redeem all of the extra ones (that add up to the total multiplied by each time) with tzedakah.
Do we still follow this “baal nefesh” thing nowadays?","
Nowadays, personal fasts are not recommended.
The Alter Rebbe writes in the third chapter of Igeret HaTeshuvah that fasting – with the exception of mandatory public fast days – must never come at the expense of one’s health or strength. If fasting will weaken you to the extent that you will not be able to serve G‑d that day with the same energy and vigor as you would have had you eaten—don’t. In fact, the Talmud is very clear about this: One who fasts despite the fact that it weakens him, is called a sinner.
In today’s day and age, when most of us are used to eating three round meals a day, there is almost no one who can claim to be unaffected by fasting.
More importantly, it is the spirit of repentance, the true repentance, that comes along with fasting that counts.
Rather, instead of fasting one should do as the Alter Rebbe brings from the words of Daniel, when advising Nebuchadnezzar: “Redeem your sins with charity, and your wrongdoing by being kind to the needy”. This can be done by donating to a charitable cause the monetary value of the food you eat on a given day.
The Rebbe explains that our generation is even weaker than the Alter Rebbe’s time and accomplishes even these fasts that he permits through tzedaka.","###question

 Is it permissible to pay for non-Jewish workers to eat Treif in a Jewish-owned Halal store?,"
It’s allowed. This applies only if the food never enters your ownership and you do not touch the food, rather you are just paying them for it. The payment can be made in either of the following methods:
You could tell them “Here’s money and buy yourself food”, as long as you don’t specify what the food is.
You can tell the storekeeper give them food and I will pay you.
However, you may not give money to the storekeeper in advance so they should be able to buy there.
If the items you’re buying do not contain food which is assur b’hana’ah (forbidden to benefit from), such as beef, lamb, or goat meat and dairy mixed together while hot, for instance a beef hamburger with cheese, or pizza with pepperoni, you may even give money to the storekeeper in advance.
Some allow in this case – where it’s not assur b’hana’ah – even buying the food outright if it’s to feed your workers, but not to give as a gift (unless it’s food which only forbidden rabbinically). It’s advisable to be stringent not to buy forbidden food to feed workers, even if it’s not assur b’hana’ah, unless it’s food which only forbidden rabbinically.

" Can a Jew work in a non-Kosher liquor store?
Would there be any Halachic problem for a Torah observant Jew to work in a non kosher liquor store that services Jewish (including many not yet frum) clientele?","
In regards to serving a Jew these type of beverages, there might be room for leniency depending on the circumstances. If however it involves pouring the client a ‘non kosher’ beverage on the spot for him to taste or drink, it may not be done.

I’m kind of new in the community and there are people who walk out of the room with their face to the Aron and back to the door. I had someone tell me it’s unnecessary. Do I need to stop this chumra? Or is this one of those things where I shouldn’t listen to people laughing about the situation?,"
It is not halachically required but it’s appropriate to be stringent. This stringency only applies if your back is directly facing the Aron. It also only applies when leaving the shul, not when moving within the shul. If one wishes to be stringent even when moving around, it should only be done when directly in the line of the Aron and only within 4 Amos of it.
Regardless, you certainly shouldn’t do something which stands out and appears strange.","###question

" How can I practice Shechita without violating Bal Tashchis?
When learning shechita, shochtim must learn to hold and properly shecht the animal or bird. The first few cannot be eaten due to kashrus issues. Is it Mutar to practice with the intent of throwing out the birds? If it is Mutar, is there a limit how many birds may be used for practice?","
It is asur to make a bird a Neveila and certainly not with the intention of throwing it out, as it is Bal Tashchis, destroying something which is useful. An exception would be if a Neveila is worth the same as a kosher bird.

"I struggle with intrusive thoughts that are negative (to say the least) and become so anxious and worried about how they may affect people and reality-especially when wishing them something not good-when Chas veShalom I would never EVER want that. In general, what are the implications/bearing of the effects of our thoughts? To what extent does thought affect things? In the end of the day everything is up to Hashem no? On one hand we’re told to think good because this can affect the outcome of things and on the other hand we’re told to dismiss thoughts and have hesech hadaas.

This has happened quite a few times.

First and foremost it is most important that you abide by the guidelines your therapist is giving you. Indeed it is a mitzvah in the Torah to look after our health – mental and emotional health is included as well, if not even more important.
It is true that negative thoughts can cause negative effects. However, this only applies for one who chooses to have negative thoughts. If these thoughts come to you against your will, as you have stated clearly that these are things that you don’t want to happen, they are harmless and should simply be ignored.
Dwelling on the these thoughts does no good for anyone. Usually, a good idea during such times is to to focus to other important pursuits, whether Torah study or even mundane things lhavdil, which require your focus and attention. I trust that your therapist will be able to help you in these matters.
Everybody has their unique challenge which has been given to them from above, as a means to improve themselves. This is not something that should put us off. On the contrary, this indicates the great trust that Hashem has in this individual that he can succeed under the circumstances.  The greater the challenge, the greater the person’s neshoma is and this indicates that there are more kochos this person receives from on High to deal with it.
The Torah advice is to take things step-by-step, not allowing us to become anxious about the fact that we haven’t yet reached our goal. This is a lifelong mission to achieve our purpose in this world and it should be done b’simcha.
Wishing you all well, especially and being able to accomplish these goals in a healthy manner.","###question

Once the Torah is moved out if this dresser, its timely Kedushah leaves and does not need genizah.
A dresser or a closet etc. that was built for ordinary purposes and now is being used to put there a Sefer Torah just for the time being is considered to have only the status of Tashmishei Kedushah when it is being used for the Sefer Torah. Afterwards, it reverts back to the status of an ordinary closet."

I have been having nightmares recently about cadavers and about dead people in general. what halachic guidance is there for medical professionals dealing with these cadaver labs? Are there any segulos or things we can do for ourselves and for the honor of the dead (whatever nefesh remain by the body)? as far as I know they are all non-Jews.,"
You mentioned that you are fairly certain that the body is Non-Jewish. Therefore, we will answer accordingly. However, it is important to note that some schools do in fact use Jewish cadavers (though not often). So, if possible, it may be a good idea to ask about the history of your cadaver. If not possible, you can work under the assumption that the body you are working on is in fact not Jewish (outside of Israel obviously).
In respect to your question, a non-Jewish cadaver donated to science for the purpose of medical education is okay to be studied on. This is because it is for the sake of medicine and the potential of finding cures for life threatening conditions.
That said, when you are in the anatomy lab working on a cadaver you should always keep in mind that the Tzelem Elokim applies to all humans and therefore work respectfully on the body. This includes not talking divrei chol, not joking around the body (as many students unfortunately do), and overall respect for the person who graciously donated their body for your education.
There are a number of organizations that may assist you with these challenges and others as you continue your medical career. One that comes to mind is an organization recently founded by frum medical students called the Jewish Physicians Network

Regardless, he may snack on non-mezonos foods and eat mezonos food up to a Kebeitza.
There is still a reason not to eat anything at all before the Bris as the Chassidim Harishonim would refrain from eating or drinking even the smallest quantities before performing a Mitzvah Chavivah such as Lulav, and certainly this would apply to Bris Milah.

 Are you not supposed to eat before a Bris and Pidyon Haben, like we don’t eat before doing any mitzvah like Tekios or Megilah?.
 ###answer 
 
Some write that the father may not eat before the Bris, just like one may not eat before any Mitzva that has a time limit, like Mincha, Maariv, and Bedikas Chometz.
However, there is reason to be lenient when the father appointed the Mohel to fulfill the Mitzvah for him.
Regardless, he may snack on non-mezonos foods and eat mezonos food up to a Kebeitza.
There is still a reason not to eat anything at all before the Bris as the Chassidim Harishonim would refrain from eating or drinking even the smallest quantities before performing a Mitzvah Chavivah such as Lulav, and certainly this would apply to Bris Milah. The custom however is to be lenient about this. Certainly one may be lenient about drinking.
All of the above would also apply equally to a Pidyon Haben, although there is more room for leniency regarding snacking, and so is the common custom, especially if it takes place in the afternoon.

In general, you should not use a non-frum Yid to take Challa.
In this case, you should bake one new challah, put all the Challos together, cover them, and take Challah from the new challah for all the challos. If for whatever reason this was not done, you should leave a piece over from each challah.","###question

" How can I leave a long & boring meal?

You can have in mind in the beginning that you are not establishing a meal with them and thus not get yourself into the issue altogether. You can also begin the meal elsewhere or even there but before them by eating a kezayis before them.
However, if you ate together with them you must wait until they make a Zimun. If you are the only one who wants to bentch, they do not need to stop and make a Zimun with you, but they may choose to. When making a zimun with ten men, Elokeinu is said even if not all of them are bentching now.
If staying on will cause you to miss out on learning or doing any other mitzvah which you won’t be able to make up later, you may make a zimun with three out of the ten men.","###question

If the corks are fastened in the wine bottles in a way that if opened by someone it would be very hard or impossible to put it back to look as it was (as in most cases with wine bottles), then it would be considered a seal even if there is no Hashgacha printed on it.
Even if not, there is a debate amongst the poskim if wine nowadays needs two seals (like it says in Shulchan Aruch) or one seal would be enough.
Thus, if the wine is Mevushal then the cork is sufficient according to all. If it is not Mevushal, then according to some opinions there should be a second seal, for example (like a lot of wines have) a piece of plastic that covers the cap/cork and top of bottle tight in a way that once opened it can’t be returned.
(Even even if it only has a cork, if the company’s name is printed on it, one may rely on the lenient poskim when the company only produces kosher wine. However, a company that produces non-kosher wine but also has a kosher run, would need to have the actual hashgocho printed on it.)

 When should one eat Matzah on Pesach Sheni?,"The main custom is to eat Matza during a meal of the daytime, on the 14th of Iyar. (This year, since it’s Erev Shabbos, one should make sure to begin such meal before the 10th Halachic hour of the day).
In some places, however, the Rebbe cites the Minhag also in regards to the night of the 15th (the time when the Korban was eaten in the times of the Beis Hamikdash).
It’s recorded in some places that the Rebbe ate the Matzah on the day of the 14th or – sometimes and – on the night of the 15th. (There were a few exceptions, such as when Pesach Sheini would be on a Taanis Behab, or when the Rebbe went to the Ohel).
[To note also that it’s recorded that on Pesach Sheini 5712 – a Friday, and the day after the passing of the Rebbe’s brother, R. Yisroel Aryeh Leib – the Rebbe washed for a meal and ate from the Matzah that was baked on Erev Pesach (even though generally the Rebbe would not wash for a meal on Erev Shabbos).]
Additionally, in the Sicha of Shabbos Parahas Shmini 5740 (not Muga), it’s recorded that the Rebbe mentioned the different customs on this (such as eating on the night/day/afternoon of the 14th), and stated that those who wish to be Mehader (scrupulous) eat on all these 3 occasions, as well as on the days before and after Pesach Sheini.

" How does one take the steps back and bow at the end of Shmoneh Esrei?
How does the Alter Rebbe say and how did the Rebbe do it? Is a lefty different? And do you step forward at the end?","
After finishing reciting Shemoneh Esreh, it is important to take three steps back, just as one would when leaving the presence of a king, and then say farewell. Neglecting to do this is the same as not reciting Shemoneh Esreh at all.
It’s important not to incline your head while stepping back; instead, bow first and take the three steps in one bow. While still bowed, bid farewell to your left and right before straightening up.
You should begin by inclining your head to the left, which is to the right of the Shchina that is before you as you leave your place of prayer. Then, incline your head to the right, which is to the left of the Divine Presence.
This means that when you say “Oseh shalom bimromav,” you should incline your head to the left, and when you say “Hu yaaseh shalom aleinu,” you should incline your head to the right. This is how it is brought in Shulchan Aruch.
In Sefer Haminhagim, however, the order is as follows: When you say “Oseh shalom bimromav,” you should incline your head to the left, when you say “Hu” hold your head in the center, when you say “Hu yaaseh shalom aleinu,” you should incline your head to the right, and when you say “Val . . amen” hold your head in the center.
The Rebbe would do as follows: “Oseh” to the left, “Shalom” to the right, “bimromav” in the center, lift his head and say “Hu . . amen”.
The lefty would bow in the same order.

"Also I know the Torah doesn’t accept 2 men as a marriage, so what’s the difference between a couple who can’t conceive and a gay couple?","
The distinction is rooted in the traditional understanding of the purpose of sexual relations within marriage. According to Torah, procreation is considered one of the primary purposes of sexual intimacy. While a heterosexual couple unable to conceive naturally can still engage in sexual relations to strengthen their bond, they are seen as engaging in an act with the potential for procreation, even if it does not result in pregnancy. (This also explains why even for a heterosexual couple there are still laws that prohibit certain types of sexual intimacy).
Additionally, every time there is relations within marriage it creates Neshamos above and brings sanctity into this world. Indeed, we are taught that the souls of converts emanate from such relations. Likewise, these souls will eventually descend into bodies in the days of Moshiach. This can be compared to planting, where the harvesting takes place later, in higher worlds or even down here below.
In the case of a same-gender couple, their sexual relations are considered as deviating from the natural design for procreation. Indeed, sexual acts outside the context of heterosexual marriage are associated with transgressions. This can be compared to spilling seed without any planting whatsoever.
It is also important to note that Jewish teachings emphasize the complementarity of male and female in the context of marriage. This perspective highlights the belief that the coming together of male and female is seen as a necessary element in fulfilling the divine purpose of creation and the continuation of the human family, as well as causing the unity of masculine and feminine forces in the universe.","###question

" Is an oven with Sabbath Mode permitted on Yom Tov for cooking?
Hi,
My electric oven has an “Adjusting the Temperature” part of the Shabbos Mode, where you can push buttons to change the temperature.
“1. Press Bake, use the 1 through 5 number pads and the Timer pad to select a different preset cooking temperature, and press Start.
2. Since no feedback is given during temperature change, an oven thermometer can be used to confirm temperature changes.”
Is it permitted on Yom Tov for cooking?
The use case would be to have the oven on 200 at the start of Yom Tov to keep food warm, but then the next day, to change the temperature to 350 to allow for proper cooking.
I saw on the Star-K website that it’s okay. I wanted to know if this is fine lichatcila.
“Some Sabbath Mode ovens are designed to work on a delay when in Sabbath Mode, the display will not change. In addition, this feature permits raising the temperature on Yom Tov at any time, regardless of when power is flowing to the oven. This is because when one adjusts the dial or keypad, it is not directly causing the temperature of the oven to change. Therefore, this action is considered a grama, an indirect action, which will cause the temperature to be raised. Even with these types of ovens, it is better to lower the temperature only when necessary for food preparation or enjoyment of the Yom Tov. (Other features of Sabbath mode ovens are discussed further in this article.)”
Thank you.","
First, a general note of caution that some appliance manufacturers have been known to design “Shabbos Mode” models according to their own understanding of the requirements, which can be deficient. Therefore, the “Adjusting the Temperature” feature you describe may not actually involve the timed delay described in your quote from the Star-K advice, in which case it would not be allowed even according to the Star-K position. As such, further investigation would be necessary to establish how the oven works.
However, the main issue here is that the Star-K advice is based on a lenient view that:
1.       An action of Grama (indirect), even if intended and desired, is permissible with regards to Havarah (igniting) and Kibui (extinguishing) on Yom Tov.
2.       That a delay of 15-25 seconds (or more) is considered grama even though it is bound to result from the internal computer process triggered by pressing the button.
Many Poskim reject this permissive approach for many reasons. Notably, for those who follow the rulings of the Alter Rebbe, an act of Grama is not routinely permitted on Yom Tov, and one should therefore not rely on this leniency.","###question

This is only permitted under certain conditions such as ltzorech mitzvah, ltzorech gadol, etc.
However, it came to my attention that since she is a schir yom, this is forbidden based on the Alter Rebbe 244,12. Is it true that any shvus dshvus is not allowed by a schir yom?.
 ###answer 
 
This is incorrect. Under the conditions that are permitted, it’s acceptable even with a schir yom."

" Is a woman obligated in Melava Malka? Will she have Techiyas Hameisim if she doesn’t?
Regarding the Luz bone needed for Techiyas Hameisim, it is known that eating Melava Malka only by washing for bread will one be zoche for Techiyas Hameisim. Is this strictly for men, or also for women? How much bread? and I was told also a hot drink.
What exactly is the amount you need to eat, and does it apply to women and children? If one does not wash, does it mean one won’t be zoche for Techiyas Hameisim?","
There is a debate whether women are obligated in Melava Malka. According to most authorities they should observe it. Indeed, it considered a segulah for women for easy birth. Likewise, children should be trained in this important mitzvah too.
The luz bone reason applies to women too. However, understandably, one should observe these laws independent of the techiyas hameisim aspect.
Similarly, it would seem that even if someone follows the position of fulfilling this mitzvah through cake or fruit, they will merit the Resurrection. But again, one should observe these laws properly, regardless of this aspect.
Ideally, one is to wash and eat at least a kezayis of bread. It is recommended also to eat hot food or drink.
On the other hand, it isn’t accurate to say the reverse that if one does not eat Melava Malka they will not have techiyas hameisim.","###question
