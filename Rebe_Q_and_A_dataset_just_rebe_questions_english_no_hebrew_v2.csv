" May I put a frozen bag of vegetables etc. on my body on Shabbos as it might melt from my body heat?
If the answer is yes, may I cool myself off with these packets of frozen milk knowing and benefiting from the fact that they will melt? If neither of these are acceptable,may I use a cold cloth placed in the freezer?","
1) One may handle ice packs to cool off with, since only a small amount of water is melted, there is no intention of melting them and the melted water is going to waste. Melting ice is problematic when one actively melts it, or even when no action is taken if this his intention, for example if wants to melt it save the melted water – which is not applicable in this case.
However, frozen food items like meat and vegetables should not be used since they are muktzah.
2) Since you want to melt the milk, you should not purposely use it to cool off so as to proactively melt it.
3) Cold towels that are not wet and will not become squeezed is permissible to use.","###question

" Can I get a heter to be intimate with my husband during the day?
Hi, I am nine months pregnant and too tired most of the time to be intimate at night. Can I get a heter to be intimate with my husband during the day?","
According to halacha, relations must be at night or even after break of dawn until it’s light enough where people can recognize each other (misheyakir), the time when one may put on tefillin, provided it’s dark. This affects also the mazal as well as the neshama of the child born from these relations.
Ideally, you should attempt to do the same, but where this proves very difficult, and particularly in your case of pregnancy where it’s not for the purpose of conception, there is room for leniency. However, you should ensure that the room is completely dark, or at least cover yourself completely with a blanket that no light enters. If possible, one should schedule relations for Shabbos day.","###question

 Does one need to ask a Rav before being induced? Is there any Halachic issue?,"
This matter is discussed in a number of Poskim. The general rule is that one may not induce or rush the onset of labor unless there are clear medical reasons to require it. Some of the reasons for this prohibition are because:
There is a level of risk inherent to childbirth, and one should therefore not hasten it even though it is bound to come.
The special assurance of protection Hashem provides at the time of childbirth does not necessarily apply to the same degree if the birth is hastened without a clear medical need.
The procedures and/or medicines involved in induction can themselves cause complications, and one should not take that risk needlessly.","###question

Our son was born on 19 Iyar. This year Erev Shavuos is on Shabbos. When should we make the Upshernish – on Friday 4 of Sivan or Tuesday Isru Chag?,"
• Generally:
For a child whose birthday is from after Lag Baomer until Erev Shavuos, the Upshernish haircut should take place on Erev Shavuos. [When Erev Shavuos falls on Shabbos – on 4 Sivan (with the exception of someone whose birthday is on Erev Shavuos, in which case it should be postponed until after Shavuos)].

• However, regarding someone whose birthday is on 19 Iyar, a day after Lag Baomer:
There are instructions from the Rebbe to perform the haircut on Lag Baomer.
While in most places it appears that it should take place on Lag Baomer itself (during the day), a day before the child turns 3, others record that it should be done on the actual birthday, right after nightfall on the night after Lag Baomer.
See here the testimony of three people who were all instructed by the Rebbe to do it on Lag Baomer: R. SB Popak, R. YY Hecht and R. Refoel Hartman. In the case of R. Hecht, the Rebbe himself did the cutting. (This information has been independently verified by us). In the case of R. Hartman, we have the actual answer of the Rebbe.
Independent of the above, there is yet another directive presented regarding the Upshernish of Ari Halberstam hy”d (whose birthday is on 19 Iyar), of which there are pictures of the Rebbe cutting the hair. See in the Hebrew references below.

 Is an oven with Cook-time or Stop-time Mode acceptable for Shabbos use?,"There are many ovens on the market, and it is impossible in this short space to investigate and address every single model. The best we can do is provide a summary of the many issues to look out for. It is important that you read through the manuals of any model you are considering for purchase, in order to determine whether, and to what degree, the issues outlined below apply.
Thermostat:
The main problem with using a oven on Shabbos is the thermostat, which is affected by opening or closing the oven while the oven is on. When the oven door is opened, the thermostat will detect the cold air that rushes in and will activate the heating element if it is off at that moment. It is forbidden to cause this to occur, even if all the food will be removed all at once before the oven door is re-closed. [If the oven door is re-closed with some of the food remaining inside, there may be additional concerns of Bishul on Shabbos, depending on the circumstances.]  The thermostat is not a concern for Yom Tov use, but there are additional problems with a oven on Yom Tov as detailed below.
If the oven is off, like after the cook-time or stop time has finished this would not be an issue.
the problem with using such an oven on Yom Tov is primarily a practical one; most modern ovens have an auto shut-off feature that turns the oven off after around 6-12 hours. Yet another problem, applicable on both Shabbos and Yom Tov, is that many models have lights or fans that are activated and deactivated as the door is opened or closed. In summary, a modern oven without Sabbath Mode may be completely unusable on Shabbos and Yom Tov.
Ovens with “Sabbath Mode”:
Buying an oven with Sabbath Mode will alleviate many of these problems. Sabbath Mode will generally disable the oven’s display panel and any electronic controls, as well as disengage the fans and lights from being activated by opening and closing the oven door. The Sabbath Mode feature will also disable the auto shut-off feature. However, one very big problem, at least with regards to most models, is that the thermostat usually remains operative. [Some ovens have a light which illuminates when the heating element is on, in which case the oven could theoretically be opened when the light is on. However, it has been demonstrated through rigorous testing that these indicator lights are generally inaccurate, and may be illuminated even when the heating element is off.]
The thermostat does not present a problem for Yom Tov use, but makes it completely forbidden on Shabbos, according to most opinions. The outcome is that, ironically, the Sabbath Mode oven remains forbidden for Shabbos use, and is permitted only on Yom Tov. Perhaps it would have been more apt to name this feature “Yom Tov Mode”.
There is a practical workaround for Shabbos use that is easy and simple: Estimate about what time the main course will be served, and make sure that the oven turns off before then. This is generally easy to achieve, as the Sabbath Mode feature can usually be set to turn the oven off in any increment amount of time up until 72 or 96 hours. So, you can easily set the oven to go off after 2 or 3 hours, for example. Once the oven is off, opening the door does not create a problem with regards to the thermostat.
However, this method will usually create a new problem, which requires its own workaround. Now that the oven is off, this means that Sabbath Mode is now deactivated as well, and opening the door will turn the light on (if the oven has a light). This can be circumvented before Shabbos by manipulating the magnets or levers that detect whether the door is open. The specific manner of circumvention will vary from model to model, and in the case of magnetic detectors, may take some trial-and-error. Some oven doors are designed to be taken apart to allow proper cleaning of all the glass panes, and the magnet can be physically removed from the door. In other models, it may work to place a strong and thin magnet on the oven wall at the correct place.(The location of the oven’s magnet can usually be detected by sliding a paperclip around the top of the oven door.) These options may or may not work, depending on the model, so you would have to try before Shabbos, when you have the time and patience to troubleshoot it. [Note: Disabling the magnetic sensor only helps with regards to the functions controlled by the door sensor, such as the oven light and fans. However, the thermostat is not controlled by the door sensor, which is why the oven needs to be off before opening the door on Shabbos.]
Following the advice above, when Shabbos is followed by Yom Tov, one would have to choose whether to reserve the oven’s use for Shabbos or Yom Tov, as using it on Shabbos would require the oven to be set to turn off on Shabbos, in which case it will remain off for the duration of Yom Tov as well.
The Issur of Sheiyah with regards to an oven:
The above answer focuses purely on using the oven itself. However, there are also restrictions about which foods may be placed in an oven before Shabbos without a Blech, and much discussion about whether, and how, a Blech can be facilitated in an oven. Here is a brief summary of the issues:
From the Torah perspective, one may place food over an open flame before Shabbos in order that it cooks on Shabbos. Nevertheless, Chazal forbade this due to the concern that a person may come to stoke the fire on Shabbos in order to speed up the cooking process. This prohibition is knownas Shehiya.
One method of avoiding Shehiya is to cover the flames, typically with a Blech. Covering the fire indicates that one does not desire a strong flame, it diverts his attention from the fire, and it serves as a reminder not to increase the flames. With regards to an oven, there is a dispute whether – and how – a Blech can be adequately created. In practice, a Blech in an oven should be situated so that it covers the heating elements, which may be located either at the top of the oven, the bottom or the backwall. In many ovens, there are heating elements in all of these places.
Another way of addressing Shehiya, and to sidestep the need for a Blech, is to ensure that the food is cooked prior to Shabbos. It is sufficient if the food is already half cooked.  This fraction does not represent time, but rather, is qualitative and measured against the degree of cooking most people would regard as fully cooked. Nevertheless, for a number of reasons, it is best that the food be fully baked before Shabbos.
There is yet a third possible way to circumvent the prohibition of Shehiya. Chazal allowed one to put completely raw meat on an open flame just before the onset of Shabbos. They were not concerned that one might come to stoke the flames, because doing so would not serve any productive purpose – it would not ready the meat in time for the Friday night meal, nor would it be necessary to ready the meat in time for the Shabbos day meal. This leniency is known as “Kidra Chaysa” – literally: raw pot. (Indeed, some people may wish to put raw chicken and rice right before Shabbos to slow bake in the oven for the daytime Seudas Shabbos.)
In order for this leniency to apply, two criteria must be met. First, the food item must be one that takes a relatively long time to cook properly (such as meat). Second, the food must be put on the fire just before Shabbos, late enough that it will not begin cooking before Shabbos comes in. Some contemporary Poskim therefore assert that this leniency seldom applies nowadays, because most modern cooking appliances are able to cook in a relatively short amount of time. As a case in point, meat put up to cook rightat the  onset of Shabbos would usually be fit for consumption by the time the meat course  arrives. Even if the heat is set to low, this does not diminish the oven’s overall ability to bake quickly, because the seat heating can be easily raised. Thus, according to these Poskim, this option is not applicable to a modern oven.
Other associated issues:
1. It should be pointed out that even when the oven is off and cold, if it will be turned on with a Shabbos clock or a timer (see next point), one may not place inside any food which is not completely cooked. Furthermore, even completely cooked food that has cooled down may not be placed inside either, unless the food is completely dry (and will remain dry when heated). The same applies to an oven which will remain off but has  not yet cooled down.
2. With regards to Shabbos clocks in general, the Rebbe writes in a letter (Igros Kodesh Vol 12 page 192): “There are those who are extremely stringent and are even sceptical about the permissibility of using a Shabbos clock… Therefore, I am abstaining from giving this idea in an official capacity.” Even so, it is reported that the Rebbe instructed some individuals that they may be used (See Shulchan Menachem Volume 2 page 173).  At the same time, many authorities who permit Shabbos clocks in general nevertheless rule that they should not be used with regards to cooking specifically, for a number of reasons.

This is generally easy to achieve, as the Sabbath Mode feature can usually be set to turn the oven off in any increment amount of time up until 72 or 96 hours. So, you can easily set the oven to go off after 2 or 3 hours, for example. Once the oven is off, opening the door does not create a problem with regards to the thermostat.
However, this method will usually create a new problem, which requires its own workaround. Now that the oven is off, this means that Sabbath Mode is now deactivated as well, and opening the door will turn the light on (if the oven has a light). This can be circumvented before Shabbos by manipulating the magnets or levers that detect whether the door is open. The specific manner of circumvention will vary from model to model, and in the case of magnetic detectors, may take some trial-and-error. Some oven doors are designed to be taken apart to allow proper cleaning of all the glass panes, and the magnet can be physically removed from the door. In other models, it may work to place a strong and thin magnet on the oven wall at the correct place.(The location of the oven’s magnet can usually be detected by sliding a paperclip around the top of the oven door.) These options may or may not work, depending on the model, so you would have to try before Shabbos, when you have the time and patience to troubleshoot it. [Note: Disabling the magnetic sensor only helps with regards to the functions controlled by the door sensor, such as the oven light and fans. However, the thermostat is not controlled by the door sensor, which is why the oven needs to be off before opening the door on Shabbos.]
Following the advice above, when Shabbos is followed by Yom Tov, one would have to choose whether to reserve the oven’s use for Shabbos or Yom Tov, as using it on Shabbos would require the oven to be set to turn off on Shabbos, in which case it will remain off for the duration of Yom Tov as well.
The Issur of Sheiyah with regards to an oven:
The above answer focuses purely on using the oven itself. However, there are also restrictions about which foods may be placed in an oven before Shabbos without a Blech, and much discussion about whether, and how, a Blech can be facilitated in an oven. Here is a brief summary of the issues:
From the Torah perspective, one may place food over an open flame before Shabbos in order that it cooks on Shabbos. Nevertheless, Chazal forbade this due to the concern that a person may come to stoke the fire on Shabbos in order to speed up the cooking process. This prohibition is knownas Shehiya.
One method of avoiding Shehiya is to cover the flames, typically with a Blech. Covering the fire indicates that one does not desire a strong flame, it diverts his attention from the fire, and it serves as a reminder not to increase the flames. With regards to an oven, there is a dispute whether – and how – a Blech can be adequately created. In practice, a Blech in an oven should be situated so that it covers the heating elements, which may be located either at the top of the oven, the bottom or the backwall. In many ovens, there are heating elements in all of these places.
Another way of addressing Shehiya, and to sidestep the need for a Blech, is to ensure that the food is cooked prior to Shabbos. It is sufficient if the food is already half cooked.  This fraction does not represent time, but rather, is qualitative and measured against the degree of cooking most people would regard as fully cooked. Nevertheless, for a number of reasons, it is best that the food be fully baked before Shabbos.
There is yet a third possible way to circumvent the prohibition of Shehiya. Chazal allowed one to put completely raw meat on an open flame just before the onset of Shabbos. They were not concerned that one might come to stoke the flames, because doing so would not serve any productive purpose – it would not ready the meat in time for the Friday night meal, nor would it be necessary to ready the meat in time for the Shabbos day meal. This leniency is known as “Kidra Chaysa” – literally: raw pot. (Indeed, some people may wish to put raw chicken and rice right before Shabbos to slow bake in the oven for the daytime Seudas Shabbos.)
In order for this leniency to apply, two criteria must be met. First, the food item must be one that takes a relatively long time to cook properly (such as meat). Second, the food must be put on the fire just before Shabbos, late enough that it will not begin cooking before Shabbos comes in. Some contemporary Poskim therefore assert that this leniency seldom applies nowadays, because most modern cooking appliances are able to cook in a relatively short amount of time. As a case in point, meat put up to cook rightat the  onset of Shabbos would usually be fit for consumption by the time the meat course  arrives. Even if the heat is set to low, this does not diminish the oven’s overall ability to bake quickly, because the seat heating can be easily raised. Thus, according to these Poskim, this option is not applicable to a modern oven.
Other associated issues:
1. It should be pointed out that even when the oven is off and cold, if it will be turned on with a Shabbos clock or a timer (see next point), one may not place inside any food which is not completely cooked. Furthermore, even completely cooked food that has cooled down may not be placed inside either, unless the food is completely dry (and will remain dry when heated). The same applies to an oven which will remain off but has  not yet cooled down.
2. With regards to Shabbos clocks in general, the Rebbe writes in a letter (Igros Kodesh Vol 12 page 192): “There are those who are extremely stringent and are even sceptical about the permissibility of using a Shabbos clock… Therefore, I am abstaining from giving this idea in an official capacity.” Even so, it is reported that the Rebbe instructed some individuals that they may be used (See Shulchan Menachem Volume 2 page 173).  At the same time, many authorities who permit Shabbos clocks in general nevertheless rule that they should not be used with regards to cooking specifically, for a number of reasons.

 Am I allowed to eat in a married woman’s kitchen if she does not cover her hair?,"This depends on various factors. Firstly, do you know if she keeps the basic kosher standards that are not necessarily kept by all kosher consumers such as: Cholov Yisrael and Pas Yisrael, etc..?

If so, it could be acceptable to eat in her home if otherwise, her Yiras shamayim seems to be good in all other aspects.
If, however, she has had a frum upbringing and now does not cover her hair, then this is a negative reflection on her yiras shamayim. This is since there is no true justified reason she can have that she is not covering her hair.

" What is the minimum of Challah one can eat and still be able to wash & Bentch?
I try to keep the minhag of melave malka every week, including washing. Sometimes it’s hard to eat a lot after having eaten recently at the Shabbos meal…
What is the minimum of challah/Matzah one can eat and still be able to wash/bentch?
Over the years I’ve seen many different places where there is a weight amount or, worse yet, a description such as “kazayis” or “kabeitza” to describe food shiurim, and those leave a person very confused as to the exact amount of food. Would the Rav be so kind as to describe the size of a piece of challah or the amount of matzah (usually box Square Matzah)? (E.g. The amount of challah comparable to a golf ball or two golf balls etc or a different item that the challah could be measured against).
Additionally, does the shiur consist of only the hamotzi food, or could something that’s put on top of the challah/matzah also count as part of the shiur? (Let’s say if someone puts egg salad or tuna salad on challah, can this be counted and this way one eats let’s of the actual hamotzi food but can nevertheless still wash and bench).
And finally, is there a time frame in which one needs to eat the shiur?","
One must wash (without a Bracha) and make Hamotzi for even the smallest amount.
One must wash with a Bracha if he’s planning on eating a K’beitza. This is approximately 2 K’zeizim. Each K’zayis should be eaten within K’dei Achilas Pras (= 4 minutes) and without pausing between the two of them.
One must make a Birchas Hamazon if he ate a K’zayis of bread within 4 minutes. Other foods do not count for this amount.
If 4 minutes proves to be too difficult, one can be lenient and eat it within 6 minutes but should eat approximately the size of 1/3 of a K’beitza within 4 minutes. If one is not sure if it was eaten in the right amount of time – if he is satiated, he should still make a Birchas Hamazon.
Torah measurements are usually volume-based, not weight. A K’zayis is the approximate volume of half an average size egg. A K’beizah is the volume of an average size egg. Nonetheless, for simplicity, they have been converted to weight measurements, although the weight measurements are far from accurate. This is because different foods with an equal volume weigh differently. The following is the weight for water; bread and certainly matzah weighs less. For a K’beitza this is approx. 53.8 gram or 1.89 oz. For a K’zayis, approx. 25.6 gram or 0.90 oz.
One-third of a standard square machine matza is approximately a K’zayis. With bread, it is harder to measure, as they are not uniform but it is approximately the size of what would fit into a small l’chaim cup. In order to be safe, one should err on the side of caution and eat slightly more than the shiur, due to a number of reasons, among them since some crumbs remain between the teeth.

This matter is discussed in a number of Poskim. The general rule is that one may not induce or rush the onset of labor unless there are clear medical reasons to require it. Some of the reasons for this prohibition are because:
There is a level of risk inherent to childbirth, and one should therefore not hasten it even though it is bound to come.
The special assurance of protection Hashem provides at the time of childbirth does not necessarily apply to the same degree if the birth is hastened without a clear medical need.
The procedures and/or medicines involved in induction can themselves cause complications, and one should not take that risk needlessly.","###question

There is a level of risk inherent to childbirth, and one should therefore not hasten it even though it is bound to come.
The special assurance of protection Hashem provides at the time of childbirth does not necessarily apply to the same degree if the birth is hastened without a clear medical need.
The procedures and/or medicines involved in induction can themselves cause complications, and one should not take that risk needlessly."

Thank you for contacting AskTheRav. We have received your question.
Please note that AskTheRav receives many questions from our visitors every day. We strive to answer these matters of practical Halacha in an efficient manner. Therefore, we ask our visitors to limit their questions to those of practical Halachic nature rather than learning style research questions, so that we can spend our time serving you best with your Halachic questions.
Regarding your question: The Chabad position re Zionism is very nuanced. An excellent summary can be found here, and here.
Regarding the usage of Ivrit, see here 
Regarding taking control of the mountain, Jews have complete control over that area. As for an obligation to build the Beis Hamikdosh on Temple Mount, this is actually one thing where the Rebbe was very clear on this matter.

The takana to learn chitas is on an individual basis, where everyone will finish the Chumash and Tanya throughout the year. And the Tehillim on a monthly basis.
Splitting up the chitas is not the ideal method, since you as an individual will not have completed the above. There is however some merit in it, since you, as part of a group, will have it completed (similar to the division of Shas has done on 19 Kislev, although as noted, this was not the original takana of chitas).

Nails shouldn’t be cut on Wednesday night – like Thursday.
Regarding nights in general –
May I cut my hair and nails after chatzos (midday)?
Sifrei Kabbalah (Holy writings of Kabbalah) relate that the Arizal would refrain from having his hair cut after midday. Some are of the opinion that the same would apply to cutting nails. The question is: what was the reason for this custom?
If it was because we shouldn’t engage in any new melachah (work) once the zman (time) of Mincha has arrived—lest we be distracted from davening Mincha—then we can assume that there is no issue with cutting our hair after having davened Mincha. Nails, however, may be cut even before davening Mincha.
However, if the reason was that according to Kabbalah the forces of dinim (Heavenly judgment) begin gaining strength after midday, it would be cause to refrain from doing so throughout the entire afternoon, and in fact more so at night, when the dinim are even more severe. Although the influence of the forces of dinim is mentioned specifically only regarding haircuts, it can arguably be applied to nail cutting too.
Common practice, though, is that we do take haircuts and cut our nails after midday—provided that we have davened Mincha—and at night as well. Likewise, If one has a fixed minyan for davening Mincha, one need not refrain from engaging in melacha prior to davening.","###question

 Do apricots or honey need a Hechsher?,"Honey:
Raw unflavored honey which is 100% pure and filtered may be used without a Hechsher. However, retail size honey often goes through heating which can be a problem when using shared equipment. It is therefore recommended to purchase honey only with a Hechsher. One must ensure that no other ingredients are added like alcohol and sweeteners. Additionally, the honey needs to be filtered very well from any pieces of the bees that can get mixed in it.
Apricots:
Fresh apricots do not require a Hechsher unless they are from Eretz Yisroel. Even dried apricots, if produced out of Eretz Yisroel (usually they are made in Turkey), do not require a Hechsher, provided they are unflavored, and without additives, since no other ingredients go in the drying process. Sulfur dioxide added is not a concern. However, some apricot companies season their apricots with flavoring to give their apricots a unique taste. Therefore, to be on the safer side it is best to buy only with a Hechsher as food processing is always changing. One must certainly ensure the apricots are insect free. They must be checked appropriately.","###question

" Am I allowed to use the sunroof of a car with Schach on it as a Sukkah when out on a family trip on Chol Hamoed Sukkos?
SimilarQuestion:
Can one make a sukkah by removing T tops and placing a mat on top, into a kosher albeit, temporary sukkah? Both sides of the roof would be off, but there is a .5 foot separation running down the middle.","
A few introductions:
A Sukkah has to:
be (and have walls that are) at least 32 inches tall and have width of at least 22.4 inches by 22.4 inches;
have at least 3 walls;
be a place where you are comfortable to eat, drink, spend time and sleep.
In this case:
A. the Schach would have to be covering a (uninterrupted) space that is 32″ tall and 22.4″ by 22.4″ (the seats would be considered an interruption);
B. the car (which is being used as walls) cannot be more than 9.48″ off the ground and the sides have to be directly under the Schach, and have above height;
C. you would have to be comfortable to eat sleep and spend time there.
See also here:
Can we connect a U-Haul trailer to the back of a car and have a Sukkah there. Can we go into that on Shabbos or Yom Tov?
In conclusion, unless you meet all the above requirements, it cannot be done.
See also the following excerpts from our Day to Day Halachic Guide:
MOBILE SUKKAH
A person who is traveling without access to a Sukkah, can create a Sukkah out of a vehicle (or two), as follows:
LOCATION
The spot you choose should be semi-secluded, and not on a public path where it would interfere with foot traffic. It should also be a safe, crime-free area, where you would technically be able to sleep at night. It should also fulfill the other requirements for the positioning of a Sukkah – the area above the s’chach free of tree limbs or overhangs
ASSEMBLY
Use the front and back door of a single vehicle (on the same side) or open a single door on mirroring sides of two vehicles. (The interior of a convertible or roadster that fits all the dimensions below can be used as well.)
The area created by the three sides (either the two doors and the one car body, or the two car bodies and the adjacent doors) has to be at least seven tefachim long and seven tefachim wide (about 22.5 inches on each side).
The doors must reach ten tefachim (3.25 feet) in height and start no more than three tefachim (9.5 inches) off the ground. Parking near a curb and opening the door(s) over the curb will help in this regard.
The doors must be fully and firmly open, so that a gust of wind will not slam them closed.
ROOF
It is preferable not to prop the s’chach directly on the car doors, but to first place wood laths or the like across and the s’chach on top of that. The s’chach should be fixed to the “roof” with jute twine or string (not zip ties) so that it will not blow away.
The above is set up in such a way that the “walls” of the Sukkah are adjacently perpendicular to the s’chach. If there is an area of four amos (six feet) of car roof on any side of the Sukkah or four tefachim (13 inches) of car roof or other unkosher covering in the middle of the Sukkah, it is unusable.115 If the mobile Sukkah is of the smallest possible size (seven by seven tefachim), any three-tefach span of car roof – whether in the middle or on the side – will invalidate it.
USE
You must hold your food or put it down on a table or surface inside your makeshift Sukkah. You may not eat under the s’chach and use the seat in the car (outside your Sukkah) as your table.
You must stipulate that the vehicle(s) will be able to be used for (non-holy) purposes after the Sukkah is dismantled, since, as stated above, we are usually not allowed to use the parts of a Sukkah for another purpose once they were used for a mitzvah.","###question 
  Am I allowed to use the sunroof of a car with Schach on it as a Sukkah when out on a family trip on Chol Hamoed Sukkos?
SimilarQuestion:
Can one make a sukkah by removing T tops and placing a mat on top, into a kosher albeit, temporary sukkah? Both sides of the roof would be off, but there is a .5 foot separation running down the middle..
 ###answer 
 
A few introductions:
A Sukkah has to:
be (and have walls that are) at least 32 inches tall and have width of at least 22.4 inches by 22.4 inches;
have at least 3 walls;
be a place where you are comfortable to eat, drink, spend time and sleep.
In this case:
A. the Schach would have to be covering a (uninterrupted) space that is 32″ tall and 22.4″ by 22.4″ (the seats would be considered an interruption);
B. the car (which is being used as walls) cannot be more than 9.48″ off the ground and the sides have to be directly under the Schach, and have above height;
C. you would have to be comfortable to eat sleep and spend time there.

Can we connect a U-Haul trailer to the back of a car and have a Sukkah there. Can we go into that on Shabbos or Yom Tov?
In conclusion, unless you meet all the above requirements, it cannot be done.
See also the following excerpts from our Day to Day Halachic Guide:
MOBILE SUKKAH
A person who is traveling without access to a Sukkah, can create a Sukkah out of a vehicle (or two), as follows:
LOCATION
The spot you choose should be semi-secluded, and not on a public path where it would interfere with foot traffic. It should also be a safe, crime-free area, where you would technically be able to sleep at night. It should also fulfill the other requirements for the positioning of a Sukkah – the area above the s’chach free of tree limbs or overhangs
ASSEMBLY
Use the front and back door of a single vehicle (on the same side) or open a single door on mirroring sides of two vehicles. (The interior of a convertible or roadster that fits all the dimensions below can be used as well.)
The area created by the three sides (either the two doors and the one car body, or the two car bodies and the adjacent doors) has to be at least seven tefachim long and seven tefachim wide (about 22.5 inches on each side).
The doors must reach ten tefachim (3.25 feet) in height and start no more than three tefachim (9.5 inches) off the ground. Parking near a curb and opening the door(s) over the curb will help in this regard.
The doors must be fully and firmly open, so that a gust of wind will not slam them closed.
ROOF
It is preferable not to prop the s’chach directly on the car doors, but to first place wood laths or the like across and the s’chach on top of that. The s’chach should be fixed to the “roof” with jute twine or string (not zip ties) so that it will not blow away.
The above is set up in such a way that the “walls” of the Sukkah are adjacently perpendicular to the s’chach. If there is an area of four amos (six feet) of car roof on any side of the Sukkah or four tefachim (13 inches) of car roof or other unkosher covering in the middle of the Sukkah, it is unusable.115 If the mobile Sukkah is of the smallest possible size (seven by seven tefachim), any three-tefach span of car roof – whether in the middle or on the side – will invalidate it.

"Is there an exception to that “rule”, like when auspicious days fall out on Shabbos? (i.e. are we supposed to go ahead and ask anyway?)","
According to Halacha one may not request their needs on Shabbos.
One of the reasons for this is because Shabbos accomplishes everything by itself without the need for us to resort to asking for it.  Even when Rosh Hashana or Yom Kippur – which are the most auspicious days of the year to request all of our needs – fall out on Shabbos we do not request our needs with Avinu Malkeinu.
You can make all your requests after Shabbos ends, especially regarding Yud Tes kislev which we celebrate the 20th of kislev as well.
Additionally, anything which is part of the standard text of davening is permitted. Thus, you may have your requests in mind in the Davening of Shabbos, especially during the sections of davening which we say on Shabbos for personal needs (which are permitted being that they are part of the Nussch which the Chachomim instituted) like Yehi Rotzon in the morning Berochos, the middle Beracha of Shabbos Shemone Esrei, Eloki Netzor at the end of Shemone Esrei, Brich Shmei when the Aron Hakodesh is opened and Yekum Purkan and Mi Shebeirach before Musaf. It is important that we have extra kavana when reciting these tefillos. This is more preferred over any personal prayers.
As well, requests for a Refuah Shleima of critically sick person or spiritual requests are permitted on Shabbos. However we do not confess our sins on Shabbos.
We must use out these auspicious days especially when they fall out on Shabbos for extra Davening, learning, Farbrengen and undertaking good resolutions.","###question

"Q1. For heartburn/acid reflux, may one chew Tums with letters on Shabbos? If not, what should one do?","A. Swallowing pills with letters isn’t a problem. The issue is eating where it breaks before swallowing.

The definition of Keli B’toch Keli is that at least one Keli isn’t designed specifically for this holy item.

• However, regarding someone whose birthday is on 19 Iyar, a day after Lag Baomer:
There are instructions from the Rebbe to perform the haircut on Lag Baomer.
While in most places it appears that it should take place on Lag Baomer itself (during the day), a day before the child turns 3, others record that it should be done on the actual birthday, right after nightfall on the night after Lag Baomer.
See here the testimony of three people who were all instructed by the Rebbe to do it on Lag Baomer: R. SB Popak, R. YY Hecht and R. Refoel Hartman. In the case of R. Hecht, the Rebbe himself did the cutting. (This information has been independently verified by us). In the case of R. Hartman, we have the actual answer of the Rebbe.
Independent of the above, there is yet another directive presented regarding the Upshernish of Ari Halberstam hy”d (whose birthday is on 19 Iyar), of which there are pictures of the Rebbe cutting the hair. See in the Hebrew references below.

There is such a custom that on Friday night the host leads the zimmun. Otherwise, he may honor the guest. This custom applies even when a kohen is present.
Explanation:
Although there is a mitzvah to honor the guests, this only applied in the past when only one individual bentched and he exempted the others. Nowadays, when everyone bentches themselves there is no such mitzvah. Even in those days, if the host wished to lead the bentching himself and not honor the guest, at any time, he may do so.
A kohen takes precedence only if he is equal in Torah standing to the others. Otherwise, the Talmid Chochom precedes him. Additionally, all this applies where all attendees are hosts or all are guests (and the host isn’t joining).","###question

 Are we careful about leaving water overnight? Do we need to invert pans after cleaning?,There are two issues:,"###question 
  Are we careful about leaving water overnight? Do we need to invert pans after cleaning?.
 ###answer 
 There are two issues:"
The problem is that we need to move there already this time next year since we are not able to afford to pay rent and mortgage at the same time and we cant start building until September. Any way around this?,"
All of this applies only if there was no building whatsoever in the entire area, even a small building.
If there was indeed no building, including a structure for the construction crew, the rule is as follows:
Regarding the area of the Shul, it is not an issue.
For the residential areas, if it’s for a home for a teacher or any other communal worker, it is not an issue. There’s also room for leniency if being bought by a young couple right after marriage.
If they’re being rented out and the owner is not the one living there, it’s not an issue either.
If the owner himself is living on the property, he should build a sukkah there first and afterwards it’s not a problem. Also, a proper Chanukas Habayis should be done to consecrate the home for Torah and Davening.
Another option is to make an independent “sale” of the home to someone else for the first year, and then one may live there immediately thereafter. (Alternatively, if you already own it prior to it being finished, you can sell it right then and there, and only when it’s complete will you re-purchase it).
Regardless, you should receive approval of three Rabbonim to go ahead with either of these leniencies.
The 12 months wait does not begin when the entire building was completed; it begins from when the building was above the height of the windows.","###question

My brother works in a store in Crown Heights and found a stroller that was left behind already for three days.

You have the obligation to publicize that you found this stroller in a way that the owner would find out about it (WhatsApp groups would not suffice under normal circumstances as not everyone has WhatsApp).
After a couple of days go by after you would assume that the owner found out where they lost it or who they can contact to receive their stroller back, you may:
1) Write down:
▪ Any Simanim that there is on the stroller;
▪ The time and place it was found.
2) Three people should evaluate the price and write it down.
From then on one can use the item for oneself.
If or when – with the coming of Moshiach, certainly the matter will be resolved – the owner should show up and give you the accurate details of the lost object, you are obligated to give them the amount it was worth at the time of the loss.","###question

 Does a garment that is 100% wool need to be checked for Shatnez?,"Yes.
According to American federal law, garments must have a label which lists the exact content of the fabric. However, this refers only to the material of the main shell fabric of the garment, but not to any threads or materials in the linings, backings, reinforcements, ornaments, padding, loops, fillings and other internal components. Thus, a label which states that the garment is 100% wool can contain as much as 2% of other materials and thus be shatnez.
Furthermore, the government is extremely lax in enforcing these laws. There isn’t also much concern for potential liability resulting from adverse reactions to the fabric, as fabric allergies are uncommon and usually not that serious. Many clothing manufacturers and distributors don’t bother therefore to identify accurately which fibers they use. They are may even deliberately misrepresent the information in order to boost their sales, since they know that they don’t much to fear from law enforcement agencies or other potential liabilities.
This is true even in places where such laws are in place. Many garments are manufactured in labor-cheap, third-world countries where mislabeling is common practice.","###question

It is forbidden to answer “Thank G-d”. As it is considered saying Shem Shomayim l’vatalah.
Adding the word A-mighty doesn’t make it acceptable either; rather, it’s considered saying two names of Hashem l’vatalah. Some suggest saying “Thank the L-rd”, but not everybody considers this an acceptable option either. As for the Rebbe saying often “May G-d A-mighty bless you”, see below in the references.
There are many alternatives and you may choose whatever you are most comfortable with. For example, “Thank the One above”; “Thank G, O, D” (pronouncing the actual letters), or “Thank Him” (pointing upwards). You can choose any variation of the above, or other original ideas.
You should however not try to avoid thanking Him by using secular alternatives, such as “Thank Goodness”, as there is a Mitzvah to thank Hashem for everything.
May I add that the fact that it might sound bizarre shouldn’t be a concern; on the contrary, it is an opportunity to be Mekadesh Shem Shomayim and explain where possible and relevant your behavior, in order to show reverence to G-d, and in line with Halacha, Jewish law. Society nowadays respects people who live up to their values; bizarreness often provides an added dimension of intrigue leading to more respect and even awe.
As to your comment about Ama D’bar (the common custom of society at large) saying it, this is unfortunately true.

The Rebbe once mentioned that the custom of Chassidim is to “Chap Arein” (difficult to translate, especially in this context; perhaps, rush into it or seize the opportunity) and recite the Bracha silently."

 Is it OK to go to the Ohel at night?,"Question:
Is it OK to go to the Ohel at night?
How about not eating; I can’t eat all day, or it’s OK not to eat just from Shkiah?
Answer
The common custom is not to go to a Beis Hakvaros at night. While many have written extensively on this topic, proving that there’s no issue whatsoever with going at night, we find in the writings of the Minchas Elazar that one is supposed to go to Davka by day.
Nonetheless, there is no halachic prohibition to go at night. Indeed, many people do go at night, especially when going to Kivrei Tzadikm. When going at night, one shouldn’t say Chapters of Tehilim.
It is noteworthy, however, that although the Rebbe would frequent the Ohel on a constant basis, as far as we know he never went at night, though many times the visit extended long into the night.
The custom is to drink but not eat before visiting the Ohel.
There is no clear source which discusses this custom vis-a-vis going at night. Some say one may eat straight until sunset. Nonetheless many have the custom not to eat from the morning. At the same time, one should certainly not go on a full stomach. If going immediately after sunset, it makes sense to stop eating a while before that.","###question

 Are all watches permissible to be worn on Shabbos? Are they Muktzeh?,"Watches are not Muktzah unless you need to press a button to see the time.
Non-working watch: According to many opinions, if the watch is not working it is Muktzah.
Electrical: Even if the watch contains a computer inside it is not Muktzah, since its main purpose is to display the time. If you know that you are likely to press the button and use the computer, you should not wear it on Shabbos. Likewise, if it has a button to produce light and you might out of habit press it at night, you should put a sticker or something to remind you not to do so on Shabbos. Some put their watch on the other hand to help them remember not to do so on Shabbos.
Room temperature: A watch that displays the room temperature may not be worn, since this watch works only due to the movements of the one wearing the watch. If it measures the temperature but does not display it unless a button is pressed, it may be worn.
Glow in the dark: If a light turns on when you go into a dark room then it is a problem; if it just glows in the dark then it is okay.
Self-winding: Some watches are powered through movement. Although many are lenient, it is best for one not to wear a self-winding watch on Shabbos, because whenever you move your hand it causes the watch to recharge, especially or once you removed it from your hand and want to put it back. Many Poskim agree that it should not be worn on Shabbos once it stopped or if it is not sufficiently recharged to last throughout Shabbos.
Solar-powered: The same applies to a solar-powered watch which will recharge when entering a place which it well lit.
 Kinetic Watch: A kinetic watch operates slightly differently, where instead of a battery, one’s movement generates the needed. This is more severe and should certainly not be worn on Shabbos, especially with kinetic watches with digital displays. All the more so, with an Eco-Drive watch which enters slow down mode when there is no light and returns to normal function (digital displays, correct second hand time, etc.) when exposed to light.
Apple watches or Fitbits are forbidden on Shabbos. Your movements activate the functions and the display, it tracks all your steps, monitors your heartbeat and so much more.
If Shabbos started and you forgot to remove your apple watch, you should take it off right away, preferably by undoing the buckle and dropping it off your hand. One cannot move freely until it’s removed.
Many Chassidim do not wear a watch at all on Shabbos or Yom Tov.

Also, is there an inyan to daven for the amud if I am not saying kaddish?.
 ###answer 
 
The general custom is that a parent says. There’s an advantage of davening for the amud even when not saying kaddeishim. Davening for the amud is even more important than kaddish.

 Why do some people not drink red wine between 6 and 7 on friday?,"White wine: There is a custom not to make kiddush on Friday nights between 6 and 7. The original sources make no mention of red wine specifically; likewise, the explanations provided for the custom do not link it with the color of wine either. The accepted interpretation is that this applies to all types of wine, and according to many – even if one makes kiddush on bread.
The reason for this custom: the Gemara tells us that the hours of the day are associated with the seven Mazalos, constellations or planets – Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, each one operating hour of the day in a rotating system; these celestial forces have influence on this world during their corresponding hour. During this hour of 6-7, the constellation of Tzedek (and its corresponding angel Tzadkiel) ceases to be dominant and the constellation of Maadim takes over. Maadim (and its corresponding angel, Samael, pronounced usually as “the Samach Mem”, the source of evil who rules over this Mazal), -the mazal identified with the Esav (Edom), Amalek and Haman- is associated with negative influences and is said to be the cause of destruction, plagues, murder, sickness, and punishment, among other such causes. The Gemara tells us that those born during the hour of Maadim have a tendency towards becoming a Shochet or Mohel, a profession involving bloodshed.
Thus, it’s recommended to avoid acceptance of Shabbos through kiddush in the times when Maadim dominates, so as not to add spiritual energy to Maadim. The reason for the partcular caution when making kiddush because Chazal tell us that two angels accompany people on their way back home from shule on Friday night—a good angel and an evil angel. If the house has been prepared (the candle lit, the table set etc.), the good angel gives a blessing that the next Shabbos will be the same, and the evil angel is forced to respond Amen. If the house is not prepared for Shabbos, the evil angel wishes that the next Shabbos will be the same, and the good angel is forced to respond Amen. These two angels correspond to the Mazalos of Tzedek, Jupiter, and Maadim, Mars. Thus, at this time it’s important not to allow the negative angel dominion over us.","###question

 Is an oven with Cook-time or Stop-time Mode acceptable for Shabbos use?,"There are many ovens on the market, and it is impossible in this short space to investigate and address every single model. The best we can do is provide a summary of the many issues to look out for. It is important that you read through the manuals of any model you are considering for purchase, in order to determine whether, and to what degree, the issues outlined below apply.
Thermostat:
The main problem with using a oven on Shabbos is the thermostat, which is affected by opening or closing the oven while the oven is on. When the oven door is opened, the thermostat will detect the cold air that rushes in and will activate the heating element if it is off at that moment. It is forbidden to cause this to occur, even if all the food will be removed all at once before the oven door is re-closed. [If the oven door is re-closed with some of the food remaining inside, there may be additional concerns of Bishul on Shabbos, depending on the circumstances.]  The thermostat is not a concern for Yom Tov use, but there are additional problems with a oven on Yom Tov as detailed below.
If the oven is off, like after the cook-time or stop time has finished this would not be an issue.
the problem with using such an oven on Yom Tov is primarily a practical one; most modern ovens have an auto shut-off feature that turns the oven off after around 6-12 hours. Yet another problem, applicable on both Shabbos and Yom Tov, is that many models have lights or fans that are activated and deactivated as the door is opened or closed. In summary, a modern oven without Sabbath Mode may be completely unusable on Shabbos and Yom Tov.
Ovens with “Sabbath Mode”:
Buying an oven with Sabbath Mode will alleviate many of these problems. Sabbath Mode will generally disable the oven’s display panel and any electronic controls, as well as disengage the fans and lights from being activated by opening and closing the oven door. The Sabbath Mode feature will also disable the auto shut-off feature. However, one very big problem, at least with regards to most models, is that the thermostat usually remains operative. [Some ovens have a light which illuminates when the heating element is on, in which case the oven could theoretically be opened when the light is on. However, it has been demonstrated through rigorous testing that these indicator lights are generally inaccurate, and may be illuminated even when the heating element is off.]
The thermostat does not present a problem for Yom Tov use, but makes it completely forbidden on Shabbos, according to most opinions. The outcome is that, ironically, the Sabbath Mode oven remains forbidden for Shabbos use, and is permitted only on Yom Tov. Perhaps it would have been more apt to name this feature “Yom Tov Mode”.
There is a practical workaround for Shabbos use that is easy and simple: Estimate about what time the main course will be served, and make sure that the oven turns off before then. This is generally easy to achieve, as the Sabbath Mode feature can usually be set to turn the oven off in any increment amount of time up until 72 or 96 hours. So, you can easily set the oven to go off after 2 or 3 hours, for example. Once the oven is off, opening the door does not create a problem with regards to the thermostat.
However, this method will usually create a new problem, which requires its own workaround. Now that the oven is off, this means that Sabbath Mode is now deactivated as well, and opening the door will turn the light on (if the oven has a light). This can be circumvented before Shabbos by manipulating the magnets or levers that detect whether the door is open. The specific manner of circumvention will vary from model to model, and in the case of magnetic detectors, may take some trial-and-error. Some oven doors are designed to be taken apart to allow proper cleaning of all the glass panes, and the magnet can be physically removed from the door. In other models, it may work to place a strong and thin magnet on the oven wall at the correct place.(The location of the oven’s magnet can usually be detected by sliding a paperclip around the top of the oven door.) These options may or may not work, depending on the model, so you would have to try before Shabbos, when you have the time and patience to troubleshoot it. [Note: Disabling the magnetic sensor only helps with regards to the functions controlled by the door sensor, such as the oven light and fans. However, the thermostat is not controlled by the door sensor, which is why the oven needs to be off before opening the door on Shabbos.]
Following the advice above, when Shabbos is followed by Yom Tov, one would have to choose whether to reserve the oven’s use for Shabbos or Yom Tov, as using it on Shabbos would require the oven to be set to turn off on Shabbos, in which case it will remain off for the duration of Yom Tov as well.
The Issur of Sheiyah with regards to an oven:
The above answer focuses purely on using the oven itself. However, there are also restrictions about which foods may be placed in an oven before Shabbos without a Blech, and much discussion about whether, and how, a Blech can be facilitated in an oven. Here is a brief summary of the issues:
From the Torah perspective, one may place food over an open flame before Shabbos in order that it cooks on Shabbos. Nevertheless, Chazal forbade this due to the concern that a person may come to stoke the fire on Shabbos in order to speed up the cooking process. This prohibition is knownas Shehiya.
One method of avoiding Shehiya is to cover the flames, typically with a Blech. Covering the fire indicates that one does not desire a strong flame, it diverts his attention from the fire, and it serves as a reminder not to increase the flames. With regards to an oven, there is a dispute whether – and how – a Blech can be adequately created. In practice, a Blech in an oven should be situated so that it covers the heating elements, which may be located either at the top of the oven, the bottom or the backwall. In many ovens, there are heating elements in all of these places.
Another way of addressing Shehiya, and to sidestep the need for a Blech, is to ensure that the food is cooked prior to Shabbos. It is sufficient if the food is already half cooked.  This fraction does not represent time, but rather, is qualitative and measured against the degree of cooking most people would regard as fully cooked. Nevertheless, for a number of reasons, it is best that the food be fully baked before Shabbos.
There is yet a third possible way to circumvent the prohibition of Shehiya. Chazal allowed one to put completely raw meat on an open flame just before the onset of Shabbos. They were not concerned that one might come to stoke the flames, because doing so would not serve any productive purpose – it would not ready the meat in time for the Friday night meal, nor would it be necessary to ready the meat in time for the Shabbos day meal. This leniency is known as “Kidra Chaysa” – literally: raw pot. (Indeed, some people may wish to put raw chicken and rice right before Shabbos to slow bake in the oven for the daytime Seudas Shabbos.)
In order for this leniency to apply, two criteria must be met. First, the food item must be one that takes a relatively long time to cook properly (such as meat). Second, the food must be put on the fire just before Shabbos, late enough that it will not begin cooking before Shabbos comes in. Some contemporary Poskim therefore assert that this leniency seldom applies nowadays, because most modern cooking appliances are able to cook in a relatively short amount of time. As a case in point, meat put up to cook rightat the  onset of Shabbos would usually be fit for consumption by the time the meat course  arrives. Even if the heat is set to low, this does not diminish the oven’s overall ability to bake quickly, because the seat heating can be easily raised. Thus, according to these Poskim, this option is not applicable to a modern oven.
Other associated issues:
1. It should be pointed out that even when the oven is off and cold, if it will be turned on with a Shabbos clock or a timer (see next point), one may not place inside any food which is not completely cooked. Furthermore, even completely cooked food that has cooled down may not be placed inside either, unless the food is completely dry (and will remain dry when heated). The same applies to an oven which will remain off but has  not yet cooled down.
2. With regards to Shabbos clocks in general, the Rebbe writes in a letter (Igros Kodesh Vol 12 page 192): “There are those who are extremely stringent and are even sceptical about the permissibility of using a Shabbos clock… Therefore, I am abstaining from giving this idea in an official capacity.” Even so, it is reported that the Rebbe instructed some individuals that they may be used (See Shulchan Menachem Volume 2 page 173).  At the same time, many authorities who permit Shabbos clocks in general nevertheless rule that they should not be used with regards to cooking specifically, for a number of reasons.
For further discussion of these issues, including sources, please see the following links:","###question 
  Is an oven with Cook-time or Stop-time Mode acceptable for Shabbos use?.
 ###answer 
 There are many ovens on the market, and it is impossible in this short space to investigate and address every single model. The best we can do is provide a summary of the many issues to look out for. It is important that you read through the manuals of any model you are considering for purchase, in order to determine whether, and to what degree, the issues outlined below apply.
Thermostat:
The main problem with using a oven on Shabbos is the thermostat, which is affected by opening or closing the oven while the oven is on. When the oven door is opened, the thermostat will detect the cold air that rushes in and will activate the heating element if it is off at that moment. It is forbidden to cause this to occur, even if all the food will be removed all at once before the oven door is re-closed. [If the oven door is re-closed with some of the food remaining inside, there may be additional concerns of Bishul on Shabbos, depending on the circumstances.]  The thermostat is not a concern for Yom Tov use, but there are additional problems with a oven on Yom Tov as detailed below.
If the oven is off, like after the cook-time or stop time has finished this would not be an issue.
the problem with using such an oven on Yom Tov is primarily a practical one; most modern ovens have an auto shut-off feature that turns the oven off after around 6-12 hours. Yet another problem, applicable on both Shabbos and Yom Tov, is that many models have lights or fans that are activated and deactivated as the door is opened or closed. In summary, a modern oven without Sabbath Mode may be completely unusable on Shabbos and Yom Tov.
Ovens with “Sabbath Mode”:
Buying an oven with Sabbath Mode will alleviate many of these problems. Sabbath Mode will generally disable the oven’s display panel and any electronic controls, as well as disengage the fans and lights from being activated by opening and closing the oven door. The Sabbath Mode feature will also disable the auto shut-off feature. However, one very big problem, at least with regards to most models, is that the thermostat usually remains operative. [Some ovens have a light which illuminates when the heating element is on, in which case the oven could theoretically be opened when the light is on. However, it has been demonstrated through rigorous testing that these indicator lights are generally inaccurate, and may be illuminated even when the heating element is off.]
The thermostat does not present a problem for Yom Tov use, but makes it completely forbidden on Shabbos, according to most opinions. The outcome is that, ironically, the Sabbath Mode oven remains forbidden for Shabbos use, and is permitted only on Yom Tov. Perhaps it would have been more apt to name this feature “Yom Tov Mode”.

 In which tone should Shmoneh Esreh be recited?,"
Here is a quote from the Alter Rebbe’s Shulchan Aruch (OCH 101:2):
“One should not pray in his heart alone. Rather, he should articulate the words with his lips and whisper them audibly [the literal translation of the original would be: “make them heard by his ears”]. He should not, however, make his voice heard (by someone standing more than four cubits away), as it is written [regarding Chanh in I Shmuel 1:13] , “Only her lips were moving, but her voice was not heard.” A person who projects his voice during She­moneh Esreh is one of those whose faith is meager — as if the Holy One, blessed be He, would not hear a whispered prayer. (The Sages ordained that Shemoneh Esreh should be uttered in an absolute whisper, i.e., it should be heard by one’s own ears alone, so as not to embarrass transgressors who confess their sins when praying.)
Now, the Zoher and some Mekubalim (referenced in Likkutei Sichos vol. 35 in the Sicha (1) for Parshas Vayigash) hold that although one must verbalize his words, it should still be done completely quietly that even one himself shouldn’t hear himself. (This is because uncording to Kabbalah She­moneh Esreh is an expression of the highest level of Bittul where one’s entire being is completely nullified, thus his voice isn’t heard).
I have yet to find any reliable source which says that in this case we should follow the mekubalim, and there are Poskim (also brought by the Rebbe in that Sicha) who write that this instruction of the Arizal was a horoah l’yochid, and wasn’t directed to the public.

 Is there any reason why women don’t do Mayim Achronim?,"Strictly speaking, there is no difference between men and women. Nonetheless, the custom has developed that women are lenient in this matter.
The suggested explanation for the leniency among women is because nowadays washing Mayim Acharonim is considered as a Chumra and women haven’t taken it upon their self.
More specifically, there are generally three reasons for washing Mayim Acharonim:
A concern for a particular type of salt which when touches the eye can cause blindness.
Because the hands are dirty from food and one may not Bentch reciting Hashem’s name with dirty hands.
According to Kabalah, the purpose of Mayim Acharonim is to give the “other side” (evil forces) a small portion of the meal so that they don’t prosecute against us.
The Poskim mention that there are those who are not accustomed to wash because this type of salt is no longer common. As for the dirty hands, since nowadays people are not particular to wash their hands after meals, thus this wouldn’t be considered an obstacle to Benching. An additional explanation (mentioned specifically with regards to women) is that they are careful to eat with spoons and forks, and their hands do not touch the actual food. As for the Kabbalistic reason, women generally are not accustomed to follow Kabbalistic practices. Therefore, since washing Mayim Acharonim nowadays is considered an extra stringency women have not adopted this practice.
Of course, the above is only an explanation of an existing custom common among women. Clearly, if a woman knows her hands are dirty she may not Bentch without washing her hands first. Even absent the dirty hands, it is recommended – but not obligatory – that woman always wash Mayim Acharonim, without calling attention to her practice.","###question

Because the hands are dirty from food and one may not Bentch reciting Hashem’s name with dirty hands.
According to Kabalah, the purpose of Mayim Acharonim is to give the “other side” (evil forces) a small portion of the meal so that they don’t prosecute against us.
The Poskim mention that there are those who are not accustomed to wash because this type of salt is no longer common. As for the dirty hands, since nowadays people are not particular to wash their hands after meals, thus this wouldn’t be considered an obstacle to Benching. An additional explanation (mentioned specifically with regards to women) is that they are careful to eat with spoons and forks, and their hands do not touch the actual food. As for the Kabbalistic reason, women generally are not accustomed to follow Kabbalistic practices. Therefore, since washing Mayim Acharonim nowadays is considered an extra stringency women have not adopted this practice.
Of course, the above is only an explanation of an existing custom common among women. Clearly, if a woman knows her hands are dirty she may not Bentch without washing her hands first. Even absent the dirty hands, it is recommended – but not obligatory – that woman always wash Mayim Acharonim, without calling attention to her practice."
" Is a woman permitted to tub bathe and/or swim on an Onas Prisha?
Rav Braun, I am writing to ask if you can please clarify the issue of tub bathing and swimming on an Onas Prisha – both Onah Beinonis and the other Onos (Haflagah and Chodesh).
We have been taught that this is not permitted lechatchilla (nor is internal washing) and if the need is great to swim or bathe (in tub, not shower) that one should ask a Rav, which usually results in being told to do a bedikah prior to swimming or tub bathing on an Onas Prisha.
Iwas told that some poskim hold that if a woman did tub bathe or swim (water reachinginternally, which is unavoidable in such cases) on an onah beinonis, on her own, then she would have to start sheva nekiim over again. The Alter Rebbe does not hold this way, and if a woman did do this, she would not have to begin her count again.
We would like to confirm the issue. Namely, is a woman permitted to tub bathe and/or swim on an Onas Prisha, and in particular on the Onah Beinonis (or a kavuah) at all, or is a bedikah required beforehand, or nothing is required and it is not an issue.","

" When should one get his hair cut before Shavuos this year, since Erev Shavuos is Shabbos?","It is a Mitzvah to have hair cut before every Yom Tov, so as not to enter into Yom Tov unkempt.

" I didn’t see the moon (yet) tonight (Leil Yud daled). Tomorrow night I will be flying. What should I do if I see the moon on the plane, should I do it then or can I / should I push it off until the next night?","If you see the moon on the plane, you should do Kiddush Levana, and not risk the chance of missing Kiddush Levana altogether.
Explanation:
The Minhag is that Kiddush Levana is not performed under a roof (OC 426:4). There are two reasons for this Minhag:
According to the Bach (OC 426), it is disrespectful when one does not make the effort to leave one’s home and go out to greet the king; how much more so when greeting the Shechinah. [It might be argued that this reason does not apply when in an airplane, where it is impossible to “go out and greet the king”, and staying inside is therefore not an act of disrespect.]
According to the Maharil (cited in Magen Avraham OC 426:14), the concern is that there might be Tumah within the building, and it is appropriate that one should greet the Shechinah in a place which is Tahor.
In any case, the Bach rules that this Minhag applies only where practical. In cases where it is not practical to go outdoors, such as an (even mildly) ill person who is housebound, or someone who is frightened of the reactions of the Gentiles, may recite Kiddush Levana at the window. The Bach’s ruling is brought down by the Taz (OC 426:4) and Magen Avraham (ibid) and other Achronim. The Magen Avraham provides another (more obvious) example – when the outdoors is filthy and not befitting the Bracha.
There is a further discussion in the Poskim whether one may view the moon from behind a (transparent glass or plastic) windowpane. The Pri Megadim (Mishbetzos Zahav OC 426:4) rules that one may do so when it is not possible to open the window, such as in your situation. The Birchei Yosef (OC 426:4) seems to conclude that it is unnecessary to open the window at all. [This particular issue is a far-ranging one in Halacha, and also concerns vision through glasses, but the common practice is to be lenient in this matter, especially when the pane is completely transparent.]","###question

This is not proper for a religious crowd. Poskim advise against this. (Men need to look at the speaker, and to have men looking at a woman speak for a long period of time is not Tznius. We find in the Poskim that by the age of 9, it is important to have only male teachers).
Some poskim even forbid it outright.
(See Shaarei Yosher III: 21. Shevet Halevi 3:14. Mishnah Halachos 5:218. 11: 58. L’horos Nasan 1 EH 60:5. Igros Moshe OC 5: 12. See also ibid. 2:36).
However, if the crowd is not religious, and the purpose is to teach them Torah, there could be some room for leniency in very specific scenarios, and one should seek guidance from a Rav."

" A publication wants to print this letter and wants to know if you approve of it?
Do you approve of the following?
I recommend to consider that a couple getting married in their early twenties can expect to spend sixty years together, which is about five hundred thousand hours, and therefore should consider spending at least fifty hours getting to know their potential spouse before marrying them. Fifty hours is the equivalent of ten five hour dates and would only be one ten-thousandth of the time that they can expect to spend together. I think that it is obviously very unwise to marry someone without spending at least fifty hours getting to know them, and I recommend to go on at least ten five-hour dates before marrying someone.","
I don’t approve. Aside of the Hashkafah issues, there are some technical flaws in the logic here.
Couples don’t spend 24 hours a day together. That reduces your amount of hours significantly.
There is also no solid evidence that getting to know someone better, or for more time before marriage has bearing on the success rate of the marriage. Even if it does has bearing, as some argue, it’s obvious that serious commitment and shared goals are the ultimate influences on the durability of the marriage.
It should be noted that in many other circles they hardly see each other before marriage and they have a high success rate of lasting marriages. Historically, our ancestors who hardly dated also have a history of longer-lasting marriages.","###question

" Is one who finds it harmful to eat dairy permitted to eat chicken during the Nine Days?
I saw in Kitzur Shulchon Aruch (122:8) that one who finds it harmful to eat dairy they are permitted to eat meat of a chicken. Is this accurate? If yes, am I permitted to eat chicken as I am highly allergic to all dairy products to the extent where I carry an EpiPen where ever I go, G-d forbid I need it.","
That is correct.
The reason for abstaining from meat during the Nine Days is twofold:
Because meat is associated with joy.
Because meat is reminiscent of the Korbonos which were halted at the time of the Churban.
These reasons don’t apply to the same degree with regards to chicken – it is not associated to the same degree with joy, and because chicken was not offered up as a Korbon.
Although the Minhag is to abstain from chicken nonetheless, and there is absolutely no leniency for a healthy person, the Bach (552:2) and Magen Avraham (551:28) are lenient for a person to whom dairy is harmful. This is because abstaining from all dairy and all meat for a period of nine days would have a detrimental health effect (Shvus Yaakov §36), and is therefore allowed when needed (Oruch Hashulchan 551:24).
The concern of a detrimental health effect certainly loomed large in times bygone when the range of available food was relatively minimal. Therefore, in our times, when there is a wide range of high protein foods, it would be appropriate to avoid poultry as well if you are absolutely certain that this will not lead to detrimental health effects.","###question

 What Brachah do I say when I see a River or an Ocean?,"Article: A Brachah on Rivers
The brachah of Oseh ma’aseh bereishis (thanking Hashem for the wonders of creation) should be recited when we see a large river that has been around since sheishes yemei breishis (the beginning of creation).
However, if the river has changed course, even if it happened biyedei shamayaim (due to a natural act from Above), we don’t say the brachah. When encountering a river, we needn’t be concerned that its course may have changed over time, but if it’s unknown whether the river dates back to sheishes yemei breishis, no brachah should be said. This is one of the reasons that this brachah is seldom recited, since the provenance of most rivers is unknown. Poskim say, though, that there is no concern with saying the brachah if we see very large rivers, such as the Mississippi.
None of the issues concerning rivers apply to oceans; we certainly should make a brachah when seeing an ocean. Upon seeing the “yam hagadol” (the ‘great ocean’), a special brachah, She’asah es (or Oseh) hayam hagadol, ought to be said. However, since we don’t know which ocean bears that name, we say Oseh maaseh breishis instead. Some maintain that the brachah for the yam hagadol should be recited when seeing any ocean which encircles continents, such as the Atlantic Ocean.
These Brachos are only recited once every 30 days.

One may not engage in any behavior which causes one to engage in laughter or lose focus of mourning. Already from Rosh Chodesh Menachem Av one must decrease acts of happiness.
At the same time we may never fall into depression and must serve Hashem with Simcha. Davening and Avodas Hashem must be B’Simcha. And even the recital of Kinos must involve Simcha that we are privileged to serve Hashem.","###question

" When is the optimal time to put on Rabbeinu Tam Tefillin in a non-Chabad Rosh Chodesh Minyan that doesn’t take a break after U’va Letziyon?
If I’m behind, or if the minyan does not put Rabbeinu Tam (ashkenaz) can I first daven musaf with the minyan and then put Rabbeinu Tam tefillin?","
Our custom is to put on Rabbeinu Tam tefillin before musaf. If the minyan does not wait, one should make every effort to be able put on the tefillin earlier in davening. One should be careful not to remove tefillin shel rosh in the presence of a sefer Torah; they should turn and face the other way or do it under the tallis.
There is also an important idea of having the Rebeinu Tam on as soon as possible when taking off the Rashi Tefillin so that the blessing that was said on Rashi will count for Rebeinu Tam Tefillin (see Shulchan Aruch Admor Hazaken 34:5).
Additionally, based on Kabalah from the Arizal it is not ideal to put on Rebeinu Tam after davening Mussaf, (see Kaf Hachayim Orach Chayim 25:94-96)  since there is a level of Kedushas Musaf and it is no longer the time for Tefillin.
Question:
Could I go ahead of the minyan by saying ashrei and u’va l’tzion in the breaks between aliyos during krias haTorah which would give me time to put Rabbeinu Tam tefillin while the congregation would be saying ashrei and uva letzion or it is better to say ashrey and u’va l’tzion with the minyan to miss davening musaf with the minyan?
Answer: 
It’s better to say ashrei earlier so as not to miss musaf with a minyan. However, you the davener may decide what is best for yourself, (to go ahead of the minyan or not) in this specific case.
In any event, if one takes off his Tefillin before the Sefer Torah is returned to the Ark, he should not do so in the presence of the Sefer Torah, but should turn aside. This is so not to dishonor the Sefer Torah. (See Shulchan Aruch Admur Hazaken Orach Chayim 25:42).","###question

 Am I allowed to eat in a married woman’s kitchen if she does not cover her hair?,"This depends on various factors.

Sefer HaMinhagim records Minhag Chabad as avoiding weddings in Cheshvan.
However, in the later years (5740’s), the Rebbe made it clear that it is far more preferable to make a wedding as soon as possible, even if this means that it will occur in Cheshvan."

 Do stockings for women’s legwear need to be opaque?,"Questions:
1. Must a woman’s stockings be opaque (I.e. the leg isn’t seen through the stockings)?
2. Is it permissible to wear stockings which cover the leg completely (no holes), are somewhat sheer (can see the leg through hosiery) but are visibly not the woman’s leg (I.e. there is a seam or design, or the color is darker than the leg/black)
Answers:
The area below the knee is considered the Shok and thus is an Ervah and therefore must be covered. The denier of the stockings should be such that it is impossible to see the legs through the stockings. Yet, it need not conceal the shape of the leg. Some suggest the number 40 and others suggest higher numbers.
There are many women who are accustomed to wearing stockings of a lesser denier. While this goes against the straightforward understanding of the halacha, there is some room within halacha to defend those do so, as long as it blurs the image of the leg. Lechatchila one should be Machmir that the skin shouldn’t be visible at all, as above.","###question

 Is an oven with Sabbath Mode truly acceptable for Shabbos use?,"There are many ovens on the market, and it is impossible in this short space to investigate and address every single model. The best we can do is provide a summary of the many issues to look out for. It is important that you read through the manuals of any model you are considering for purchase, in order to determine whether, and to what degree, the issues outlined below apply.
Modern ovens without “Sabbath Mode”:
First, let us focus on modern ovens which do not have a Sabbath Mode feature. Such ovens are challenging to use for Shabbos and Yom Tov, for a number of reasons. The main problem with using them on Shabbos is the thermostat, which is affected by opening or closing the oven. When the oven door is opened, the thermostat will detect the cold air that rushes in and will activate the heating element if it is off at that moment. It is forbidden to cause this to occur, even if all the food will be removed all at once before the oven door is re-closed. [If the oven door is re-closed with some of the food remaining inside, there may be additional concerns of Bishul on Shabbos, depending on the circumstances.]
The thermostat is not a concern for Yom Tov use, but the problem with using such an oven on Yom Tov is primarily a practical one; most modern ovens have an auto shut-off feature that turns the oven off after around 6-12 hours. Yet another problem, applicable on both Shabbos and Yom Tov, is that many models have lights or fans that are activated and deactivated as the door is opened or closed. In summary, a modern oven without Sabbath Mode may be completely unusable on Shabbos and Yom Tov.
Ovens with “Sabbath Mode”:
Buying an oven with Sabbath Mode will alleviate many of these problems. Sabbath Mode will generally disable the oven’s display panel and any electronic controls, as well as disengage the fans and lights from being activated by opening and closing the oven door. The Sabbath Mode feature will also disable the auto shut-off feature. However, one very big problem, at least with regards to most models, is that the thermostat usually remains operative. [Some ovens have a light which illuminates when the heating element is on, in which case the oven could theoretically be opened when the light is on. However, it has been demonstrated through rigorous testing that these indicator lights are generally inaccurate, and may be illuminated even when the heating element is off.]
The thermostat does not present a problem for Yom Tov use, but makes it completely forbidden on Shabbos, according to most opinions. The outcome is that, ironically, the Sabbath Mode oven remains forbidden for Shabbos use, and is permitted only on Yom Tov. Perhaps it would have been more apt to name this feature “Yom Tov Mode”.
There is a practical workaround for Shabbos use that is easy and simple: Estimate about what time the main course will be served, and make sure that the oven turns off before then. This is generally easy to achieve, as the Sabbath Mode feature can usually be set to turn the oven off in any increment amount of time up until 72 or 96 hours. So, you can easily set the oven to go off after 2 or 3 hours, for example. Once the oven is off, opening the door does not create a problem with regards to the thermostat.
However, this method will usually create a new problem, which requires its own workaround. Now that the oven is off, this means that Sabbath Mode is now deactivated as well, and opening the door will turn the light on (if the oven has a light). This can be circumvented before Shabbos by manipulating the magnets or levers that detect whether the door is open. The specific manner of circumvention will vary from model to model, and in the case of magnetic detectors, may take some trial-and-error. Some oven doors are designed to be taken apart to allow proper cleaning of all the glass panes, and the magnet can be physically removed from the door. In other models, it may work to place a strong and thin magnet on the oven wall at the correct place. (The location of the oven’s magnet can usually be detected by sliding a paperclip around the top of the oven door.) These options may or may not work, depending on the model, so you would have to try before Shabbos, when you have the time and patience to troubleshoot it. [Note: Disabling the magnetic sensor only helps with regards to the functions controlled by the door sensor, such as the oven light and fans. However, the thermostat is not controlled by the door sensor, which is why the oven needs to be off before opening the door on Shabbos.]
Following the advice above, when Shabbos is followed by Yom Tov, one would have to choose whether to reserve the oven’s use for Shabbos or Yom Tov, as using it on Shabbos would require the oven to be set to turn off on Shabbos, in which case it will remain off for the duration of Yom Tov as well.
The Issur of Shehiya with regards to an oven:
The above answer focuses purely on using the oven itself. However, there are also restrictions about which foods may be placed in an oven before Shabbos without a Blech, and much discussion about whether, and how, a Blech can be facilitated in an oven. Here is a brief summary of the issues:
From the Torah perspective, one may place food over an open flame before Shabbos in order that it cooks on Shabbos. Nevertheless, Chazal forbade this due to the concern that a person may come to stoke the fire on Shabbos in order to speed up the cooking process. This prohibition is known as Shehiya.
One method of avoiding Shehiya is to cover the flames, typically with a Blech. Covering the fire indicates that one does not desire a strong flame, it diverts his attention from the fire, and it serves as a reminder not to increase the flames. With regards to an oven, there is a dispute whether – and how – a Blech can be adequately created. In practice, a Blech in an oven should be situated so that it covers the heating elements, which may be located either at the top of the oven, the bottom or the back-wall. In many ovens, there are heating elements in all of these places.
Another way of addressing Shehiya, and to sidestep the need for a Blech, is to ensure that the food is cooked prior to Shabbos. It is sufficient if the food is already half cooked.  This fraction does not represent time, but rather, is qualitative and measured against the degree of cooking most people would regard as fully cooked. Nevertheless, for a number of reasons, it is best that the food be fully baked before Shabbos.
There is yet a third possible way to circumvent the prohibition of Shehiya. Chazal allowed one to put completely raw meat on an open flame just before the onset of Shabbos. They were not concerned that one might come to stoke the flames, because doing so would not serve any productive purpose – it would not ready the meat in time for the Friday night meal, nor would it be necessary to ready the meat in time for the Shabbos day meal. This leniency is known as “Kidra Chaysa” – literally: raw pot. (Indeed, some people may wish to put raw chicken and rice right before Shabbos to slow bake in the oven for the daytime Seudas Shabbos.)
In order for this leniency to apply, two criteria must be met. First, the food item must be one that takes a relatively long time to cook properly (such as meat). Second, the food must be put on the fire just before Shabbos, late enough that it will not begin cooking before Shabbos comes in. Some contemporary Poskim therefore assert that this leniency seldom applies nowadays, because most modern cooking appliances are able to cook in a relatively short amount of time. As a case in point, meat put up to cook right at the onset of Shabbos would usually be fit for consumption by the time the meat course  arrives. Even if the heat is set to low, this does not diminish the oven’s overall ability to bake quickly, because the seat heating can be easily raised. Thus, according to these Poskim, this option is not applicable to a modern oven.
Other associated issues:
1. It should be pointed out that even when the oven is off and cold, if it will be turned on with a Shabbos clock or a timer (see next point), one may not place inside any food which is not completely cooked. Furthermore, even completely cooked food that has cooled down may not be placed inside either, unless the food is completely dry (and will remain dry when heated). The same applies to an oven which will remain off but has  not yet cooled down.
2. With regards to Shabbos clocks in general, the Rebbe writes in a letter (Igros Kodesh Vol 12 page 192): “There are those who are extremely stringent and are even skeptical about the permissibility of using a Shabbos clock… Therefore, I am abstaining from giving this idea in an official capacity.” Even so, it is reported that the Rebbe instructed some individuals that they may be used (See Shulchan Menachem Volume 2 page 173). At the same time, many authorities who permit Shabbos clocks in general nevertheless rule that they should not be used with regards to cooking specifically, for a number of reasons.

This is generally easy to achieve, as the Sabbath Mode feature can usually be set to turn the oven off in any increment amount of time up until 72 or 96 hours. So, you can easily set the oven to go off after 2 or 3 hours, for example. Once the oven is off, opening the door does not create a problem with regards to the thermostat.
However, this method will usually create a new problem, which requires its own workaround. Now that the oven is off, this means that Sabbath Mode is now deactivated as well, and opening the door will turn the light on (if the oven has a light). This can be circumvented before Shabbos by manipulating the magnets or levers that detect whether the door is open. The specific manner of circumvention will vary from model to model, and in the case of magnetic detectors, may take some trial-and-error. Some oven doors are designed to be taken apart to allow proper cleaning of all the glass panes, and the magnet can be physically removed from the door. In other models, it may work to place a strong and thin magnet on the oven wall at the correct place. (The location of the oven’s magnet can usually be detected by sliding a paperclip around the top of the oven door.) These options may or may not work, depending on the model, so you would have to try before Shabbos, when you have the time and patience to troubleshoot it. [Note: Disabling the magnetic sensor only helps with regards to the functions controlled by the door sensor, such as the oven light and fans. However, the thermostat is not controlled by the door sensor, which is why the oven needs to be off before opening the door on Shabbos.]
Following the advice above, when Shabbos is followed by Yom Tov, one would have to choose whether to reserve the oven’s use for Shabbos or Yom Tov, as using it on Shabbos would require the oven to be set to turn off on Shabbos, in which case it will remain off for the duration of Yom Tov as well.
The Issur of Shehiya with regards to an oven:
The above answer focuses purely on using the oven itself. However, there are also restrictions about which foods may be placed in an oven before Shabbos without a Blech, and much discussion about whether, and how, a Blech can be facilitated in an oven. Here is a brief summary of the issues:
From the Torah perspective, one may place food over an open flame before Shabbos in order that it cooks on Shabbos. Nevertheless, Chazal forbade this due to the concern that a person may come to stoke the fire on Shabbos in order to speed up the cooking process. This prohibition is known as Shehiya.
One method of avoiding Shehiya is to cover the flames, typically with a Blech. Covering the fire indicates that one does not desire a strong flame, it diverts his attention from the fire, and it serves as a reminder not to increase the flames. With regards to an oven, there is a dispute whether – and how – a Blech can be adequately created. In practice, a Blech in an oven should be situated so that it covers the heating elements, which may be located either at the top of the oven, the bottom or the back-wall. In many ovens, there are heating elements in all of these places.
Another way of addressing Shehiya, and to sidestep the need for a Blech, is to ensure that the food is cooked prior to Shabbos. It is sufficient if the food is already half cooked.  This fraction does not represent time, but rather, is qualitative and measured against the degree of cooking most people would regard as fully cooked. Nevertheless, for a number of reasons, it is best that the food be fully baked before Shabbos.
There is yet a third possible way to circumvent the prohibition of Shehiya. Chazal allowed one to put completely raw meat on an open flame just before the onset of Shabbos. They were not concerned that one might come to stoke the flames, because doing so would not serve any productive purpose – it would not ready the meat in time for the Friday night meal, nor would it be necessary to ready the meat in time for the Shabbos day meal. This leniency is known as “Kidra Chaysa” – literally: raw pot. (Indeed, some people may wish to put raw chicken and rice right before Shabbos to slow bake in the oven for the daytime Seudas Shabbos.)
In order for this leniency to apply, two criteria must be met. First, the food item must be one that takes a relatively long time to cook properly (such as meat). Second, the food must be put on the fire just before Shabbos, late enough that it will not begin cooking before Shabbos comes in. Some contemporary Poskim therefore assert that this leniency seldom applies nowadays, because most modern cooking appliances are able to cook in a relatively short amount of time. As a case in point, meat put up to cook right at the onset of Shabbos would usually be fit for consumption by the time the meat course  arrives. Even if the heat is set to low, this does not diminish the oven’s overall ability to bake quickly, because the seat heating can be easily raised. Thus, according to these Poskim, this option is not applicable to a modern oven.
Other associated issues:
1. It should be pointed out that even when the oven is off and cold, if it will be turned on with a Shabbos clock or a timer (see next point), one may not place inside any food which is not completely cooked. Furthermore, even completely cooked food that has cooled down may not be placed inside either, unless the food is completely dry (and will remain dry when heated). The same applies to an oven which will remain off but has  not yet cooled down.
2. With regards to Shabbos clocks in general, the Rebbe writes in a letter (Igros Kodesh Vol 12 page 192): “There are those who are extremely stringent and are even skeptical about the permissibility of using a Shabbos clock… Therefore, I am abstaining from giving this idea in an official capacity.” Even so, it is reported that the Rebbe instructed some individuals that they may be used (See Shulchan Menachem Volume 2 page 173). At the same time, many authorities who permit Shabbos clocks in general nevertheless rule that they should not be used with regards to cooking specifically, for a number of reasons.

The custom is to have a curtain always covering the Aron Kodesh’s door. This is not only to beautify the Aron Kodesh but a sign of modesty.

"I know the minhag of many is Not to make kiddush between six and seven. This was what I remember my custom in my parents home. My question is, sometime this leads to stress in the house either rushing through Sholom Aleichim to get on time and rushing from shul home. On the other hand we have a house of young children at home and waiting till seven can lead to chaos some times. Kids are impatient and hungry. In addition we have guests and this can add pressure. Is there room to be maikel on this custom?","
Although this minhag is brought in the Alter Rebbe’s Shulchan Aruch (271:3), it is a minhag and not a Din. Chazal teach us that great is peace, for the whole Torah was given only to make peace in the world. Accordingly, the mitzva of sholom overrides this minhag. Furthermore, we find that Shalom Bayis outweighs the entire mitzvah of kiddush, for, according to halacha, if one cannot afford both Shabbos candles and wine for kiddush, he should buy only candles since they are there for the purpose of Shalom Bayis.
At the same time, It is highly recommended that one do their best to explain to family members that this is our minhag and the significance of observing minhagim, especially a minhag mentioned in Poskim. In fact, some consider this an issue of potential sakanah which is often deemed more serious than matters of issur. Generally speaking, observing Torah customs bring about more peace and stability in the home and shouldn’t cause conflict. The conflict usually stems from an inadequate presentation and packaging of the issue. If the family perceives the significance of this issue, they would fully appreciate your behavior.
Obviously, if despite all attempts to present things in the proper manner it still appears to cause stress or tension, or if it affects the atmosphere in the house (,), then one definitely should not wait.
When Kiddush is made within the hour wait time it should be made immediately upon arrival home from shul, with as least delay as possible.
Alternatively one may make kiddush before going to shul, even before dark. Although this is not the usual Lubavitch minhag, it is preferable than making Kiddush during the hour.
Guests – the Rebbe writes that this minhag applies even in the event of guests, since it is a sakana issue. However it is still restricted to what I wrote above.
Children – children do not need to wait for kiddush to eat, not even for chinuch. Most likely the situation can be ameliorated somewhat if they are given something to eat until kiddush is made. In fact, if they are hungry one is not allowed to stop them from eating.","###question

" A home, with a full Kosher kitchen, had Goyim working there as home attendants during a span of several years. Do all the dishes need to be Kasherd?
A home had goyim and not observant yidden working there as home attendants (one at a time) throughout the day and night during a span of several years.
In this home, there was a kosher kitchen with multiple cabinets and closets of many pots, pans, utensils, etc. In addition to the workers’ being instructed not to touch any dishes, throughout the years of this situation, there were always family members coming in and out at random hours of day and night checking up (although there may have been some shifts/days during which no family members came, but they were never informed if/when family would show up). Sometimes residing extremely close by.
In more recent times, there were also cameras installed. Despite that, there were several times (not many) which certain workers (of which there were various, different years brought different ones, but only one at a time) were caught using a utensil or about to use one. It remains unknown if there many other such instances in which they weren’t caught. Though it would have possibly been noticed if a utensil was left out.
Please note that they weren’t authorized to cook and so there was no cooking taking place. There was a kettle which they used to make hot drinks for the kosher patient and perhaps for their own food.

"My wife had a shorter veses haflaga kavua. She has now established a longer veses haflaga kavua without three consecutive clean occasions at the shorter veses. What is the current status for the shorter veses kavua? Does she need to keep both, or just the longer? If just the longer, under what circumstances will the shorter resurrect? Upon one occurrence or three?
The basic point is that she first saw after 49 clean periods, and never had an opportunity to take that off the calendar because she always saw before then. Over the following years, she established a veses haflagah kavua for 48 clean periods. However, on 18 Tammuz in the day, she saw again after 49 periods, so that made two times for after 49 clean periods. in the next two months (Av and Elul) she saw after 47 clean periods, even earlier than the 48 veses kavua. In Tishrei she saw even earlier after 45 periods. Then in Cheshvon, she saw again after 49 periods, for the third time at after 49 periods.
So, to sum it up, she hadn’t seen three times clean after 48 without at least one occurrence of after 48 in the middle, but still saw three consecutive times after 49 clean when presented with that opportunity.","
The first haflagah of 49 became uprooted once she established the shorter veses kavua. Therefore she only has two haflagos of 49 and has not yet established a new kavua.","###question

 Is it permissible to go paintball shooting?,"It is important to point out that if this is regarding a camp activity, then whatever written further below has no bearing on what should be done in camp. The purpose of this answer is not for staff members – in contrast to the director – to take this answer and make a Balagan in camp with it. The camp has their Rav who they ask their Shailos to, and that is what is to be followed in the camp B’Poel Mamosh. 
According to Halacha, one should not hit oneself nor shall he hit anyone else even if he gives permission, for it is not his body to give permission to hurt (and an Issur D’Oraysa might be involved).
Some Rabbonim permit paintball shooting as a school or camp activity to encourage learning and/or proper behavior (i.e. as a trip for for good learning) – similar to the concept of hitting a child to help his learning.
Others argue that it is only Assur to hurt someone if done in a harmful manner, however, since paintball shooting is done in a friendly manner there is no Issur involved. Nonetheless, this Heter should only be used if it is L’Toieles.
Indeed, tackle football is regularly played in many otherwise religious schools and camps. However, there is an obvious distinction since here there are guns used for shooting and hurting, while tackling is not officially to attack.
While these arguments might justify the Minhag to be lenient, there is strong room to adopt a stringent approach, as per the straightforward reading of Halacha (referenced below).
I would add that if we don’t steal the Afikoman, which is a Minhag because it involved stealing, even though it’s only a game, we definitely shouldn’t shoot other Yidden and hurt them, even as a game. It appears to be very against our Shito. As mentioned, camps must formulate a policy with their local Rav on this matter.

Your son need not move away every Shabbos if it involves a great tircha. You may come for Shabbos in the case where your presence is deemed a great need, or if it is considered a mitzvah. Certainly, if you assist with shlichus activities over Shabbos there you may attend for Shabbos. In such a case, it is not only permissible but also commendable.

" What is the minimum of Challah one can eat and still be able to wash & Bentch?
I try to keep the minhag of melave malka every week, including washing. Sometimes it’s hard to eat a lot after having eaten recently at the Shabbos meal…
What is the minimum of challah/Matzah one can eat and still be able to wash/bentch?
Over the years I’ve seen many different places where there is a weight amount or, worse yet, a description such as “kazayis” or “kabeitza” to describe food shiurim, and those leave a person very confused as to the exact amount of food. Would the Rav be so kind as to describe the size of a piece of challah or the amount of matzah (usually box Square Matzah)? (E.g. The amount of challah comparable to a golf ball or two golf balls etc or a different item that the challah could be measured against).
Additionally, does the shiur consist of only the hamotzi food, or could something that’s put on top of the challah/matzah also count as part of the shiur? (Let’s say if someone puts egg salad or tuna salad on challah, can this be counted and this way one eats let’s of the actual hamotzi food but can nevertheless still wash and bench).
And finally, is there a time frame in which one needs to eat the shiur?","
One must wash (without a Bracha) and make Hamotzi for even the smallest amount.
One must wash with a Bracha if he’s planning on eating a K’beitza. This is approximately 2 K’zeizim. Each K’zayis should be eaten within K’dei Achilas Pras (= 4 minutes) and without pausing between the two of them.
One must make a Birchas Hamazon if he ate a K’zayis of bread within 4 minutes. Other foods do not count for this amount.
If 4 minutes proves to be too difficult, one can be lenient and eat it within 6 minutes but should eat approximately the size of 1/3 of a K’beitza within 4 minutes. If one is not sure if it was eaten in the right amount of time – if he is satiated, he should still make a Birchas Hamazon.
Torah measurements are usually volume-based, not weight. A K’zayis is the approximate volume of half an average size egg. A K’beizah is the volume of an average size egg. Nonetheless, for simplicity, they have been converted to weight measurements, although the weight measurements are far from accurate. This is because different foods with an equal volume weigh differently. The following is the weight for water; bread and certainly matzah weighs less. For a K’beitza this is approx. 53.8 gram or 1.89 oz. For a K’zayis, approx. 25.6 gram or 0.90 oz.
One-third of a standard square machine matza is approximately a K’zayis. With bread, it is harder to measure, as they are not uniform but it is approximately the size of what would fit into a small l’chaim cup. In order to be safe, one should err on the side of caution and eat slightly more than the shiur, due to a number of reasons, among them since some crumbs remain between the teeth.

I’ll start off with an anecdote:
A man was stuck on his rooftop in a flood. He was praying to G-d for help.
Soon a man in a rowboat came by and the fellow shouted to the man on the roof, “jump in, I can save you.” The stranded man shouted back, “no, it’s OK, I’m praying to G-d and he is going to save me.” So the rowboat went on.
Then a motorboat came by. The fellow in the motorboat shouted, “jump in, I can save you.” To this the stranded man said, “No thanks, I’m praying to G-d and he is going to save me. I have faith.” So the motorboat went on.
Then a helicopter came by and the pilot shouted down, “Grab this rope and I will lift you to safety.” To this the stranded man again replied, “No thanks, I’m praying to G-d and he is going to save me. I have faith.” So the helicopter reluctantly flew away.
Soon the water rose above the rooftop and the man drowned. He went “upstairs”. He finally got his chance to discuss this whole situation with G-d, at which point he exclaimed, “I had faith in you but you didn’t save me, you let me drown. I don’t understand why!”
To this G-d replied, “I sent you a rowboat and a motorboat and a helicopter, what more did you expect?”
And now to answer your question:
The Torah instructs us to protect our lives in every way possible, spiritual and physical. Obviously, in the event of physical danger r”l, in addition to applying spiritual protection, we must do all we can to protect ourselves in a physical way, following standard security procedures. (This should be discussed with the local security agencies, police department, etc., in conjunction with the local Rav/Shliach).
One can ask the same question regarding Hashem’s protection in general: we are promised that “the guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps”. Should that mean that we should not apply physical protection as well? Should a Jewish soldier not wear a helmet? Obviously not.
So too in regards to mezuzah: we are taught that the mitzvah of mezuzah brings longevity to those who keep it, and even more –  it provides protection to the house and its residents (even when they are outside of the house), and to all Yidden throughout the world. However, in the event of physical danger r”l, we must apply physical protection in addition to making sure we have kosher mezuzahs affixed to our doorposts. This does not in any way imply that the mezuza is an insufficient measure of protection, rather, that Hashem will help our standard security procedures in the merit of the mezuza.
We find a similar idea regarding parnasa: while the Torah teaches us that it is Hashem’s blessing which gives a person parnasa, everyone understands that this blessing needs a “vessel” in which to rest. For someone to say that he won’t work because he is relying on Hashem’s Bracha is foolish and wrong. So too we must take natural measures in security issues, and one who refrains from doing this is held responsible.
A story to illustrate: there was a chosid who experienced a break-in to his vehicle and asked the Rebbe (amongst other things) if he should check his mezuzas. The Rebbe answered that he should make sure the vehicle is locked at night.","###question

Scientifically: It is highly debatable whether scientifically there is any health advantage to this practice. See for example here.
Halachicly: I’ll focus only on the halachic aspect. Eating placenta per se is problematic according to Halacha as human flesh is forbidden to be eaten. It might also fall under the category of mi’us. (Note that customarily placenta used to be buried – certainly not eaten).
A leniency could be justified only for sick people who need medication. Nonetheless, when ground and encapsulated there is more room for leniency.
However, being that this isn’t a “recognized cure” (refuah yeduah) it’s not so lchatchillah. If there are other alternatives available, or if it’s not really that important, one shouldn’t use this method.","###question

 Does one need to ask a Rav before being induced? Is there any Halachic issue?,"
This matter is discussed in a number of Poskim. The general rule is that one may not induce or rush the onset of labor unless there are clear medical reasons to require it. Some of the reasons for this prohibition are because:
There is a level of risk inherent to childbirth, and one should therefore not hasten it even though it is bound to come.
The special assurance of protection Hashem provides at the time of childbirth does not necessarily apply to the same degree if the birth is hastened without a clear medical need.
The procedures and/or medicines involved in induction can themselves cause complications, and one should not take that risk needlessly.","###question

 There is a prohibition to Kovaya Seuda before davening in case they might forget to daven before the zman tefilla, however, one is allowed to snack on fruits and other foods and eat bread or mezonos up to a beitza (2 kzaysim).
Before Shacharis, one may not eat at all. If not eating disturbs one’s kavanah in davening, one may be lenient to eat before Shacharis. Chassidim would be particular to eat before Shacharis in such cases. But since the purpose was not to be kovaya seudah they would ordinarily eat mezonos and not bread. Bichlal, one may not eat more than a kebeitza. Generally, Mashpiim in Lubavitch preferred mezonos over bread.
Q. Is there a difference between men and women?
A. There is room to be meikel for a woman since there is an opinion that woman can fulfill their chiyuv of Tefilla with a short bakasha, a request of Hashem, in the morning."
 Article: Do I have to fast?,"The most stringent of all fast days is Yom Kippur, since fasting is min haTorah (a Biblical law), as the passuk in Parashas Acharei Mos says: “Ta’anu es nafshoseichem” (afflict your souls)—and the severe punishment for not fasting is kareis (early death by Divine decree). Only a heter (dispensation) dispensed by a rav in critical circumstances and in a strictly prescribed manner would allow breaking the fast. A choleh she’ein bo sakanah (a person who has a non-life threatening illness) and similarly, a woman who is expecting or nursing (under normal circumstances), must fast.
Four other fasts are rooted in divrei kabbalah (the words of receiving, i.e. from the Prophets): Tzom Gedaliah, Asara B’Teves, Shiva’a Asar B’Tammuz and Tisha B’Av, and they are subject to stricter rules than for other laws mi’d’rabbanan (of Rabbinic origin). (Taanis Esther is in a different category of minhag—custom.)
Tisha B’Av, due to its history of huchpalu bo tzaros (double tragedies), is more stringently observed: We begin fasting at sunset the evening before and observe the additional bodily afflictions as on Yom Kippur. But the other three fasts of divrei kabbalah are more minor; they were instituted for calamities associated with the churban (destruction [of the Temple]) and during times of relative peace afterwards were commemorated only as a standing tradition previously accepted by Klal Yisroel (the Jewish people).
One of the leniencies of these three fasts is that an expectant or nursing mother who is mitzta’eres harbeh (in much physical discomfort) does not have to fast. Poskim state that lav davka (not necessarily) must the discomfort be acute—even some difficulty suffices as a heter. By contrast, a choleh she’ein bo sakanah, and similarly, an expectant or nursing mother who is suffering undue weakness or one who is at a stage of her pregnancy where fasting is deemed unhealthy for her (or for the fetus) and would therefore be considered a choleh—is patur (exempt) from fasting on all four fast days, including Tisha B’Av.
A mother of small children who is not expecting or nursing is not included in this heter, and neither is one who is paid to care for others’ children, as there is hardly a career or calling that exempts an individual from the halachic obligation to fast. One halachic opinion states that women should not have to fast for twenty four months after giving birth (the official halachic time span for nursing) and another exempts all those of childbearing age, but these views are rejected by mainstream poskim.
There is some extra leniency regarding Tzom Gedaliah (compared to the other two fasts of divrei kabbalah) for those who are not otherwise exempt, but would not be physically able to fast on Yom Kippur only one week after fasting on Tzom Gedaliah. In such a case, a rav should be consulted.

" Is Quinoa Kosher for Pesach?
I am very confused about this. All the years I’ve heard that most poskim maintain that quinoa is considered kitniyos. Now I am hearing that there is new information on the topic and that is been agreed that it is not kitniyos.
May I use it on Pesach or not?","
The common consensus of most poskim on this topic is that it is considered kitniyos for all practical purposes. The few kashrus agencies that are authorizing it are pushing this product on the market—and even they maintain that it needs a reliable proper hechsher as it might have some grain mixed into it—but that does not change the consensus within mainstream halacha.
Explanation:
The key argument to permit quinoa is that this is considered a new type of food which wasn’t around when the decree against kitniyos was made and thus it is not included in the original prohibition against kitniyos.
This argument has been repeated many times about different things. However, klal Yisroel has not accepted this argument. The custom is not to use peanuts, and more specifically — corn, even though these foods were not around then.
In fact, the original poskim who mentioned the prohibition against kitniyos do not list the various type of foods. The basic assumption is that anything that has the properties of kitniyos is included. Furthermore, from the extensive discussion in poskim about why potatoes are permitted on Pesach it is clear that the fact that this was a new food was not germane to the discussion.
Quinoa has all the properties of kitniyos and all the reasons mentioned in poskim apply just as much if not more to quinoa. Certainly, it has more similarity to grain than corn does.
It should be noted that even though Rabbi Moshe Feinstein has ruled to permit peanuts, he agreed that corn remains forbidden. His son Rabbi Dovid Feinstein states clearly that the same applies to quinoa. (The arguments to distinguish between corn and quinoa based on its Yiddish name and its high popularity are a far stretch and inconsistent with the position of Reb Moshe himself. It is obvious that Reb Moshe’s position to allow peanuts is not based on the sole factor of it being a new food. He explained elsewhere why corn remains forbidden because it fits well with the general criteria of kitniyos, unlike potatoes and peanuts. Accordingly, in his opinion quinoa should be forbidden. As mentioned this is also the position of his son, Reb Dovid.)
The classification of quinoa as kitniyos applies also the other areas in halacha. With regard to the rules of kilayim for example, it is clear that quinoa is considered kitniyos. There’s no reason to make any distinction when it comes to this very important minhag, which many poskim, including the Tzemach Tzedek, state that it applies even during times of hunger. A proper understanding of the Alter Rebbe words in Shulchan Aruch leads us to this conclusion too.
To the best of my knowledge this is also the position of most Chabad Rabbonim the world over. The position that quinoa is unacceptable as kitniyos is shared by many many contemporary poskim. To name just a few: Rabbi Elyashiv, Rabbi Neubort, Rabbi Shlomo Miller, Rabbi Usher Weiss, Rabbi Westheim — and many other well known kashrus agencies. (For a through treatmet of this matter, see Kovetz Etz Chaim, vol. XXVIII).
The very fact that all those who permit quinoa warn strongly to use it only if it goes through a proper certification process because of the serious concern that it might have a mixture of other grains is telling. Indeed, one of the reasons for the original prohibition against kitniyos is this very fact that it often mixes with other grain.
In conclusion: there’s no reason to change our behavior this year than all previous years. The minhag to forbid kitniyos is an important one and should not be dropped for convenience reasons, without a consensus that a particular food isn’t included. There are many other alternatives for healthy food on the market for Pesach.","###question

  Were the Rabbeim pro religious Zionism?
Were the Rabbeim pro Zionism? Or more specifically religious Zionism? Someone from Anash just told me that there is a Chiyuv to rebuild the Beis Hamikdosh when the Jewish people have control of the Temple Mount. And that by not having control of the mountain, we are halting Moshiach. What about speaking Ivrit?.
 ###answer 
 
Thank you for contacting AskTheRav. We have received your question.
Please note that AskTheRav receives many questions from our visitors every day. We strive to answer these matters of practical Halacha in an efficient manner. Therefore, we ask our visitors to limit their questions to those of practical Halachic nature rather than learning style research questions, so that we can spend our time serving you best with your Halachic questions.
Regarding your question: The Chabad position re Zionism is very nuanced. An excellent summary can be found here, and here.
Regarding the usage of Ivrit, see here 
Regarding taking control of the mountain, Jews have complete control over that area. As for an obligation to build the Beis Hamikdosh on Temple Mount, this is actually one thing where the Rebbe was very clear on this matter. The same as virtually all gedolei Yisroel, the Rebbe was firmly opposed to any such talk and maintained that Geulah can only come about through Moshiach, and he is the one who is to instruct on building the Beis Hamikdosh.

"I accidentally made a Bracha on Rabbeinu Tam Tefilin thinking they were Rashi’s tefillin. If I concluded davening in my Rabbeinu Tam Tefilin should I make another Bracha on my Rashi’s?
In addition, if I davened shacharis with my Rabbeinu Tam Tefilin closer to chatzos, is there an inyan to wait with my Rashi’s tefillin to daven mincha Shmonei Esrei with them given that I only said Shema with them?","
There are various opinions about what is to be done in such a case. The accepted opinion is that if he remembers immediately after he put on the Rabbeinu Tam tefillin without having made any interruption, he should put on the Rashi tefillin right away without making a new Bracha.
However, if he interrupted, even by saying words of davening, then he should take off the Rabbeinu Tam tefillin and put on the Rashi tefillin with a Bracha. Nonetheless, since there is a difference of opinion among poskim, it is recommended that in order to avoid this questionable situation one should make a definite interruption, such as going to the bathroom; after doing so, all poskim agree that he can then make a Bracah on the Rashi tefillin.
It is recommended that after davening one should put back on the Rabbeinu Tam tefillin and recite the customary prayers if he has not done so yet.
If one has already said shema etc. there is no need to put back on the Rabbeinu Tam tefillin, however, it is recommended for various reasons.
If one davened Shemone Esrai already, but didn’t daven Mincha yet, it is recommended – but not required – to daven Mincha in them. (one should not however delay this, lest he forget to put them on).
Remember to say sheish zchiros.","###question

" Is one allowed to donate blood (or plasma), when its going to Goyim? Should one donate?","Regarding donating blood to a fellow Jew, it is clear that just as we must help a Jew monetarily, and we must even inconvenience ourselves to help, we must also go through the small discomfort involved in donating blood.
Regarding donating blood to a non-Jew, most rabbinic authorities of the last generations have approved of this, and so is the common practice.
Some of the explanations given:
Since there is reciprocal benefit to the donor, either personally due to having donated, or to another Jew because there is enough blood to go around. Even if the Jews’ blood ends up in a non-Jew, the fact that there is more blood in the bank can help save the life of a Jew. Even more so, when there is even a 1% chance that it will end up in a Jew. (We are taught that it is a mitzvah to violate the Shabbos to save a Jewish life even if the majority odds are against him).
Additionally, the blood is not going to a specific person, rather to a bank which will help many individuals (including Jews) who the donor does not -and will not- ever know.
It is also understood the tremendous Kiddush Hashem which is caused by the publicity that Jews are spearheading this plasma drive, and are from the leading donors, as opposed to the tremendous Chilul Hashem which would be caused if it was known that Jews do not donate blood to general blood banks. For the same reason, medical personnel are permitted (nowadays) to violate the Shabbos to save a non-Jew.","###question

 I am learning to be a EMT. Am I allowed to read the necessary materials on Shabbos?,"Yes, they may be read.
Explanation:
The Alter Rebbe brings two opinions on the matter, but writes (307:31) that the custom is to be lenient. A G-d fearing person would however be stringent. However, in this case, since this is a matter associated with a Mitzvah there is no reason to be stringent. See also references here:
My therapist recommended I read some books, however I don’t really have the time to read them during the week. Am I allowed to read them on Shabbos?
Note however Alter Rebbe’s Shulchan Aruch 290:5:
“The Shabbasos and the festivals were given to the Jewish people solely so that they occupy themselves with Torah study on these days.” (This applies particularly to working people and also to those that learn all week).
See also Kuntres Eitz Hachaim from the Rebbe Rashab end of chapter 25:
On Shabbos more than during the week, we must utilize our time for holy purposes and not wasteful activities. Even eating, drinking, and sleeping should be done to honor Shabbos, for that is when our weekday activities are elevated.
How this applies to you, the need to finish the material (upcoming test), etc, can be discussed with your mashpia.","###question

When someone was overcharged in a transaction, they have limited time to claim a refund. (In this case you may be able to claim that you delayed because you were asking a rav what to do). Of course the seller can choose to refund the buyer if later, and the buyer can choose to forfeit their money.

However it is very possible that there is a glitch in their computer system or labeling and many other people are also being accidentally overcharged. You would be doing the store owner and others a favor by notifying him and he can choose to refund you.","###question

Is it any different for lemons and garlic?
Can I put the salad in a plastic serving bowl that was clean and not used for a year but was washed with a fleishig sponge back then?
Answers:
For regular vegetables, it’s not advisable to do so,
For lemons, onion, garlic, it is prohibited, You can buy a cheap knife to cut your salad.
Permitted but not advised."
"We are writing a Sefer Torah and we would like to keep it in our house when it is done. What are the Halachos about that? We do not have a specific shul to give it to right now.
What are the rules of keeping a Sefer Torah in the house if we won’t really be using it for Krias HaTorah generally?","
Firstly, keep in mind that a shul you choose to give the Torah to is only considered a “loan” and you may take it back whenever you want. Also the traditional celebration “Hachnasos Sefer Torah” is usually done when the Torah is going to be brought to a shul so it can be read from in Minyanim.
In any case, the following is the guidelines to having a Sefer Torah in a home:
One must have a designated and set place for the Sefer Torah. This place should not be in a couples bedroom nor should it be in a room directly under a bathroom or a couples bedroom. If the Sefer Torah is in your home temporary, you may be lenient and keep the Sefer Torah in a room directly under the bedroom (if there is a real need); however, you should still be careful not to keep it under a bathroom.
Since one must act respectful and may not turn your back and the like in front of a Sefer Torah, the Torah should be put in a Aron Kodesh or a cabinet with doors which are 32 inches tall and it is best to add a second partition (a solid one, not a paroches/curtain, unless you fasten also the bottom of the curtain in a way which would prevent it from moving), however this is not an obligation. There is also a custom to have a curtain in front of the Aron Kodesh.
It is customary for the Torah to be in an upright position (standing, as opposed to lying down).
If at the time of the torahs arrival one does not yet have a partition etc. with which to cover the sefer torah as explained above, then the torah should be wrapped in two covers (or taleisim) for the time being, at least 32 inches off the ground on a shelf that is at least 13 inches by 13 inches wide.","###question

" Can a few women split the daily Chitas between themselves?

Splitting up the chitas is not the ideal method, since you as an individual will not have completed the above. There is however some merit in it, since you, as part of a group, will have it completed (similar to the division of Shas has done on 19 Kislev, although as noted, this was not the original takana of chitas).
I suggest that in addition to splitting it among your friends, you also try to learn just the Chumash without Rashi, or to cover a certain amount throughout the day and complete the rest at a later point.The same can be with Tehilim (first kapital) and Tanya.","###question

" Should I be washing my baby Negel Vasser properly?

We’ve been washing my baby Negel Vasser since he was born. Since he is so little and moves around many times his Negel Vasser doesn’t cover the whole hand and is not done perfectly. Also he sleeps multiple times a day.
Do I need to wash him every time he wakes up and make sure it’s a perfect Negel Vasser before he touches food?
In other words what is the age where I have to actually begin worrying about the tumah on his hands and be stringent, as opposed to now, when it’s more preferable and more for Chinuch?","
If you are accepting upon yourself this added stringency, you should ensure that the baby washes Negel Vasser exactly as an adult should, and make sure water reaches the entire hands.
However, this stringency does not necessarily include washing after every times your baby naps, as even food that is touched by an adult who takes a nap by day is permitted to be eaten.
For those who do not take on this added stringency, Halacha mandates to be careful regarding touching before Negel Vasser for a child who has reached the age of Chinuch, approximately 6 or 7 years old.
To add clarification, this Hiddur mentioned in Poskim isn’t due to the Mitzvah of Chinuch. Although as Chassidim we know that Chinuch starts from the youngest age – and even earlier, Halachically, Chinuch doesn’t start until a child is already “the age of Chinuch”. Thus, even according to those opinions that things done for Chinuch can be done ‘symbolically’ without all the details (a subject of itself with many parameters), this Hiddur when observed should be kept with all the details.","###question

If the folding prepares the garment for weekday use it also shouldn’t be done on Shabbos. However, if the folding is done as part of organizing the home, i.e. there is no room for the garments and they are taking up space, and for whatever reason one couldn’t do this before Shabbos, one may fold them on Shabbos, not on the original fold lines."
 Is cotton Tzitzis kosher according to Halacha and could you make a Bracha on it?,"
When one wears a woolen four-cornered garment, he is certainly fulfilling a Mitzvah Min Hatorah. However, when one wears a cotton four-cornered garment, there is a dispute as to whether he is fulfilling a Mitzvah Min Hatorah or Miderabanan. That is why it is generally preferred to wear woolen four-cornered garments, and this is Minhag Chabad.
Another dispute concerning a cotton four-cornered garment is whether one may attach to them Tzitzis strings made out of wool, or whether the strings must be made of cotton. The Alter Rebbe confirms that the custom is like the lenient opinion, but adds that every G-d fearing person should nevertheless be stringent and use only cotton Tzitzis strings on a cotton four-cornered garment. It must be noted that cotton Tzitzis strings are not commercially manufactured at present, which means that all cotton four-cornered garments available for purchase use woolen Tzitzis strings, and are thus not the ideal way of performing this Mitzvah.
In such a case of wool tzitzis on the cotton garment, a Bracha should ideally not be made on the tallis katan. However, there is room to justify the practice of those who make a bracha on it. (The Alter Rebbe says only “nachon hadavar”, not an issur. He doesn’t use the regular lashon of safek brachos lhakel, as we don’t hold that way, and it’s only a chumra. Furthermore, b’pashtus it’s only talking about when he has another proper tallis shel tzemer. In any event, the Alter Rebbe says that the minhag clearly is to put tzemar tzitzis in meshi. And in the place of a minhag, we don’t say safek brachos lhakel).
For both of these reasons, the Alter Rebbe states that one who wishes to keep this Mitzvah in the best way should ensure that both the four-cornered garment as well as the Tzitzis strings are made of wool.","###question

 Do filter bags need to have a Hechsher since they are going into soups?,"The filter bags don’t need to be kosher but you must be sure that no bugs can leave the bag.
As for the idea of using such bags to prevent the need for checking: With foods that are certainly infested, one should not do this, but we need not admonish those who do, provided the garment is thick.
Where the food is not definitely infested, it may be done but one should check and clean first superficially.
Explanation in brief:
The bugs that are in the unchecked herbs would give off a bad taste to the soup and would be inconsequential (any non-kosher food that gives a bad taste to a kosher food is called Pagum and doesn’t make the kosher food non-kosher).
Even though one may not intentionally nullify something that is forbidden, here your intention is not to nullify the bugs but rather to add the taste of herbs to the soup.
Even if there is a remote concern that the bugs might have left the bag, we may assume that the bugs stayed in the bag, and even if they left the bag there is an assumption that the bugs became crushed during the cooking process and therefore could be nullified in the soup.","###question

I’m not sure where you heard that. None of us can say with certainty that we know why tragedies happen. It’s true that Torah tells us that when tragedies happen we need to examine our behaviors and see which things require rectification. However, that does not mean that human beings can fathom the ways of Hashem and say that they absolutely know which particular behavior caused this particular tragedy. Even great tzadikim who are sometimes privy to the inner workings of Hashem in this world have many times stated about themselves that they cannot understand the ways of Hashem. Certainly, it is not our job to explain why certain things occurred.
As for your specific question about unfiltered internet: it is absolutely true that this is forbidden according to the Torah. The psak against unfiltered internet has been expressed by almost all Rabbonim from all circles (Chassidic, non-Chassidic, the so-called Modern Orthodox movement, etc.).
Whether such behavior is actually killing people I cannot claim to know, but I do know that it wreaks havoc on a person, his family and immediate surroundings.

The tragedies caused by unfiltered internet, whether on a personal level, or the harmful effects on a marriage or a relationship, or on one’s connection to Hashem, are very real and are serious, and shouldn’t be underestimated. Thus, the correct thing to do is to immediately obtain proper filtering on your devices and protect yourself and your family. One thing is for sure this will bring great Bracha to yourself and to your loved ones. Just for this reason alone, it’s worthwhile to do so without delay.

May I cut my hair and nails after chatzos (midday)?
Sifrei Kabbalah (Holy writings of Kabbalah) relate that the Arizal would refrain from having his hair cut after midday. Some are of the opinion that the same would apply to cutting nails. The question is: what was the reason for this custom?
If it was because we shouldn’t engage in any new melachah (work) once the zman (time) of Mincha has arrived—lest we be distracted from davening Mincha—then we can assume that there is no issue with cutting our hair after having davened Mincha. Nails, however, may be cut even before davening Mincha.
However, if the reason was that according to Kabbalah the forces of dinim (Heavenly judgment) begin gaining strength after midday, it would be cause to refrain from doing so throughout the entire afternoon, and in fact more so at night, when the dinim are even more severe. Although the influence of the forces of dinim is mentioned specifically only regarding haircuts, it can arguably be applied to nail cutting too.
Common practice, though, is that we do take haircuts and cut our nails after midday—provided that we have davened Mincha—and at night as well. Likewise, If one has a fixed minyan for davening Mincha, one need not refrain from engaging in melacha prior to davening.","###question

If it was because we shouldn’t engage in any new melachah (work) once the zman (time) of Mincha has arrived—lest we be distracted from davening Mincha—then we can assume that there is no issue with cutting our hair after having davened Mincha. Nails, however, may be cut even before davening Mincha.
However, if the reason was that according to Kabbalah the forces of dinim (Heavenly judgment) begin gaining strength after midday, it would be cause to refrain from doing so throughout the entire afternoon, and in fact more so at night, when the dinim are even more severe. Although the influence of the forces of dinim is mentioned specifically only regarding haircuts, it can arguably be applied to nail cutting too.
Common practice, though, is that we do take haircuts and cut our nails after midday—provided that we have davened Mincha—and at night as well. Likewise, If one has a fixed minyan for davening Mincha, one need not refrain from engaging in melacha prior to davening."
 May one substitute a shower for Negel Vasser in the morning before saying Asher Yotzar?,"We are required to wash our hands upon awakening in order to remove forces of impurity that cleave to our bodies during sleep, as well as in order to purify ourselves to serve Hashem and pray. Following washing, we recite a blessing (“al netilas yodaim”) followed by “asher yotazr” and the subsequent morning blessings.
The forces of impurity do not leave until they are washed 3 times with a cup, thus a shower does not suffice.
However one should remove the impurity as soon as possible, but not recite a blessing until taking care of one’s bodily needs, thus the proper sequence should be: Modeh Ani, washing of hands without the blessing (many wash before getting out of bed), bodily needs, shower, washing of hands with a blessing.

 May a man Tovel in a river on Shabbos?,"One may Tovel in a river on Shabbos if it’s for the purpose of Mikvah.

One should not place his clothes and towel four Amos away from where one is Toveling. Right when coming out, one will be able to dry themselves without walking four amos with water on their body.

 If one has no more clean undergarments can laundry be done during 9 days? Is it better to buy new ones?,"One may not launder clothing during the 9 days. If all clothes have been worn and one has no more clothes one may only launder during the week before Tisha B’av.
Thus, according to the strict halacha one may not wash even undergarments, even if all were already worn and he has nothing to change into, after Shabbos Chazon.
Nonetheless, if one is exceptionally in distress (and not merely uncomfortable), one may do as follows:
Undergarments which are changed every day – it is better to buy new ones and put them on the earth or dirty floor before wearing. If this is not possible, one may launder them and place on floor as above. However, if you can have a non Jew launder it, that would be better than buying.
Other clothes (jackets, pants, skirts, etc.) – if they are soiled to the extent that one is embarrassed to walk outside with them, one should not buy new clothes, but may launder one set only and place on floor as above. As above, best to have a non Jew launder.
Shirts (that also get sweaty) – if they are soiled to the extent that one is embarrassed to walk outside with them, or so sweaty that it causes distress, one should not buy new clothes, but may launder one set only and place on floor as above. If difficult, one may launder the bare minimum amount that is absolutely required and place on floor as above.","###question

" I had a baby a few days ago BH. I am not nursing. Someone told me that within 30 days of giving birth, one doesn’t have to fast. Is that accurate?","Within the first thirty days of giving birth, the new mother (whether nursing/not nursing) is usually held in the category of “Chole”: exempt from fasting.
However, if the birth was natural and the mother is fully healed and feeling well and the fast won’t cause her any harm, she SHOULD fast. This is because Tisha B’Av is the most stringent Rabbinical fast, due to its history of huchpalu bo tzaros (double tragedies).
Of course, if she is feeling faint, unusually weak, dehydrated, dizzy or feverish etc. she should break her fast and can eat normally.","###question

You should wait and walk in with someone else who is already opening the door for themselves.

"I want to place bars of sweet-smelling soap as a drawer freshener inside dresser drawers. Would I then have a problem opening those drawers on Shabbos? It’s just a plain, fragrant bar of soap sitting in the drawer. It doesn’t spray anything. I would open the drawer to take out items I need on Shabbos.
I understood from halacha I’ve learned that if there are Muktza items in a drawer together with items I need on Shabbos, I would need to have something like a bencher in the drawer in order to open it.

I’ll try to give a brief overview:
When a muktza item is placed (purposely, before Shabbos) alone on top of a non-muktza item, it may render the non-muktza item as muktza as well. This is called “bosis l’dovor ho’assur” – a base for a forbidden item.

Based on this:
If your drawer has medicine (or anything else) that is of higher value/importance than the cream, it is no problem to open on Shabbos. Same applies with the soap.
It should be noted that one may not create a good smell on Shabbos if the purpose is the good smell (as opposed to just getting rid of a bad smell). Thus the fragrant soap should not be placed there on Shabbos.","###question

In general, it is inadvisable to use canvas even for one of the walls and even if it is firmly secured, because the center sometimes moves back and forth in the wind even while tied, and because the ropes sometimes loosen without anyone noticing and then the sukkah walls are no longer considered to be strong enough to withstand an ordinary gust of wind, as required by halachah.
Therefore, a sukkah using canvas or sheets should have bamboo sticks or beams placed horizontally along the walls for the first ten hand-breadths from the ground, with a space of less than three hand-breadths between each beam. As a first recourse, these beams should be set up on all four sides of the sukkah. Some Sukkahs are equipped with such poles.
The sukkah itself must be strong enough to withstand the normal wind. As such, a pop-up sukkah which is lightweight should be secured well.
Make certain that the s’chach is placed in such a manner that it is able to withstand ordinary gusts of wind throughout the entire festival of Sukkos. This is of particular concern when using a bamboo mat for s’chach. (If using mats, ensure that they are kosher for s’chach).
One may not open or close the sukkah on Shabbos or yom tov. The same applies to the schach which cannot be placed on Shabbos or yom tov.","###question

Question clarified:
We paid for a service through Paypal and were advised to send payment as friends to avoid the transaction fee. This option was not available and we had to make the payment right away so we sent it through regular PayPal. The seller is now asking us to pay for the fee. According to Paypal, the seller is responsible for the fee. What is the halachic view on this?","
Disclaimer: the following discusses the halachic components, not the legal ones.
If the seller – or service provider – didn’t stipulate anything in advance, the fee would be on the buyer, as per the PayPal guidelines. If he stipulated to avoid the fee and the buyer made the transaction with the fee, the fee is on the buyer. In other words the price was minus the fee. Had the seller intended to pay the fee, the price would have been higher to include it.
(There is no aspect of ribbis in this case [See Beis Efraim Y.D. 41.Mayim Rabim 38. Mishpat Ribis 20:8. Bris Yehuda ch. 22 fn. 6].)
In this case where there was a specific request to pay as a “friend” it is equivalent to a stipulation. On the other hand, it appears from your account that there was a request to submit the funds right away regardless of the stipulation. This matter requires further clarification.
The Halachah is that a Dayan (a judge in a Beis Din) may not listen to one litigant in a Choshen Mishpat (financial) dispute unless the other litigant is present—ze bifnei ze. Thus, we cannot provide a definitive answer in this case.

Nonetheless, in a situation where it is not possible to face each other as it would cause a woman pain, there is room to permit to have relations facing her back.
Regardless of the above, one may only have relations in the vaginal opening, and not in the rectal opening. As well, one must assure that there is no concern of Zera Levatola – wasted semen.

" When I make a Bracha on a cookie or drink in my home, how long does this Bracha “last for”?
Question Continued:
If a bit later on, I decide to drink or eat something that would require the same Brachah?
Also, what is the time frame within which I can still say a Beracha Achrona?","
Beracha Rishona:
If you had the second food in mind when making the Beracha, and have not consciously decided to stop eating, you may continue eating until you have “lost the Beracha” (discussed later).
If you didn’t have the second food in mind (L’chatchila you should always have in mind the possibility of eating more):
▪ If you want to eat more of the same food (i.e. a second apple) and have not consciously decided to stop eating, you don’t make another Beracha.
▪ If you want to a different food from the same food type (i.e. apple then an orange), and you still have part of the first food (apple) in front of you, you don’t make another Beracha. But if you have finished the apple, you should make a second Beracha on the orange.
▪ If you want to eat a different type of food that has the same Beracha (i.e. eggs then fish), you should make a second Beracha even if the first food is still in front of you.
If you consciously decided to stop eating, you need to make another Beracha even on the first food.
Beracha Achrona:
The following are guidelines for when you “lost” the Beracha Achrona (and Beracha Rishona).
▪ If “the food has digested”. This is determined by the fact that you are hungry again (or thirsty – with regard to drinks). So long one intends to continue eating, the food doesn’t digest.
▪ If you cannot determine this (typically when eating very little like a snack) and 11 minutes have not yet passed, you can still make a Beracha Achrona. If you want to continue eating, you may do so.
▪ If 11 minutes have passed, you should eat a kezayis of something else which requires the same Bracha Acharona, which you didn’t intend eating and make a new Bracha Rishona and then make a Beracha Achrona. If you don’t have anything else, you should eat more from the same food without a bracha and then make a Bracha Acharona. If you have none left, you shouldn’t make a Bracha Acharona.
Because of the complexity of “losing” the Beracha Achrona, you should always make a Beracha Achrona right away, especially when eating very little.

" What should I do about Toiveling a dish if I can’t get the sticker completely off? Is it a Chatzitzah?
I have something I need to toivel but the label sticker won’t come off all the way. is it still a chatzitzah or can it be toiveled any way?","
Ideally, one should remove all the stickers or labels from the dishes before the tevila.
However, in a case where the stickers are covering only the minority of the dish and it is in such a manner that most people don’t mind its presence, one may toivel the dishes with the stickers on, if removing them would be a big hassle. If on occasion one minds its presence it’s considered a chatzitzah (intervening substance), and must be removed.
For example, if the sticker is underneath the utensil, we could assume that people aren’t concerned with using the dish while the sticker is underneath.
Labels which contain instructions for usage need not be removed.
Stickers which make the utensil look more expensive, such as a brand name, or if it is there for beauty, need not be removed.
Once one started removing the sticker, it should be removed completely, as people often mind when there is an incomplete sticker or leftovers from a sticker. The glue which remains after the removal of the stickers is not an issue if it has no substance, i.e. it is not felt when touching it. If it does have substance, it must be removed if people mind its presence.","###question 
  What should I do about Toiveling a dish if I can’t get the sticker completely off? Is it a Chatzitzah?
I have something I need to toivel but the label sticker won’t come off all the way. is it still a chatzitzah or can it be toiveled any way?.
 ###answer 
 
Ideally, one should remove all the stickers or labels from the dishes before the tevila.
However, in a case where the stickers are covering only the minority of the dish and it is in such a manner that most people don’t mind its presence, one may toivel the dishes with the stickers on, if removing them would be a big hassle. If on occasion one minds its presence it’s considered a chatzitzah (intervening substance), and must be removed.
For example, if the sticker is underneath the utensil, we could assume that people aren’t concerned with using the dish while the sticker is underneath.

 Medical professionals recommend taking activated charcoal pills for certain stomach conditions . Do these pills require a proper hashgacha?,"Charcoal in itself, is not an issue if it’s vegetarian. The same holds true for the capsule.
When vegetarian is not available:
If a physician / medical professional has advised taking Activated Charcoal due to pain that may sometimes be severe, tasteless – unflavored – pills may be taken.
You may look into getting from Israel with Badatz of Eida Hechsher, or perhaps from Boro Park at KosherVitamins.com.
Explanation:
Non Vegetarian Activated Charcoal Pill can also be made from non-Kosher ingredients, as Bone Char etc. The same applies with the capsule, as it could be made with Gelatin etc.
However, since it’s burned out, not edible and tasteless, we may be lenient in a case of a Chole She-ayn Bo Sakono, which includes strong pain that can be alleviated by taking this pill.
The reason we have not suggested taking the powder out of the capsule is because this particular medicine will thereby lose the effectiveness, and additionally, the capsule is tasteless. (It should be noted that the tablets without the capsules might have a taste, and therefore it is best to use those with the capsule).
All the above applies for a patient with pain experiencing difficulty obtaining Activated Charcoal Pills that are vegetarian or ones with a Hechsher.

In conclusion, unless you meet all the above requirements, it cannot be done.
See also the following excerpts from our Day to Day Halachic Guide:
MOBILE SUKKAH
A person who is traveling without access to a Sukkah, can create a Sukkah out of a vehicle (or two), as follows:
LOCATION
The spot you choose should be semi-secluded, and not on a public path where it would interfere with foot traffic. It should also be a safe, crime-free area, where you would technically be able to sleep at night. It should also fulfill the other requirements for the positioning of a Sukkah – the area above the s’chach free of tree limbs or overhangs
ASSEMBLY
Use the front and back door of a single vehicle (on the same side) or open a single door on mirroring sides of two vehicles. (The interior of a convertible or roadster that fits all the dimensions below can be used as well.)
The area created by the three sides (either the two doors and the one car body, or the two car bodies and the adjacent doors) has to be at least seven tefachim long and seven tefachim wide (about 22.5 inches on each side).
The doors must reach ten tefachim (3.25 feet) in height and start no more than three tefachim (9.5 inches) off the ground. Parking near a curb and opening the door(s) over the curb will help in this regard.
The doors must be fully and firmly open, so that a gust of wind will not slam them closed.
ROOF
It is preferable not to prop the s’chach directly on the car doors, but to first place wood laths or the like across and the s’chach on top of that. The s’chach should be fixed to the “roof” with jute twine or string (not zip ties) so that it will not blow away.
The above is set up in such a way that the “walls” of the Sukkah are adjacently perpendicular to the s’chach. If there is an area of four amos (six feet) of car roof on any side of the Sukkah or four tefachim (13 inches) of car roof or other unkosher covering in the middle of the Sukkah, it is unusable.115 If the mobile Sukkah is of the smallest possible size (seven by seven tefachim), any three-tefach span of car roof – whether in the middle or on the side – will invalidate it.
USE
You must hold your food or put it down on a table or surface inside your makeshift Sukkah. You may not eat under the s’chach and use the seat in the car (outside your Sukkah) as your table.
You must stipulate that the vehicle(s) will be able to be used for (non-holy) purposes after the Sukkah is dismantled, since, as stated above, we are usually not allowed to use the parts of a Sukkah for another purpose once they were used for a mitzvah.","###question

" Can we take pictures of our 3-year-old daughter lighting Shabbos candles for the first time?
Can a photo be taken while we are lighting but before the Bracha is over? 
I was planning to light about a half hour early to make sure there is no risk of going into Shabbos.","
Strictly speaking, Halachically, there is no issue.
However, it is better for many reasons (and perhaps more practical) to take the pictures before she lights the actual Shabbos candles, i.e., you can set up different candles and have her light them and take pictures of that.

A few points to note:
1. One may only light Shabbos candles after the Zman of Plag Hamincha.
2. Once a woman lights the Shabbos candles (after the above mentioned time), she automatically accepts Shabbos (together with all its laws) upon herself.
3. Our Minhag is that a girl begins lighting Shabbos (and Yom Tov) candles even before she turns 3; as soon as she’s able to say the Brocho(s).
4. The Rebbe suggested that a girl should start lighting candles for the first time on a Yom Tov, so that the Bracha of Shehecheyanu can be valid for (the Yom Tov itself and for) the lighting of the candles as well. Alternatively, when lighting for the first time on a Shabbos, the girl should wear a new garment and recite Shehecheyanu for the same purpose (i.e., so that the Bracha can ‘go’ on the lighting in addition to the new garment).","###question

Firstly, yes, a Tanya should be treated like a Chumash in this regard (the Rebbe was seen removing Tanya’s from atop Chumashim and vice versa).
Regarding a Chitas, it should be treated like a Chumash or Tanya, because all one-volume compilations containing Seforim with various levels of Kedusha are treated like the most Kadosh Sefer they contain. Therefore, one may place a Chitas atop a Chumash or Tanya (as it contains both), but not the other way around (as it would be like placing a Tanya over a Chumash, and vice versa).
[Since you mentioned a Siddur, it should be noted that its Kedusha is comparable to that of Neviim, Kesuvim, and Torah Shebaal Peh. And unlike a Chumash and Tanya, they each may be placed atop one another.]","###question

There is this “instant pot” (pressure cooker appliance) that has its heating element in the lid of the pot, for air frying. The way this lid is designed means that it can never be absolutely cleaned, unlike the lid of an ordinary metal pot. (The pot itself can be cleaned.) 
If this lid is used to cook meat, for example, would one have to consider whatever is cooked subsequently in that pot with that same lid to also contain meat? And is it an issue to subsequently cook fish in that pot with that lid?.
 ###answer 
 
If there is actual meat residue there it would be an issue."

According to Halachah, a wax candle is considered to be a wick in a wax container. Technically, there is no need to insert the candle into a holder—a Menorah.
Nevertheless, Chazal tell us that mitzvos are to be performed in a beautiful manner, in the spirit of Zeh Keili ve-anveihu (“This is my G-d and I will glorify Him”) and this extends also to the rabbinic mitzvah of Chanukah. It is therefore important to obtain a beautiful menorah, ideally made of metal.

" Are people allowed to deny a Kohen his Aliyah?
I have seen the seder of aliyos “Kohen-Levi-Yisroel” being disregarded way too many times, especially on Shabbos before Yud Shvat and Simchas Torah, when everyone wants an aliyah. There is no question that if there are no Kohanim or Leviim present there should be no issues, but otherwise, are people allowed to deny a Kohen his aliyah? As a Kohen, I felt bothered by it many times. Why should the Halachah of the Shulchan Aruch and a mitzvah of the Torah be disregarded for a minhag? As a Kohen, should I stand up for myself or let it go?
If there is a halacha issue to deny the Kohen his aliyah, perhaps there should be a public reminder of this issue?","
As a Kohen, you have no obligation to stand up for your aliya as it is the mitzvah of the congregation to honor the Kohen and not your mitzvah. On the contrary, you should give your permission so that those that need an aliya can receive one.
As a general rule, the first aliya should be given to a Kohen if there is one in shul and it should not be disregarded as it is a Mitzvas Asei.
At certain set times, this was not kept for the benefit of the community such as making money for the shul and the like. But this should be done only if there is such a set Minhag in place.
Also, when there is a great need, there is room to be lenient and call up a Yisroel in the place of a Kohen, but only with the full permission of the Kohen and without disregarding that he is a Kohen (i.e. they should not say “Ein Kan Kohen” – there is no Kohen here when he is actually in the room). This is especially true by mincha shabbos afternoon and by the kriah of Monday and Thursday, where there is more room for leniency.
In practice, in a regular Shul one should not call up a Levi or Yisroel in the place of a Kohen (when there is a Kohen present) unless there is a great financial loss for the shul and/or many chiyuvim, and even so not on a regular basis, the Kohen should give his full permission and leave the Shul,
In a Shul like 770, this should still be maintained, but the Kohen would not have to leave the Shul.","###question

"When using a towel as a scarf to go to the Mikva on Shabbos, does it need to be wrapped around the neck or does it suffice to just have it hanging down? Some people do wear scarves without wrapping them.","
Firstly:
One may only use any towel as a scarf in a place where people wear scarfs in the winter. In warmer weather when no one ever wears a scarf – it should not be that big of a towel. Also, a very thick towel is problematic.
Additionally, if the towel is damp and dirty (such as after going to the Mikvah) and it would be hard to imagine that anyone would use it a scarf, there are those that are stringent.
In regards to the specific question here:
The usual “way of wearing” a scarf is wrapped around the neck in some way or the other.
Many people go outside with a scarf hanging around their neck – for instance, if it’s not that cold and may be cold later (or was cold earlier) – but that would be considered “way of carrying” and not “way of wearing”.
P.S.: A lady may go out with a shawl wrapped around her even if it’s not fully wrapped, because that is considered the “way of wearing” for her.
Follow-up Question:
What about a man wearing a nice scarf to just put around the neck? Would that be allowed for a man without tucking it in, as it’s allowed for a lady?
Answer:
Yes, if it’s worn due to the weather.

" Hachnasa L’Cheider After School Hours?
Does a Hachnasa L’Cheider require to have children present or is it perfectly fine doing it with the Melamed after school hours (after the children in the class went home)?","
Although there is no specific recorded Minhag that the Hachnasa L’Cheider is required to be in the presence of other children, since it should be done in a festive way (like carrying golden dishes…) and in a form of celebration (in the child’s eyes as well) it’s sensible to say that it should be done when other children are there, as this is usually the case when there are other children present including them in the festivities.
As general rule: The customs associated with Hachnasa L’Cheider are very precise and addressed in detail in many Seforim, and even in Rishonim. Poskim also admonish us not to deviate from these customs as we don’t know all the reasons for the specific customs. Accordingly, since the common practice is to do it in the presence of other children, it is not recommended to change the common custom, as we don’t know whether this is b’davka or not.

"I got this pillow: one side is silver sequins and the other is sequins that make up a picture. Am I allowed to use it, touch it, flip it on Shabbos?","
The Poskim discuss opening and closing books with writing on the sides of the pages. The Alter Rebbe (340:4) records two opinions in this regard – the Levush who prohibits it on account of writing and erasing on Shabbos, and the Remo who permits it because the letters are already written and in close proximity, and it is possible to bring them close together easily without doing any new action. The Alter Rebbe states that the custom is to be lenient, and so rules the Tzemach Tzedek (Masechta Shabbos 12:44).
Even so, the Ketzos Hashulchan (144:3) asserts that this leniency is primarily about when one finds himself in such a circumstance on Shabbos. However, one should not print such books in the first place. Similarly, if one owns such a book, he should cut the letters off before Shabbos so that he is not faced with this situation on Shabbos.

P.S. The above is regarding sequins that make up a pre-existing picture. With regards to sequins that when flipped just change their color, flipping them would be permissible according to all opinions.

However “writing” something new on the pillow (only flipping some of the sequins to make up a new picture or letter) would be prohibited according to all opinions."

"Is it more preferable to prepare Chanukah candles by oneself then buying ready made ones, and if it is: what if the ready made ones burn nicer?","
There is no halachic requirement to prepare the wicks yourself, though some are particular to do so for various reasons (see references in Hebrew below). Clearly, if the ready-made ones burn better they are halachically preferable.
Note however that often the ready-made ones might have other deficiencies in terms of various Hiddurim (though some of these hiddurim are questionable as there are many who maintain that there is really no significant benefit in doing so). For example, there are those who are particular to use only extra virgin olive oil (and some opine that it must be edible oil as well). Other hiddurim are: using oil that is liquid not gelled, using wicks that are not coated, using old wicks, amongst others.
Besides the above-mentioned it’s preferable that there is a hechsher confirming that everything is genuine and kosher.","###question

We do not have all the information necessary to be able to decide who is right here, and only a Beis Din that heard the arguments of both sides would have the possibility to decide this matter.
Nonetheless, here are several observations about the matter in general:
1. It’s very strange that there is no mention of Halacha in this letter, only about the civil law as it has been been determined in the secular courts.
2. Regarding the actual ownership of  Chabad literature, this is an old debate which to the best of my knowledge has yet to be determined in a properly constituted Beis Din. (If my recollection serves me right, I believe the court itself ruled recently in that it does not belong exclusively to any party. Nonetheless, as mentioned this has no bearing on actual halacha).
3. On the other hand, while the Torah is in favor of disseminating Torah teachings as wide as possible and the Rebbe encouraged publicizing such matters wherever and whenever one can, so long as it doesn’t cause encroachment on other’s rights and cause financial harm (hasagas gevul), obviously no one may take the law into their own hands and do as he pleases without permission and approval of a higher authority, whomever that may be. This is not only to to potential matters of hasagas gevul, but also because there has to be the proper acharayus to ensure things are done properly. While the Rebbe was very much in favor of spreading Yiddishkeit, he wanted things to operate in a seder mesudar, and would not allow a situation where everybody does what they want and how they want. There were many instances where the Rebbe decried the actions of individuals, particularly bachurim, who published kuntreisim etc., but without the proper oversight or approval from those in authority.

What does the Rov say?,"
Everything that happens is Behashgacha Pratis.
The only things that aren’t decided by Hashem are a person’s choices. However any consequences that would happen to another individual as a result of those choices would fall under the general rule that everything that happens in this world is decided by Hashem.
Bearing this in mind, there is never a legitimate reason for getting upset at someone for something he or she did to you, for in truth nobody can affect you in any way that Hashem hasn’t pre-planned for you. Hashem has many messengers for his plans and if it weren’t for this individuals action it would happen through someone else’s action or in some other way.
Also the Mishnah (Avos 5:6) teaches us that one should always judge another favorably and should never jump to conclusions.
Obviously every individual on their own have the responsibility to make responsible choices, since their own choices aren’t pre-planned by Hashem. (And when making a mistake they are to take responsibility for their actions).

" Is a girl that was raped still considered a virgin, spiritually?
If someone was raped at 4 years old and at 12 years old, are they still considered a virgin? I know physically they are not. But spiritually are they? And are they from a Jewish view?","
No, she does not lose the purity associated with virginity. This is because the Torah does not attribute any of it to her, only to the rapist – equaling it to murder. However this may impact her in terms of eligibility to marry a kohen. If the issue comes up, it should be discussed with an expert rov. Additionally, it might how her Kesuba should be written – which would only be known to the husband and two witnesses- and should be discussed with the Rov that is Mesader Kidushin.","###question

 Can one give a LGBT person a Aliya or let them be Chazzan?,"Obviously a biological woman will always stay a woman and one may not give them an Aliya or let them be Chazzan regardless of how they look or dress.
A biological man that looks like or dresses like a woman shouldn’t either be given an Aliya or to be Chazzan – or even sit in the men’s or women’s sections while dressed so (see the link below for additional details) – due to the issue of Maris Ayin and other issues.
A gay or bisexual man who lives with another man should be treated like any other person that is not Frum. He may receive an Aliya or be Chazzan as long as he isn’t defiant about his weakness and it won’t be perceived as giving a Hechsher to his actions.
For additional clarity, we bring you here a free translation of a letter of the Rebbe on a related topic:
Regarding an Aliya to the Torah for individuals that it is not clear how their observance in Torah and Mitzvos is … My answer is that the decision in this matter depends on many details, both in regard to the conduct of the individual who wants to receive an Aliya to the Torah and in regard to those who pray in the Shul and the way they will perceive it. In all matters which are done in public, these issues need also be brought into consideration. And in fitting with what was mentioned, only those who are locals are able to decide. However, it is understood that based on our Sages axiom, “always the right hand should draw closer and the left hand…” one needs to address this question too this way. And specifically when there is a doubt if at all one needs to even push with their left hand, for it is already mentioned, “its ways are pleasant ways and all of its paths are of peace…”

"My friend and I are working on an app that will allow someone to give Tzedaka the maximum frequency throughout the day. So, if “Shalom Aleicha Rebbe” (3 seconds) is the shortest time unit between each time to give Tzedaka, and there are 86400 seconds in 24 hours, And 1 pruta= 1.25 cents, would it be: 86400/3=28,800 opportunities to give 1.25 cents: 28,800*.0125= $360?
This could enable a lot of people to give Tzedaka in the maximum possible way, but we want to make sure that this is true according to Halacha.","
The Mitzva of Tzedaka is very special as it hastens the Geula, and those that are involved in helping others give, have a great Zchus.
In regards to an app, anything that will encourage and facilitate the giving of Tzedaka is great. Here are a few thoughts regarding the specific method you mentioned:
Although a Prutah is commonly considered the lowest amount of value, this does not necessarily apply to Tzedaka and even 1 penny suffices – see here:
How many coins to give to Tzedakah before Davening
2. The benefit of giving Tzedaka multiple times throughout the day – discussed in Tanya section of Igeres Hakodesh – is that a person is consciously doing the physical act of Tzedaka many times.
3. The above benefit is meant to result in giving more Tzedaka and not delaying it. In other words, if one is giving $10 to Tzedaka, they should not give it bit by by, rather they should give it as early as possible. What the above mentioned benefit is meant to accomplish is, that if one has $1 they should give it and not wait until they can give a larger sum.
It is questionable if the above points are achieved through to an automated app, although the Mitzva is definitely being done – see here:
Is giving Tzedakah through an app the same as putting coins into a pushka?
It should be noted that every time you donate to Tzedaka by using a credit card, Tzedaka will only end up getting a percentage of the actual funds. It is obviously better to give them a direct wire or a check which usually means that Tzedaka will receive more.
Also, if there would be many credit card transactions there would be a credit card transaction fee every time. Either it should be a bank transfer or it should be charged in bigger chunks.","###question

" I turned on the hot water in my sink on Shabbos by mistake, may I turn it off or must it stay running the whole Shabbos?","It would depend on the type of water heater. One would have to determine how their specific water heater works.
There are two main types of heaters: tank heaters and tankless/instant-on heaters.
With a tank heater:
If your heater doesn’t refill unless the water level is below a certain point and you are certain that the water did not hit that point, you may close the hot water tap.
But if the heater refills as soon as any water leaves (usually this is the case), then when you close the tap you are causing the fire or electricity to turn off earlier (as it has to heat up less water). Even in this case, however, if the water was on only briefly or it was just dripping, it would not cause enough cold water to replace the water and cause the heater to go on, and you may straight away close the tap.

"Recently, a friend of mine said this isn’t right and I should rethink it. What does Halacha say about what I should/shouldn’t be doing?","
It is self-understood that the concept of ‘Baalei Batim’ belonging to any individual or Mossad, is an incorrect logic. The same holds true with offering a Yid to put on Tefillin (in case Ch”v he did not put on that day) or suggesting to a Woman to light Shabbos candles in a town where there is a Shliach or a Rav of the Community. No one can come with a Taana (claim), “why did you take away my Baal Habos? He should only put on Tefillin with me, the Shliach!” Or “I am His Rabbi!”.
The same would hold true with Mivtza Tzedakah. If your taking of the donation is in no way minimizing their donation to the local Shliach or to any local organization, in such case there is no reason to refrain from being Mezake another Yid with Mivtza Tzedakah.
And Aderabe (on the contrary)– you might even inadvertently assist that local Shliach, as it is common sense that the more a Gevir donates the more Tzedakah it leads him to giving!
On the other hand – If this donation will cause direct damage to the Shliach or any local organization, then it is unacceptable. The Rebbe very much desired that Shluchim should not “step on the toes” of others, especially other Shluchim and that all activities be done in an achdus manner. At times, it could also be an issue of Hasogas Gevul!
Therefore, it really depends on the situation, the donor’s intention and so on.
These nuances should be evaluated beforehand. In general, it’s always a good idea to discuss the issues with the local Shluchim and coordinate activities. There are many letters of the Rebbe along these lines.
Certainly, if the donation is given specifically because you are ‘Chabad’ and due to this their donation to the Shliach will be less, or if the donor is unable to give more than he gave you, (since he gave you a Chomesh etc.), in these (and in similar) cases, you must first discuss it with the local Shliach.","###question

" Are undiscernible Sheitels Kosher?
Recently a new type of Sheitels hit the market that are basically undiscernible, you really cannot tell that this person is wearing a Sheitel and definitely not from afar, (it has a lace front, meaning it makes it look like the hair is growing right out of the head, so the white scalp (or skin color) after that looks like the persons head, so if you don’t look closely, it doesn’t look like the person is wearing a Sheitel).
Is this allowed? and what is the Rebbe’s opinion on this?
Also, even if a Sheitel doesn’t have a lace front, making it look like hair growing out of the head, is it ok for ones Sheitel to have a white scalp (I know many people who ask the Sheitel Macher to add more hair so the Sheitel doesn’t bear the look of growing out of the head) so it looks nice, but still evident that its a Sheitel?","
It’s not a concern of mar’is ayin, since it’s well known that religious women wear shaitlach. Certainly, if this type of sheitel becomes common there’s no need to be concerned.
However one must ensure that the lace-front (or lace-top) is not see-through at all and that one’s scalp and hair are completely covered (by having a fabric sewn in on the inside or the like).
See more about this here:
Are Lace Top Sheitels Kosher?
This is usually only an issue with a lace front sheitel (where the lace is only on the front of the shaitel) and one needs to put powders or a band so that one shouldn’t be able to see the hair. A lace top shaitel has a lace on the whole shaitel so usually in order to make it look more natural they put a white lining under the lace so no hair is usually seen.
However, one must ensure that the lining is truly opaque and that the lining extends to the very front where the actual hairline is. It’s not enough to ask the Sheitel macher to ensure that the Sheitel is “kosher”, as there are different types of linings and one must ensure that it is in accordance with Halacha.
Many of the linings sewn in the sheitels available in the market are inadequate as the scalp can be seen through it and one might need to have another lining added.","###question 
  Are undiscernible Sheitels Kosher?
Recently a new type of Sheitels hit the market that are basically undiscernible, you really cannot tell that this person is wearing a Sheitel and definitely not from afar, (it has a lace front, meaning it makes it look like the hair is growing right out of the head, so the white scalp (or skin color) after that looks like the persons head, so if you don’t look closely, it doesn’t look like the person is wearing a Sheitel).
Is this allowed? and what is the Rebbe’s opinion on this?
Also, even if a Sheitel doesn’t have a lace front, making it look like hair growing out of the head, is it ok for ones Sheitel to have a white scalp (I know many people who ask the Sheitel Macher to add more hair so the Sheitel doesn’t bear the look of growing out of the head) so it looks nice, but still evident that its a Sheitel?.
 ###answer 
 
It’s not a concern of mar’is ayin, since it’s well known that religious women wear shaitlach. Certainly, if this type of sheitel becomes common there’s no need to be concerned.
However one must ensure that the lace-front (or lace-top) is not see-through at all and that one’s scalp and hair are completely covered (by having a fabric sewn in on the inside or the like).
See more about this here:
Are Lace Top Sheitels Kosher?
This is usually only an issue with a lace front sheitel (where the lace is only on the front of the shaitel) and one needs to put powders or a band so that one shouldn’t be able to see the hair. A lace top shaitel has a lace on the whole shaitel so usually in order to make it look more natural they put a white lining under the lace so no hair is usually seen.
However, one must ensure that the lining is truly opaque and that the lining extends to the very front where the actual hairline is. It’s not enough to ask the Sheitel macher to ensure that the Sheitel is “kosher”, as there are different types of linings and one must ensure that it is in accordance with Halacha.
Many of the linings sewn in the sheitels available in the market are inadequate as the scalp can be seen through it and one might need to have another lining added."

If it laid eggs at least 21 days after this incident happened, the eggs are kosher. Otherwise, all the eggs born from this hen would be problematic, and you would have to separate them.

" What is the correct position during Tachanun?
While covering the head with the arm during Tachanun; is the head supposed to be touching the covering, or not actually touching only covering?","
There are many Halachois & Minhogim regarding specifics of Nefilas Apayim.
Among them:
Nefilas Apayim requires one to tilt their head slightly upon their arm which is covered in a garment (sleeve, tallis, etc.). In this manner, their face is also covered.
One should ensure that the head is tilted towards the arm and not the reverse where the arm is raised toward the head.
One shouldn’t fall in their hand, nor upon the arm without a separation or cover.
One should not just cover the forehead but also make sure the face is partially hidden from the ground below it.
However, it’s not clear whether the head needs to touch the arm or garment. I haven’t seen this specification mentioned.
It appears that the Rebbe would not lean on his arm, though during Shacharis at times he would touch his holy face with his Talis. During Mincha, the Rebbe’s sleeve would (usually) not be touching his face.

" Can I date a girl in a private home in Crown Heights? How would I go about Yichud?
Here are the conditions:The house is owned by an older couple who are vacationing out of town. Around five of their adult children (who all live in Crown Heights) have keys to the house. Some of them do go in once in a while. One of them goes in at least once a day, at any given time. Besides, there are two tenants living in the basement.
May I date there? Is opening a window shade facing the street enough?

What if the doors between the house and the tenants are opened? What if the tenants are told about the date? What if they are told to go upstairs every once in a while? (and how often would that have to be)? Does it make a difference what time it is? At what point is it considered “Libo Gas Bah” (this is the third date)?","
If it is during the day, or the early hours of the night (when there are still plenty of people on the street), it would be enough if the door (in the room they are in) is opened to a reshus harabim, assuming it’s normal that people could enter in such a situation.
Opened windows to reshus harabim, would only work if you are constantly sitting in a place that is seen easily from outside.
In extenuating circumstances, you can rely on the relatives (at least 3) having access, and would conceivably visit during this time.

Are you allowed to open food packages on Shabbos?

Take off the plastic from chummus or cream cheese packages,
Open a bag of pretzels, Bissli, etc.
Take off the cover from a yogurt
Open the plastic from individually wrapped pieces of sliced American cheese
Obviously besides being careful not to cut the words…","
One should avoid opening or separating a bag/container sealed with glue, such as the items you mention in the question.
There are some lenient views when the item being opened is disposable and will be thrown away immediately (Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasa 9:4). However, it is the preferred approach to be stringent in this matter due to the concern that separating two pieces of paper or plastic stuck to each other is an issur of koreia (ripping). See Shulchan Aruch Admor Hazaken (Orach Chayim 340:17). See also Nesivim Bsdei Hashlichus vol. 2 p. 101 in the name of Rav Zalman Shimon Dvorkin Z”L.
A simple alternative would be to make a cut from the side, provided that you are not ripping any words or pictures.
This is only if it’s sealed with glue, but if it is just plain heat sealed – which is very common with today’s packaging – there won’t be an issue (especially with disposable packaging), though it’s still preferable to open it before Shabbos.
Follow up Question:
Is there a way to know which packaging is heat-sealed and which is glued? How are chips bags sealed, for example?
Answer:
I can’t say with certainty. However, if upon opening you see a thin layer of dried glue or any other sticky substances you would know it’s glued. In contrast, potato chips and most bags are usually heat sealed.","###question

If however, you do eat all together afterwards, a new bracha should not be made, and zimun should be done. Reciting shir hama’alos however isn’t considered a decision to bentch.
B. When two people come together to join one person, there is no chiyuv to do zimun, however, if one wishes to do so they can make zimun as long as he would technically be able to eat something together with them."

" What should I do with this Mezuzah?
I went to acquire a collection of Jewish books at a residency in Manhattan earlier this week. The library is comprised of both Jewish and Christian books amongst many radical theological and anti-Semitic and Jewish conspiracy theory propaganda books.
I didn’t meet the owner of the books, but I understand he’s Jewish and from what I can tell has been affiliated with JW as well as other Christian groups. I was told he also went to Shul, but I haven’t verified whether that is indeed the case.
On any note, amongst the Seforim I found a reasonable-looking Mezuzah and my question is what the status of this Mezuzah is. Can it potentially be used and if not how is it to be disposed of?","
The Halacha is that one is in fact obligated to buy STA”M from a non-Jew who has them in his possession, to prevent it from being disgraced (although this may not be required in the case of a Jew – because he usually will not disgrace them). They should be bought even beyond their regular price, but not if overly expensive.
If one did buy them they should not be used, and should be placed in geniza (shaimos), as many times they have been written by unqualified people. Even when purchasing such items in general one must only purchase them from a G-D fearing individual, all the more so when the origins are unknown.

" I left a bottle of wine on my desk overnight, Can I use it?
Full Question:
I left non mevushal wine in an open brown bag on my desk in school overnight. There are non Jewish janitors that clean the room each day after everyone leaves.
Can I use the wine or should I throw it out?","
If the wine is still sealed, or if it certainly wasn’t touched (and seen) by a non-Jew (i.e., it is clear that it remained inside the bag the entire time), it is permissible.
Otherwise, if it’s known that the wine was touched by a non-Jew, it should not be used and it must be discarded.
If it was merely seen by a non-Jew, it is permitted, but some have a stringency not to use it for kiddush or other kos shel bracha. Many chassidim practice this stringency. Others are particular not to use at all.

" Must/Should One Pay His Mashpia?
Hi,
I just heard that there is a perspective that people should pay their Mashpia for the time that they spend talking with them.
Is this true in halacha or it’s just someone’s perspective?
I feel that my Mashpia would laugh if I said I’m going to pay her, and besides- what if the need for payment would create a deterrent for calling? What about all the back payment from previous years? Or if I switched Mashpia’s already? How would I know how much to pay? Would it be allowed to come from Ma’aser?
I don’t feel like halacha would say I need to pay, it’s too open-ended. Maybe it’s a noble thing to do, but I need to know what it actually is according to halacha.
Thank you very much!","
Halachically speaking, the Mashpia may choose to request payment for sessions and it’s within their halachic rights. On the other hand, one does not have to pay their Mashpia for their time if they don’t request it and it isn’t taken for granted. Nonetheless, it may be a appropriate thing to do, depending on if one can afford it, the financial needs of the Mashpia, and how much time the Mashpia dedicates to this etc.","###question

 How do I clean my Braces when Erev Pesach is on Shabbos?,"Here are a few excerpts from our Halacha guide:
Thursday: Denture wearers who are scrupulous, should not eat or drink any warm or sharp chametz substance for a twenty-four hour period prior to kashering their teeth (which should be done on Friday).
Friday: Young  people with non-removable braces, or those with bridgework or implants should avoid all hot and sharp chametz foods for twenty-four hours beginning this morning at 10:55 am. Prepare boiling water for Shabbos, which will be used after cleaning teeth well before the chametz end-time on Shabbos morning, and then “kashering” their braces or bridges by drinking water at the highest temperature that they can tolerate without harming themselves, G-d forbid. (If taking hot water from a pesachdik source, be sure to use a disposable cup for this process).
Friday night: Young  people with braces, or those with bridgework should be careful to eat only the soft sections of bread and make sure the crumbs do not get stuck between the gaps in their dental work. In these cases, softening the bread in liquid may help. Once finished with chametz, those with any dental work (including dentures and fillings) should make sure their teeth are perfectly clean before eating anything hot or sharp (this refers to pesachdik food—for kashering purposes, no hot chametz may be eaten at this point).
Shabbos morning: After completing our meal, we must rinse our mouths well from any leftover crumbs. Toothpicks or flossers (or precut floss) may be used for to reach any holes or gaps, if doing so gently will not draw blood. Agitate your finger over your teeth to loosen any stuck particles. Rinse with mouthwash to render any remaining chametz inedible.
*You may not use toothpaste, but a dry toothbrush that is made for use on Shabbos is okay, if you are not prone to drawing blood when brushing.
*All this must be done before the end-time for eating chametz. The toothbrush may be rinsed after use to remove chametz crumbs and then it should be put away in the designated cabinet sold to a non-Jew.
*Denture wearers (who kashered their teeth yesterday, as mentioned), should rinse them well before the end-time for owning chametz. Hot water boiled before Shabbos for this purpose may be used to assist the cleaning.

" May a Sefardi use Chabad/Ashkenazi Tefillin?
As a Shliach who deals primarily with sefardim, I often hear that sefardim can strictly only use sefardic tefillin. I’ve also heard once that Chabad or Arizal is ok for them. Is there any basis for this? Just this Shabbos when talking to someone about putting on Tefillin the discussion came up again so I need clarity to be able to advise properly.","
According to the major Sefardi Poskim of our generation (Horav Ovadya and Horav B”tz Abba Shaul), a Sefardi can use and make a Brocha on Chabad tefillin (no matter which Ksav).
Here are [some of] the details:
There are two issues for a Sefardi using Ashkenazi tefillin:
1. The Ksav is different. In this matter it accepted by the Poskim (including Horav Ovadya in Yabia Omer Vol. II Y”D siman 20 and Horav B”tz Abba Shaul in shu”t Ohr Letziyon Vol. II ch 3 ois 7) that Halachically both forms of writing are acceptable for both traditions. This is also offered as the explanation for why the Beis Yossef describes the Ashkenazi Ksav and not the Sefardi Ksav. {The Chida’s opinion is unclear, as there are several contradictions in his various sefarim, but the above is the accepted Sefardi Psak}
2. There is a separate issue regarding the spacing between the parshiyos. Most Ashkenazi Tefillin use the spacing of the Ta”z, whereas contemporary Sefardi Poskim are of the opinion that this is not kosher according to the Beis Yosef and they use the Rambam’s spacing. For the above reason contemporary Sefardi Poskim say that a Sefardi should not make a Brocha on Ashkenazi Tefillin.
However, the Alter Rebbe also disagrees with the Ta”z’s spacing and Paskens that one must use the Rambam’s spacing. For this reason Chabad tefillin (regardless of whether written in Ksav Ar”i or Alter Rebbe’s Ksav) follow the same spacing as Sefard, thus avoiding this second problem as well. As a matter-of-fact Rb”tz Abba Shaul specifically states in the above noted Ohr Letziyon that a Sefardi should not say a Brocha on Askenazi tefillin unless it is Chabad tefillin.
P.S. As an aside, the Alter Rebbe’s ksav is perhaps the only remaining Ashkenazi Ksav which writes the letter Nun the same way as the Sefardim.","###question

This is also offered as the explanation for why the Beis Yossef describes the Ashkenazi Ksav and not the Sefardi Ksav. {The Chida’s opinion is unclear, as there are several contradictions in his various sefarim, but the above is the accepted Sefardi Psak}
2. There is a separate issue regarding the spacing between the parshiyos. Most Ashkenazi Tefillin use the spacing of the Ta”z, whereas contemporary Sefardi Poskim are of the opinion that this is not kosher according to the Beis Yosef and they use the Rambam’s spacing. For the above reason contemporary Sefardi Poskim say that a Sefardi should not make a Brocha on Ashkenazi Tefillin.
However, the Alter Rebbe also disagrees with the Ta”z’s spacing and Paskens that one must use the Rambam’s spacing. For this reason Chabad tefillin (regardless of whether written in Ksav Ar”i or Alter Rebbe’s Ksav) follow the same spacing as Sefard, thus avoiding this second problem as well. As a matter-of-fact Rb”tz Abba Shaul specifically states in the above noted Ohr Letziyon that a Sefardi should not say a Brocha on Askenazi tefillin unless it is Chabad tefillin.
P.S. As an aside, the Alter Rebbe’s ksav is perhaps the only remaining Ashkenazi Ksav which writes the letter Nun the same way as the Sefardim."

 How should Kohanim hold their hands during Birchas Kohanim?,"There are many customs with regards to the particular way a Kohen should spread his fingers during N’sias Kapayim, but first, it is important to outline what is Halachically required1:
The Hands are spread only after the Brocho – L’voreich Es Amoi Yisroel B’ahava2 which is said only after turning around to the Tzibur3.
The Hands must be raised to at least Shoulder Height4. If difficult to hold the hands up continuously, they may be lowered only in between the words5. According to many, it’s appropriate to raise the hands slightly higher, up to eye level. This is indeed the common practice. Some also note that the Kohen should attempt to raise not just his hands, but also his arms should be fully raised and extended forward (elbows straightened)6.
The hands/Fingers should be flexed open completely7 with the palms of the hand facing (mostly) downwards8.
When aligning the hands, the right hand should be slightly higher than the left hand9.
Position of the Fingers
The Halachic outline: There is no specification made in this regard until the later Rishonim and thus there isn’t any particular position that is Halachically necessary10.
Nonetheless, the Kohanim customarily separate their fingertips as alluded to in the interpretation by the Midrash of the verse, “peering through the windows” — that the Divine Presence rests above their heads and gazes through the spaces between their fingers.
The fingers are positioned in a manner which leaves five “windows”. This is done by separating each hand into three “sections”—leaving spaces on each hand between the thumb and index finger, and between the middle and ring finger. The fifth space is completed by the way the two thumbs are configured together.
In general, there are two ways to making the fifth space 1) by holding the thumbs apart from each other leaving a gap, 2) by holding the thumbs together but in a “window-like configuration”.  the Alter Rebbe brings both Minhogim11.
Each of the common Minhogim is valid and contains unique meaning12 and should be adhered to if you have a clear family tradition one way or another. (Nonetheless, there are benefits in learning what is the most commonly accepted Minhag in Chabad, as recommended in the letter of the Rebbe in Igros Kodesh referenced above. The Rebbe recommends checking to see if R’ Chaim Noeh wrote anything. See below)

After extensive attempts to find out the particular traditions in the families of generational Kohanim in Anash, it seems fair to conclude that even among longstanding Anash families there are several traditions.
Note: it’s worth pointing out a practical and probable reason for why there isn’t a more uniform Minhag in this regard: According to our Minhag the Kohanim cover their hands with the Tallis, thus nobody other than the kohen’s own (very) young children would ever be seeing how he holds his hands. Additionally, the Zohar warns against looking at the hands of the Kohanim during the Brocho.
It has been written in some places that the common minhag in Chabad is to hold the thumbs apart as per the first opinion in the Alter Rebbe’s Shulchan Aruch, this is also the only way written by R’ Chaim Noeh13.
However our research has indicated that while some Anash families (1) have this tradition, the majority of families do connect the two thumbs in one form or another (as per the second opinion).
The most common form we’ve found among Anash (2) is to connect the two thumbs at their knuckles, thus leaving a fifth window between the tips of their thumbs, as the tips of the thumbs are bent away from each other (see attached image).
The second most common (3) is having the very tips of the thumbs connected to each other, followed by having the thumbs apart (as above), followed further by other less common forms of connecting the thumbs.

"How is challah separated?
Do I separate from each type or 1 separation is good as long as it’s min hamukaf? Does min hamukaf mean if it’s the same room or it needs to be in 1 tray/basket?","
In order to separate challa with a bracha: You need to make sure that you have the right amount of flour, and that the flour is at least half of the other ingredients. If the flour is less than 1/6, there is no need to separate challah altogether. Since cake is usually made with juice, you should add a drop of water into the batter. It should be noted that many have the custom not to make a bracha on noticeably sweeet cakes altogether and this is preferable.
Since it is a liquid batter, the challa should be separated only after baking and not beforehand.
Now, because the cakes are different types, you need to separate from each type by itself, assuming each batter has a full shiur Challah. This is achieved by placing all cakes from 1 type (e.g. all chocolate cakes) into one container or covered by a cloth, having them touch each other, and then Chala should be separated. This should be done for each different type of cake, although only 1 bracha is needed if all of it is being done consecutively.
[If one is baking different types of Challa this should be accomplished either by 1) sticking together the two doughs, enough that if you would pull them apart a bit off the other dough will come off with the other dough. or 2) by placing the two doughs in the same vessel (that has a border- wall that surrounds them].","###question

Indeed this is a problem. This applies Friday night and during the week as well.

" What is the minimum size Tzitzis for children under Bar Mitzvah?
Regarding after Bar Mitzvah:
Can the garment of the 2 shoulders on the sides of the hole count towards the front/back Amos?
I vaguely recall Reb Chaim Naeh writing that if the shoulder parts are a certain width, then they can count towards the length of the front/back.","
Under Bar Mitzvah:
The Alter Rebbe rules in the Siddur that the age of Chinuch begins at six. Nevertheless, Minhag Chabad is to begin at the age of three, based on directives of the Frierdiker Rebbe and the Rebbe.
See here regarding a child under the age of 3:
Is it encouraged or discouraged for a child under 3, and not toilet trained to put on Tzitzis?
According to many Poskim, the Mitzvah of Chinuch does not just mean that the child thinks that he is doing the Mitzvah, but he has to actually be doing it for real. Therefore, the child has to be given Tzitzis which are Kosher. [If this is difficult, (e.g. it is very normal for young children to constantly rip their Tzitzis,) perhaps there is room to rely on the lenient opinions (as discussed below) between the ages of three and six, given that Chinuch does not Halachically begin until the age of six anyway.]
When a child is six years of age and older, the tallis katan should be an amah wide and an amah long. The measurement of the amah may include the front and back together but not the hole. For Children – If each shoulder section is at least 3 etzbaos wide (total of 6 etzbaos), one may include the hole too. Another leniency for children is, that one may rely on the lenient measurement of amah, which is 46cm. For the three etzbaos, one may follow the measurement of 5.76cm.
Once a child reaches Bar Mitzvah:
There needs to be an amah width, an amah length in front, and another amah length in back. One should ensure it’s at least 48cm. Best to add extra as often the tallis katan folds and the folds are not included in the shiur.
I haven’t found a reasonable explanation why people are not careful in this matter for children, at least from six and up. Some suggest a leniency that the amah width may also be comprised of both front and back together. This is unlikely.
The commercially available tzitzis are also not produced this way, making it difficult for children. The ones that are of a minimum shiur in the width are much longer than needed and the hole is usually too large causing it to fall and not sit properly. Of course, these can be made at home or one can shorten the size of the commercially available taleisim ktanim by sewing up the extra material.
An alternative option is to put on size 20 tzitzis on the child to make the Brocho and the rest of the day to wear kids size. The child should wear it for at least three seconds.
Counting the hole:
The Alter Rebbe writes in the Siddur that the hole of the neck does not count for the required size. Based on this – the “shoulders” can not count, because the hole separates them (by children we can be lenient if the shoulder is 3 etzbaos as explained earlier).","###question

P.S. In my opinion, you shouldn’t change to oil, as our minhag is to use candles. According to many opinions, candles are preferred over oil."

" Can a Kohen go to the Ohel?
I read the following on Wikipedia, is it true?
The Chabad Ohel . . presents a problem to a visiting kohen.
Usual visitors access the Ohel via a walkway that is fenced off from the other graves in the cemetery, creating a separate enclosure in which visitors pass but lacking the minimal four tefach requirement on either side of pathway.
Thus, even though the Ohel itself is open to the sky to eliminate problems of tum’at met in an enclosure the kohen is unable to gain entry to the actual ohel without coming within four tefachim of the tombstones located on both sides of walkway.
As halacha mandates a Kohen keep a distance of 12.59 inches (320 mm) (four tefachim) away from a tombstone (provided it is fenced in, and 75.59 inches (1,920 mm) inches if the tombstone is not fenced it).","
According to many Poskim, if there is a fence there is no issue even if the Kohanim stand within four Tefochim. Nevertheless, if one wants to be stringent he can walk through the large road, not through the pathway coming from the tent, and when reaching the pathway he can walk in the middle the pathway where I believe he won’t be within four Tefochim (which is just about 13 inches) of the Kevorim on either side.","###question

Preferably, one should remove the Shabbos tablecloth after Havdalah and then place a new one for Melave Malka. This new one should be respectable. It’s questionable whether one should ideally avoid using a tablecloth that is ordinarily used for weekday meals.

" Can I ask a non-Jew to turn on my oven on Yom Tov?

I can tape the button that pops out when you open the door to alleviate the issues that poses.","
Indeed, lighting a fire on Yom Tov (but not on Shabbos, of course) and Amirah Lenachri are both considered Shvus.
The Halacha is that “Shvus DShvus” is only permissible if it is for the sake of a Mitzvah, to avoid sickness, to avert a big financial loss, or for another similarly urgent and pressing need. Additionally, this applies only to one who already finds himself in such a situation. One should not plan to rely on this principle in advance, but rather, should make any necessary arrangements to ensure this does not eventuate.
Generally speaking, an activity which is extremely needed for Simchas Yom Tov falls in the category of “sake of a Mitzvah”.
Not having an oven available on Yom Tov may pose a serious concern of lack of Simchas Yom Tov. This is especially true regarding the Fleishig oven, which one uses for the main Seudos of the day. In regards to the Milchig oven, it isn’t something sufficient to permit the work of a Goy. One option would be to double-wrap the Milchig food and use it in the Fleishig oven.

" Is it inappropriate to go skydiving with a male instructor?
Is it inappropriate to go skydiving with a male instructor? It’s all done very professionally. It’s the same idea as a doctor. I’m just wondering because it’s a very close touch. There are no woman instructors.","
Incorrect.
With a doctor, since it’s for medical purposes, it’s permitted. This does not apply to sport. Even when using doctors if female doctors are available.
P.S.: One should avoid doing dangerous sports such as skydiving and the like (regardless of the above-mentioned).
Reasonings:
A Jew should not endanger his life. This is a Biblical conjunction as it says, (Devarim 4:15), “You shall be very careful to protect your souls”. See also Rambam (Hilchos Rotzeiach U’shmiras Hanefesh 12:6).
However, we find that the Torah allows one to take some risk in order to make a livelihood as it says, (Devarim 24:15) “and to him, he shall carry his life”.
The Noda Be’Yehuda (Tanina Yoreh Deah 10) writes that for this reason a sailor or caravan merchant may endanger their lives to make their livelihood. However, one may not do activities which are dangerous if they are not for livelihood purposes. For this reason, one may not do sport hunting (without addressing the issue of causing pain and waste to animals) since it endangers one’s life.
See also Shem Aryeh (responsa 27).
It is also mentioned in the Talmud (Shabbos 32a) that Rabbi Yannai said: A person should never stand in a place of danger saying that they will perform a miracle for him, lest they do not perform a miracle for him. And, if they do perform a miracle for him, they will deduct it from his merits.","###question 
  Is it inappropriate to go skydiving with a male instructor?
Is it inappropriate to go skydiving with a male instructor? It’s all done very professionally. It’s the same idea as a doctor. I’m just wondering because it’s a very close touch. There are no woman instructors..
 ###answer 
 
Incorrect.
With a doctor, since it’s for medical purposes, it’s permitted. This does not apply to sport. Even when using doctors if female doctors are available.
P.S.: One should avoid doing dangerous sports such as skydiving and the like (regardless of the above-mentioned).

 Is a Kallah allowed to wear a see-through veil on her wedding day?,"It should be thick enough that she should not be able to see through it, nor should others be able to see her.
Explanation: 
There are a number of reasons why a Kallah wears a veil:
The two reasons implied in Shulchan Oruch (Even Hoezer 31:2) are:
For the sake of Tznius.
To indicate that the Kallah consents to the marriage irrespective of the true value of the ring, to the point that she doesn’t even need to see it.
It is self-evident that these two aspects are achieved only with a veil that is opaque and not transparent.","###question

" Can a Man Daven in the Women’s Section?
Aside from the uncomfortable feelings of showing up at shul and seeing men on the women’s side… Is it even halachically allowed for men to Daven on the women’s side when no women are yet present, and what about when they do show up, does halacha require them to move?","
A man is Halachically allowed to Daven in the women’s section as long as no women are present. If he knows that women are arriving soon, he should leave beforehand, and certainly once a woman arrives he must leave immediately. The exact arrangements should be worked out with the Rav and Gabai of the Shul.
Whether the man may be counted as part of the Minyan is a matter of dispute and depends largely on the setup of the Mechitza. Additionally, according to some opinions, the Women’s section is of lesser holiness than the rest of the Shul, although it would seem that this too depends if it’s the same room or not.

" Is it halachically forbidden to give away parts of Eretz Yisroel to the Arabs?
I don’t doubt the Rebbe’s words for a second, I am only asking so I can understand and explain to others:
We can’t give away parts of Eretz Yisroel because this is something that Hashem gave to us, the Jewish people. This is in short, I think, the Rebbe’s view on the topic. If so, how is this a reason for not giving away land? If someone gives me something, it is mine completely and I can do with it as I wish. If we were given Ba’alus over Eretz Yisroel, why can’t we give parts of or the whole land away? And if we don’t have such ability to do so, then what kind of gift is this?","
Here are a few points to consider:
Eretz Yisroel was given to every single Jew, thus no government can decide to give it away.
Giving away parts of Eretz Yisroel affects the safety of those living there. This has been corroborated by military experts and is evident by the rockets being fired now, which would not reach so far if those areas were still populated by Jews. The Rebbe often quoted Shulchan Aruch 329, from where we can see the importance of cities near the border.
Giving away parts of Eretz Yisroel displays a sign of weakness. It’s not a struggle about the land per se, rather it’s about our very existence. Any withdrawal from land is a withdrawal on our rights to exist as the Jewish People.","###question

 What is the concept of having something warm on Motzei Shabbos?,"
There are two separate ideas, both derived from the Gemara in Mesechta Shabbos 119b.
One is to cook something new for Melava Malka (-since it is freshly cooked it is usually warm but that is not the point-) and the other is to drink hot water on Motzei Shabbos.
Cooking something new for Melava Malka is a Halacha, but it is not a full obligation, rather it is the preferred manner of making Melava Malka. If this is difficult, one can instead eat fruits for Melava Malka. (this meal is also a segula for the luz bone etc.)
Drinking hot water on Motzei Shabbos is not an obligation but rather has a special healing effect.
The common Chabad custom (-not unique to Chabad-) is to make Hamotzie and cook something new (not necessarily fleishig) for Melava Malka and drink hot water/tea.

You should go back to the beginning after the opening words “Baruch Ato etc. Melech Haloam” and mention both categories of food.

It is necessary to leave the bread on the table where one ate. Leaving bread in the same room is not enough. However, one may clear the table of big pieces of bread and just keep some crumbs, as long as they are big enough that it will be considered normal to eat (i. e. it shouldn’t be so small that it will be considered like dust).
You may also put the pieces of bread in a bag and tie it so that the kids shouldn’t play with it.
If none of this is possible, and since there is concern that the bread will be destroyed or defaced, you don’t have to leave bread on the table.","###question

" Is Mindfulness Meditation Kosher?

It really depends on what you mean when you’re saying mindfulness. The concept of mindfulness is rooted in Torah. However, the implementation of the principles and discipline of mindfulness can vary so much, depending on who, what and how.
Please tell us what specifically you have in mind.
Question clarified:
It’s hard to describe but basically what you do is you just sit on the couch and you just try as much as possible with your eyes closed to feel present and to let yourself only focus on the different things that you are currently feeling, like feeling yourself seeping into the couch, feeling your arms relaxed, feeling the breathing that you’re doing. In general, just feeling what you’re feeling and letting all thoughts, worries that come into your head, letting them fly by, and just noticing them as if you’re just a spectator. I hope I’m explaining it OK. But I just know that different professionals claimed that they got this from buddha kind of thing I wasn’t sure if this is halachically ok.
Answer:
Though the very description described does not seem to be an issue, still, this approach to meditation does not align very well with the Torah approach. Meditations that appear in Jewish literature concentrate on focusing your mind on a specific topic which can arouse you to a higher level of serving Hashem. Judaism is mind-oriented, where proper thoughts influence emotions. This is in stark contrast to this approach where one is encouraged to keep their mind clear and unoccupied.
From a Torah perspective, an empty mind is a black hole, or in the worst-case scenario, it could become a vacuum to draw in destructive thoughts. To quote Hayom Yom, 16 Cheshvan:
Thought is a garment and servant of the intellect and emotions. Even when it is not serving the intellect or emotions, it continues to function, thinking and meditating. However, this activity is then not only devoid of content, but also open to depravement… It is explained that alien or evil thoughts are caused by “emptiness of the head.” For when the mind is occupied, the thought has something to serve, and there is no room for stupid and vain thoughts devoid of substance.
An additional, but fundamental, point to consider: while the actual behavior described below is not against halacha, Mindfulness as a movement and taught by instructors who are sourcing it from buddhism, would make it problematic, see here:
There is a women’s group who do yoga. It is an exercise/workout class with an instructor, and may not be Jewish. A friend mentioned that yoga may be an issue regarding Avodah Zara. Is there a problem to attend?  
I suggest you source your information on mindfulness or meditation from Jewish sources. For example, a good way to start (in English): Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan’s books “Jewish Meditation“, “Meditation and the Bible“.

“When a petitioner or applicant for naturalization, by reason of religious training and belief (or individual interpretation thereof), or for other reasons of good conscience, cannot take the oath prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section with the words “on oath” … the words “and solemnly affirm” shall be substituted for the words “on oath” … and the oath shall be taken in such modified form. Any reference to ‘oath of allegiance’ in this chapter is understood to mean equally ‘affirmation of allegiance’ as described in this paragraph.”
See here.
You certainly shouldn’t lift up the xtian bible. I don’t think it is a requirement.

In theory, yes, as long as it’s still possible to put the letters together in such a way that they are legible. In other words, if it has been totally destroyed it is not permissible.
Nonetheless, in practice, one should attempt not to break in the area where there are letters. Moreover, in the first instance one should ensure to open it before Shabbos.

It depends:

A- Ownership of the store/factory:
If the store/factory is Jewishly owned and the workers are Jewish, its products do not require Tevilah. If the workers are non-Jewish, its products require Tevilah but without reciting a Brocha.

" Should I do a Bedikah while waiting to hear back from the Rov regarding my Moch Dachuk?
I gave birth approx 6 weeks ago and trying to get tehora.
I made a hefsek and a moch on Monday and there was some color on it so I sent in the shaila to the rov and got an answer after shkia the next day, on Tuesday.
My questions are as follows:
On Tuesday before shkia, am I supposed to just make a bedika as if the hefsek and moch were good or should I assume that they weren’t good and do a hefsek and moch again?
In general, from when blood slows down to almost no blood but there is still some shailos – should I keep doing hefseks every day till the rov says it’s good?
When sending in a shaila of hefsek/moch and waiting for the rov’s answer, should I conduct myself as if it was shivah neki’im – wearing white and doing bedikos – or should I wait for the rov’s answer?","
The answer to all three questions is to continue performing the bedikos regularly, and if the shailah is no good, then the next bedika that was performed counts as the hefsek.
Of course, in a case where making a moch dachuk presents no complications and concerns, one should do so.","###question

Yes, if needed one may hint to a Goy to turn on a light on Shabbos provided that:
There already is some light in the room and he is only adding in light.
You say to him something from which he understands that you want him to turn on the light, however, it is forbidden to tell him to do anything, even if you aren’t directly telling him to turn on the light. For example, you may say to him “it’s dark in here”, however you may not say “please help me see my plate” or the like.

" When out on the road & using a prayer direction app, which opinion does Chabad use to determine the direction of Yerushalayim?
See the attachment for the shitos that are presented as options","
Accepted Chabad practice appears to follow the Rhumb Line bearing.
Explanation: 
This matter is a Machlokes Achronim. In Shulchan Oruch (Orach Chaim 94:2), the Alter Rebbe describes the exact calculations to make, and these appear to conform to the Great Circle Bearing (see Simas Ayin page 5 onward, Kovetz Yagdil Torah volume 6 page 52 onwards). In the Siddur (D”H Bitfilas), the Alter Rebbe gives approximate bearings towards Yerushalayim for Northern European cities (150° SE), and although they don’t exactly conform to either bearing (see Simas Ayin for a proposed explanation for this discrepancy), it is closer to the Great Circle Bearing than the Rhumb Line bearing (if we assume the Alter Rebbe is focused on Poland/Lithuania/Belarus).
Despite this, 770 follows a Rhumb Line bearing (as observed in Kovetz Yagdil Torah) and this seems to be the widespread practice among Chabad. (To use some extreme examples, both Honolulu and Anchorage need to face West using the Rhumb Line bearing, but would need to face North using the Great Circle bearing.) It may also be observed that the Alter Rebbe’s calculations were for Northern European cities, where there is generally not much of a discrepancy between these two types of bearings.
Either way, the Alter Rebbe in his Siddur was satisfied with providing very rough approximations (150° SE for all of Northern Europe) and did not mandate any further precision. This would imply that one does not have to face Yerushalayim at an extremely precise angle, but just its general direction.","###question

" I bought a pre seasoned frying pan from Amazon, does it need to be Kashered?","Unless it has a reliable Hechsher, the skillet must be kashered before use.
The proper way to kasher new cast iron cookware is through hag’alah, which involves bringing a pot of water to a boil and then submerging the cookware into the water. [If one mistakenly uses cast iron cookware with a non-kosher item, in many cases libun gamur will be required].
Hag’alah for cast iron cookware is complicated by two matters – the size of the cookware and its weight/thickness – as follows. Some cast iron cookware is so large that it cannot easily be put into a pot of boiling water. In such cases it is worth remembering that hag’alas keilim is different than tevillas keilim in that one may kasher the utensil piecemeal and there is no need to submerge the entire pot in the hag’alah water at once. The other issue is that due to the weight and thickness of cast iron cookware, the metal will not get hot if one merely dips into the hag’alah water for a few seconds. Rather, the items should be put into the boiling water and left there for long enough that the water itself comes back to a boil, which indicates that the cast iron itself has become heated to hag’alah temperatures.

" Can Bechor (firstborn son) who was born through C section serve in the Beis HaMikdash?
Hi, All my life I grew up thinking I was a Bechor of my family, but recently I found out I’m not. As I studied halacha a lot more I found out that Bechorim who weren’t born naturally are not technically Bechorim. This destroyed me. I’m a huge learner with regards to the Mikdash and it was always my dream to serve in it. After learning from the sages that Bechorim will serve in the third Mikdash with Kohanim and Levi’im I was very excited. Then I heard that a Bechor that was born through the means of C section doesn’t get the same privilege as a Bechor born through traditional birth. I decided to find a way to halachically and historically prove that Bechorim born through C section birth also serve in the Mikdash. I wanted to ask the Rabbi’s opinion on this. Is it possible to come up with halachic proof of this when a lot of the commentators go against it? What do you have to say about this? Am I a Bechor in terms of future serving in the Mikdash or not? Thanks for your time and have a great Shabbos and easy fast.","
Someone born through C Section is not considered a Bechor in regards to most things, unless most of his body, or most of his front part of the skull (above the forehead), came out before the operation.
P.S.
1. Regarding the work of Bechorim in the Beis Hamikdash -when Moshiach comes- it’s not clear when exactly, and in which period, this will occur, but definitely not in the first period of the days of Moshiach. See also here:
Bechorim Serving in the Third Beis Hamikdosh
2. You’re pain is understandable, as this is something you always anticipated, and now your hopes are dashed. If you discover that for whatever reason you will not be able to serve in the Mikdash you may find solace in the fact that this proves that this is not your mission in this world, and maybe your mission is something even higher. We have many great leaders, such as Moshe Rabeinu, or Dovid Hamelech, who also cannot work in the Beis Hamikdash, as they are neither Kohanim or Bechorim.
Instead of wallowing in pain, and trying to investigate theoretical concepts that have no solid basis, you should channel this pain, and let it bring you to new heights, by intensifying your efforts for what IS your mission.
3. In regards to your actual point, there is a possibility, that when Moshiach comes, we will find out the Halacha is, like the opinion, that for work in Beis Hamikdash one only needs to be a Bechor to his father, and not his mother, which possibly includes one born through C Section.
To explain: if work in the Mikdash requires one to be a bechor to his mother, then obviously someone who has been born through a C-section isn’t included. If however, the ruling will be that a firstborn to the father qualifies for work, this might include someone born from a C-section too.
There are two reasons this may be so:
1. Maybe the Halacha then will be established according to opinion that someone born through C section will be considered a firstborn regarding inheritance and accordingly for work in the Mikdash.
2. It’s also possible that regarding work in Beis Hamikdash the halacha is different than inheritance and someone born through a C-section might be included.","###question

" Does it matter which edition I use to learn the daily Rambam?
I know that when it comes to the hakdama (introduction) of the Rambam we don’t use the Rambam Le’am edition for the daily shiur.
My question is about the Seder Hatefillah, I know there are different versions in the various editions, which one is the best one to use? Because some are much shorter than the other. And do we know the Rebbe’s personal custom?","
The reason many don’t use the Rambam Le’am for the first few shiurim of the cycle, is because it combines the counting of mitzvos (with  their sources in the Torah) with the order of Halachos, even though they were written separately and are supposed to be learned on separate days. (First all the positive mitzvos with their p’sukim, followed by all negative mitzvos with their p’sukim, and then all mitzvos (positive and negative) as they are set up in the order of the Rambam, without the p’sukim).
Regarding the Seder Hatefillah: Generally, Kisvei Yad Teiman are known to be most accurate. The Kapach, Shilat (Rambam Meduyak), Makbili (Mifal Mishnah Torah), and Even Yisroel (Steinsaltz, Mishnah Torah Hamevuar) follow these manuscripts, with slight variation from one to another.
Nonetheless, the reality is that the printed versions are the ones which were accepted throughout Klal Yisroel and were studied by Gedolei Yisroel over the generations.
I don’t think it’s possible to know with certainty the Rebbe’s personal custom. The Rebbe was seen in public many times with the Rambam Le’am (and sometimes with a regular Rambam).
In sichos, the Rebbe discusses both the printed version as well as the Yemenite manuscripts. Often, the Rebbe gives preference for one over the other, depending on the context.
Incidentally, when it comes to Seder Hatefillah, the Rebbe points out that in the manuscript of Sefer Ahavah (knows as Sefer Hachasum, which is the basis for the Rambam Meduyak) which was edited by the Rambam, the book concludes with Hilchos Milah, and Seder Hatefillah is an addendum after the conclusion of the Sefer.","###question

"Is saying a “lechayim” considered “kalus rosh” while wearing Tefillin, or it is allowed?","Is eating a piece of mezonos allowed lechatchila or it is a midas Chassidus to wait until after Tefillin is taken off?
Is it – forbidden/allowed/better not – to have a small conversation while wearing tefillin?
In all above is there any difference between Rashi and Rabbeinu Tam tefillin?
Answers:
Strictly speaking, it is permitted to have a snack and drink while wearing Tefillin and there is no need to remove them. This includes mezonos up to a kebeitza and all non Mezonos foods (any amount). Alcoholic beverages may be drunk if less than the size of kebeitzah.
Although some Chassidim were lenient and snacked in Tefillin, many Poskim write that in today’s day and age when we wear our Tefillin only for Davening (and especially according to our Minhag that we delay putting on Tefillin until Eizehu Mekomon in order to minimize the time of wearing Tefillin), it is correct to remove the Tefillin before taking a bite. This is especially true regarding saying Lechaim, even a small amount, which can commonly lead to lightheadedness.
One may speak in Tefillin as long as they do not divert their mind from the Tefillin. However, it is brought down in Kitzur Shulchan Aruch that one who is careful with the mitzvah of tefillin, and treats them with Kedusha, not to speak inconsequential words or non-sacred discussions while wearing them, will merit to have long life and is promised to be a member in the world to come.

Yes, if you normally charge $1500. You may not pay yourself from Ma’aser money for a service which otherwise you would not charge for.
Additionally, even if you usually charge, Maaser must be separated and given.

Certainly, one may not calculate discounts which were already given in the past as Maaser, if they haven’t intended so when they gave the discount.
Lastly, I would like to point out that you would have to separate Ma’aser from your total income. In this case, this would be the entire fee, including what you would pay yourself from your ma’aser money (i.e., in your example, you should give $150 as Maaser and not just $50).","###question

 What is the correct way to take the three steps at the end of Shmone Esrei?,"Question 1: Regarding the three steps after Shmoneh Esrei, are they meant to be three steps, as the finishing step which makes the feet next to each other, or is it three and a fourth step to make the feet equal?
Answer 1: The common custom – and this was the Rebbe’s practice too – is to take three steps after Shemone Esrai as follows: the first step is with the left foot placed behind the right foot, then a large step with the right foot behind the left foot and then another large step with the left foot behind the right foot. After these three steps, the right foot is adjusted to be parallel to the left foot.
This applies only after Shemone Esrei.
Question 2: Regarding the steps before Shmoneh Esrei – the third step has to be the one to make one foot parallel the other? or I am able to take another step?
Answer 2: You may take another step but it’s not required. There is no need to make the feet parallel to each other when moving back before Shemone Esrei.

 Are siblings (brothers and sisters) allowed to dance together at a wedding?,"The Halacha is that a brother may not hug or kiss a sister or vice versa. This applies to any type of affectionate physical contact between them.
Dancing together is considered affectionate physical contact. So many poskim have decried the practice of mixed dancing due to the physical contact between the genders. It follows that brother and sister too may not have such type of physical contact. Indeed, this is spelled out clearly in a number of contemporary sources indicated below.
See also the attached from “A guide to Chabad Weddings“, recently published by Mikvah.org and approved by multiple Rabbonei Anash.
This is also why husband and wife are not to be dancing with each other in the presence of others, since dancing together is considered affectionate behavior and they are not to show their affection for each other in the presence of other people.
Furthermore, even the holy practice of mitzvah tantz was abolished in Chabad, as the Rebbe wrote, because we have seen in practice what has happened as a result of this in so many weddings. Certainly, a dance among family, not in the context of the mitzvah tantz should not be done. How much more so when this is done in the presence of other people, which creates immoral thoughts.

P.S. Another equally important issue is the fact that all too often mistakes happen and unfortunately many Jewish people mistakenly consume non-kosher food at such gatherings.

 Can a teacher take things away from children and not give it back?,"This depends on a lot of details.
If it is something dangerous, either physically or spiritually for the student, not only may the Mechanech take it away, he must confiscate it. It should not be given back to the child and depending on what it is and the age of the student, it might need to be returned to the parents.
Similarly, if a student brings something which they are not allowed to according to the school rules, it may be confiscated.
Poskim disagree whether a teacher may confiscate an object which is disturbing the learning in class such as food or an otherwise permitted toy, or not. Even those who are stringent allow the teacher to hold the object in the front of the room until the class or day is over.
Regarding returning the object, the object usually belongs to the parents of the child. Thus, the teacher may not keep it and must return it.
Even so, the school has the right to make continued attendance at the school conditional on the parent/ student not owning the said object, so that the parents can choose if they prefer the ownership of the item or continued attendance.
When dealing with bochurim: if a Bochur goes against the rules and caused an object to be taken away, he essentially gave up ownership of the object if that is the rule in Yeshiva. Since school rules allow for teachers to confiscate students’ objects when disturbing the learning, it is assumed that any student who attends the school does so with this understanding. Accordingly, the student has effectively relinquished his rights to these objects.

There are a few points to have in mind when turning a pergola into a Sukkah:
1) Material of the support for the S’chach:
From the picture it looks like it will be wooden beams – that is totally fine and the S’chach may lie directly on them. Otherwise, if it’s something which is not Kosher for S’chach, such as made of a material which is susceptible to Tum׳ah (e.g., metal), the S’chach should (lechatchila) be supported by wooden slats or the like.
2) Width of the beams vs. the space between them:
The width of the space between beams (where the S’chach will be visible from inside the Sukkah) must be at least as wide as the beams themselves. Again, from the picture it appears that this is not an issue at all.
3) Space between the beams:
There is a Chumra that the crossbeams should be at least 3 Tefachim (24cm) apart from each other. But this is not the halacha. See details here:

The check should be written to the older Chabad house whom you got the pushka from.

You shouldn’t use the pushka for donations to a different cause, as the pushka technically still belongs to the institution which gave it to you.

" Bor Al Gabei Bor Mikveh: Hiddur or Minhag? 
Is the Chabad custom of women going to a bor al gabei bor mikveh a hiddur or a minhag or something else? Where I live right now, the mikveh is called bor geshomim.
I would prefer bor al gabei bor since that is what I learned in kallah classes. what should I do in the case where mikveh would be on Shabbos or Yom Tov? There are possibly other mikvaos around but I’m not sure if they are within safe walking distance or if those are not al gabei bor either.","
Chabad Chassidim are very particular about using a bor al gabei bor mikveh wherever possible as it touches upon the very kashrus of the Mikvah. Please see more about this here.
You write that your local Mikvah is called a “bor geshomim”. Please note that “bor geshomim” means that the Mikvah is a rainwater one. It does not necessarily define the type of boros, if it’s side by side or bor al gabei bor. It could very well be that in your case the actual pool for immersion is itself comprised of pure rainwater (in addition to the rainwater bor which connects to the immersion pool). If this is the case, then this would be much better than a standard bor al gabei bor mikvah.
As explained in the link above, it is a well-accepted rule that one should strive to go to a Mikveh which is more Mehudar, bor al gabei bor, or one where the actual pool for immersion is itself comprised of pure rainwater, whenever possible practically. Otherwise, other mikvaos qualify too, even if they are bor btzad bor (side by side).
It goes without saying that this only applies where there is proper hashgachah of a reliable rov. If a mikvah has no such supervision, one shouldn’t use it regardless if it is bor al gabei bor or not. And certainly, a bor btzad bor (side by side) mikvah with supervision trumps any type of mikvah which is without supervision.","###question 
  Bor Al Gabei Bor Mikveh: Hiddur or Minhag? 
Is the Chabad custom of women going to a bor al gabei bor mikveh a hiddur or a minhag or something else? Where I live right now, the mikveh is called bor geshomim.
I would prefer bor al gabei bor since that is what I learned in kallah classes. what should I do in the case where mikveh would be on Shabbos or Yom Tov? There are possibly other mikvaos around but I’m not sure if they are within safe walking distance or if those are not al gabei bor either..
 ###answer 
 
Chabad Chassidim are very particular about using a bor al gabei bor mikveh wherever possible as it touches upon the very kashrus of the Mikvah. Please see more about this here.
You write that your local Mikvah is called a “bor geshomim”. Please note that “bor geshomim” means that the Mikvah is a rainwater one. It does not necessarily define the type of boros, if it’s side by side or bor al gabei bor. It could very well be that in your case the actual pool for immersion is itself comprised of pure rainwater (in addition to the rainwater bor which connects to the immersion pool). If this is the case, then this would be much better than a standard bor al gabei bor mikvah.

"Move the pieces of the timer to make it turn off sooner?
Move the pieces while the appliance is off to cause it to turn on sooner?","
When an appliance is running on a timer, one is allowed to move the pieces in order to maintain the existing position. Thus, one may cause it to go off later than scheduled while it’s on, or make it go on later than scheduled while it’s off.

cause it to go off earlier while it’s on or make it go on earlier while it’s off.

" Is “The Emotion Code” allowed according to Torah?
Hi Rabbi Braun,
I would like to try a method called “The Emotion Code” by Bradly (Brad) Nelson to try to figure out what’s bothering me and the cause.
The method is supposed to “release trapped emotions in the body that cause stress and disfunctionality.”
Many of my friends use this method and it has helped them.
They can actually do this test by speaking with a practitioner over the phone.
Is this allowed according to Torah?
Thank you","
There are many alternative healing methods (as well as meditations) out there that are based on ancient Indian or Chinese tradition, for example, acupuncture, reiki, yoga and mindfulness.
Included in this is the emotion code developed By Dr. Bradley Nelson some 20 years ago, which he clearly states is based off Chinese and Indian tradition, of energies that exist in the world and body, which you can tap into with physical activity as well.
Though this does not necessarily mean that its basis is Avoda Zara, there is definitely room for concern. Upon some research, it appears furthermore that Bradley Nelson attributes receiving his ideas, through prayer to his deity, and he mentions how in the emotion code you’ll find certain ideas which exist in x-tianity (which lav davka can’t be taken from Torah either).

"What is the reason that with regards to relations with one’s wife, one is allowed to have thoughts of Torah? Seemingly, he isn’t in a modest state?","According to Halacha, thinking about words of Torah is not the same as speaking, and is permitted in most circumstances, marital relations included. The exception is in bathrooms and similar places where filth is present, where even thinking words of Torah is forbidden.
In addition, what specific Torah thoughts should one have; Kabbalistic, maybe more Talmudic…?
The idea is to have spiritual and holy concepts in mind, especially those that will help one concentrate and create a sacred environment during relations (and not the opposite, G-d forbid).
Following are some general things that one should have in mind: 1) to fulfill the commandment of “pru urvu” – the Mitzvah to be fruitful and multiply; 2) to accomplish the obligation of satisfying and rejoicing one’s wife; 3) to have decent children who will follow the ways of Torah and Mitzvos; and 4) in the last 6 months of pregnancy, to also have Kavanah for the development of the fetus.
In regards to ‘Torah thoughts’ to think about: 1) the image of a Tzaddik and to have in mind that the child should be similar to him and follow his ways in the proper conduct; 2) the formats/images of 22 letters of the Alef Beis; and 3) some write to contemplate on the verse “venikdashti besoch Bnei Yisroel” – “and I will be sanctified in the midst of Bnei Yisroel” and to visualize as if one throws himself into a fiery furnace in an act of Kiddush Hashem.
I should note that every one of the above is considered as a proper thought and ‘sanctification’, and thus, it suffices to have only one at each time one has relations.
Finally, someone who struggles to have such a thought in mind during the entire time of having relations, should at least strive to do so right before and during ejaculation. If even that proves to be hard to accomplish practically, it is enough (and recommended) to (also) have these thoughts before starting (and close to) the relations.
Also, we do find places in the Torah which mention the concept of enjoyment, such as on Shabbos. It seems as if that the Torah approach to marital relations is that the enjoyment aspect should be disregard, and instead think of other things. I was just wondering if you could help me understand.
As explained above, the purpose is to create a holy atmosphere and mindset, and reduce any ‘animalistic’ behavior etc. as much as possible. It does not mean to diminish or suppress one’s physical pleasure. This applies especially nowadays, when to most people it is almost impossible to totally keep away from feeling corporeal satisfaction.","###question

I should note that every one of the above is considered as a proper thought and ‘sanctification’, and thus, it suffices to have only one at each time one has relations.
Finally, someone who struggles to have such a thought in mind during the entire time of having relations, should at least strive to do so right before and during ejaculation. If even that proves to be hard to accomplish practically, it is enough (and recommended) to (also) have these thoughts before starting (and close to) the relations.
Also, we do find places in the Torah which mention the concept of enjoyment, such as on Shabbos. It seems as if that the Torah approach to marital relations is that the enjoyment aspect should be disregard, and instead think of other things. I was just wondering if you could help me understand.
As explained above, the purpose is to create a holy atmosphere and mindset, and reduce any ‘animalistic’ behavior etc. as much as possible. It does not mean to diminish or suppress one’s physical pleasure. This applies especially nowadays, when to most people it is almost impossible to totally keep away from feeling corporeal satisfaction."

Out of respect, women have adopted a custom not to look at an open Torah scroll or touch a Torah scroll when they are in the state of niddah.

" Can I consider accepting a job in the field of Law enforcement if it may require me to testify against a Jew?
I am considering a career in law enforcement as a forensic accountant. This means that I would be gathering financial evidence to be used in litigation proceedings. Depending on the job, this may only entail analyzing transactions and preparing reports for the attorneys, or it may involve actually testifying and presenting the evidence in court.

There is obviously the likelihood of potentially working on cases involving Jews. Although, this may also depend on the type and location of the job.

 What is the Halacha regarding Hefsek for Devarim Shebikdusha during Bentching?,"Question:
While learning through some of the halachos of hefsek betfillah, I’ve come across some arguments and uncertainties, and I’d like to ask Harav Braun Shlita if he can please clarify halacha l’maase what the Halacha is regarding Hefsek for Devarim Shebikdusha, Modim, etc. during bentching (including the fourth Bracha – if it is any different).
Amswer:
One should not make a hefsek in benching also for Devarim Shebikdusha, just like in Shmonei Esrei. However, one may answer Amen to the Bracha of the mezamen between one Bracha and the next.
During the fourth Bracha one may be mafsik like in psukei dezimra.","###question

Although there is no direct halachic problem, halachic sources indicate that a Talmid Chacham should only do so in a place where people know that it is his sister. Accordingly, it’s best you find a secluded area or you should ask someone if they could allow you to use their home for this purpose.

And are there any concerns regarding Taharas Hamishpacha with getting the vaccine?","
This information is incorrect. From my personal experience and after investigation with other rabbonim too, there is absolutely no basis for this rumor. This has been verified with Rabbonim who work specifically in the area of answering taharas hamishpacha questions full time, fielding Taharas Hamishpacha Hotlines, and heading a Beis Hora’ah for taharas hamishpacha matters.
There are many rumors, lies, half-truths and propaganda out there. In this matter specifically, I’ve heard so-called “reliable sources” quoting in the name of a particular well-known Rav, who deals regularly with taharas hamishpacha that he has seen such issues, only to find out upon investigation directly with him, that he too states that in his experience – as well as his investigation with others – this is untrue.
As always, I suggest that any information relating to medical issues such as vaccines should be gleaned from medical professionals and doctors. When there are conflicting opinions, as in any other matter, one should follow the majority opinion, the consensus established by mainstream doctors. This is the general halachic viewpoint, and particularly when it comes to medical issues.
This is all the more critical nowadays when there is an alarming rise in conspiracy theories on social media. The non-discerning individual, and many of us belong to that category, particularly if not steeped in a solid medical education, would have a difficult time being able to separate fact from fiction. Therefore, the first rule of thumb is not to believe anything shared about medical issues and everything must be checked and verified with the professionals.

In general, there’s a Machlokes if a father and son (or son and father, or two brothers) can get Shvi’i and Maftir. In practice, it may only be done when these Aliyos are being read from two different Sifrei Torah (e.g., on a Shabbos Rosh Chodesh).

In this case, the first relative should leave the Bima before the second comes up for Maftir.
Consequently, in the case you mentioned, it would only be permitted (after the fact, as above) if the Yahrtzeit is on Shabbos.

" Can Rabbonim Make Mistakes?
Many people feel that well-meaning Rabonim who get advice from well-meaning doctors are getting incorrect information with regards to the safety of the Covid vaccines. Is it possible that Rabonim do make mistakes with Siyata Dishmaya?
A very recent example is the closing of shuls during the beginning days of Covid. Obviously, during those times no one knew the severity of the virus, so surely closing down was the proper decision at the time (at least according to most people and the data that was readily available), but knowing what we know now it is a sure thing that young people are safe from the virus and these closing down of the shuls wouldn’t happen today. So is that a “mistake”?
In Vilna, they put the Chassidism into Cherem (ex-communication) and declared them to be heretics with whom no pious Jew should intermarry. That was certainly a mistake.
Lastly, if there is an actual chance of a Rov making a “mistake”, how can there be more confidence in the Rabonim?","
This is a general question about the infallibility of Torah sages. To address this properly is beyond the scope of this platform, but I’ll make some general observations.
There are two basic approaches to this general question:
One must follow what the rabbonim say even if they are in error, as this is the desire of Hashem. In other words: while their arguments might not be true, the halacha follows their position even if it’s not true.
An alternative approach is that a person must consider the fact that Hashem will certainly protect the rabbonim and ensure that they don’t make any mistakes.
Of course, one should always take into account that it is very likely that they’re not in error to begin with, and the only reason one thinks they are mistaken is because one does not have accurate information or is not that advanced in one’s Torah knowledge.
As for the examples you mentioned, vaccines and shul closures, without getting into the specific details of those matters: while in your opinion they might have been in the wrong, it could very well be that the rabbonim possess all the information that you have, but are aware of many other details and facts which you’re not aware of which impacted their decision. Indeed, many people maintain that those decisions have actually saved many lives. As mentioned, once they reached this decision, their position should be followed regardless.
The example you gave about the ex-communication of the Chasidim in Vilna is very different. The halacha is that when Beis Din judges an individual or a group, they may not accept testimony about their behavior without allowing the individual to hear the testimony and be given a chance to challenge it. Furthermore, once they have heard incriminating evidence without the individual being present at the time, they may no longer rule on this case. Any dispute which involves a plaintiff and defendant may only be ruled on if both parties are present and are allowed to present their position in front of the court. If this process has not been followed the ruling is meaningless and void.
This is in contrast to general halachic rulings which involve determining correct or incorrect behavior, where one must obviously follow the position of Torah sages and rabbonim, even if one tends to disagree.
The fundamental difference here is: this applies only when judging a person, when adjudicating a dispute, not when determining a halacha.","###question

Indeed, many people maintain that those decisions have actually saved many lives. As mentioned, once they reached this decision, their position should be followed regardless.
The example you gave about the ex-communication of the Chasidim in Vilna is very different. The halacha is that when Beis Din judges an individual or a group, they may not accept testimony about their behavior without allowing the individual to hear the testimony and be given a chance to challenge it. Furthermore, once they have heard incriminating evidence without the individual being present at the time, they may no longer rule on this case. Any dispute which involves a plaintiff and defendant may only be ruled on if both parties are present and are allowed to present their position in front of the court. If this process has not been followed the ruling is meaningless and void.
This is in contrast to general halachic rulings which involve determining correct or incorrect behavior, where one must obviously follow the position of Torah sages and rabbonim, even if one tends to disagree.
The fundamental difference here is: this applies only when judging a person, when adjudicating a dispute, not when determining a halacha."

"I flew from NY to California this morning and said Tefilas Haderech with “vesachazireinu leshalom”. Now that I’m heading back on the same day but after Shkiah (my flight is 10:30 pm), do I need to make another Tefilas Haderech, or am I covered from the one I made this morning when I mentioned returning?","
You do not say it again.
Explanation:
The “cutoff” for the requirement to say Tefilas Haderech again (whether one said the words “vesachazireinu leshalom” or not) is morning (– following the same rules as Birchas Hatorah, that it is recited every morning).
This applies even if one didn’t sleep the entire night – as soon as alos comes (and one is still traveling), a new Tefilas Haderech should be recited.
If night fell and one slept a “fixed” sleep by night, a new Tefilas Haderech is recited (even before morning).
Note that according to our custom Tefilas Haderech with Shem U’malchus is only said on the first day of the trip – see here:

 Can I eat from vegetables that weren’t checked from bugs before being cooked?,"Questions:
If I cooked vegetables that weren’t checked from bugs (like celery or Broccoli or cabbage) can I eat from:
the soup?
the actual vegetable?

Answers:
It depends on what type of vegetable it is (see below).
Regardless, If it’s possible to strain it in a way that even small bugs won’t go through and it’s not a thick soup, then yes.
If you are dealing with vegetables that are assumed automatically to contain bugs, the vegetable shouldn’t be eaten. Checking wouldn’t help then (if it softens through cooking). With regular vegetables that only occasionally contain bugs, it would be allowed (if you don’t see bugs there).

Bideieved..if 5 people were halfway through (or further) and the 6th joined…is that tefila btzibur and does the chazan do a full chazaras hashatz in such a situation?.

In all these cases, Chazoras Hashatz is done.

Generally, it is recommended to have a Hechsher on urns with a thermostat for Shabbos use, as there might be an issue with removing hot water from the urn, causing the remaining water inside to cool off faster, ultimately effecting the urn to boil faster.

" What should be done with the peppers from Eretz Yisroel?
We received a package of different color peppers, and on the red ones have a sticker that says it’s from Israel. What do we need to do with all the red peppers?","
The dinim of Shmitah and the way they apply in Chutz La’aretz can be complex, but to summarize:
Fruits: Fruits grown in Eretz Yisroel during the year of Shmitah, even if grown without any human effort, have a level of holiness to them and may be only eaten in a certain way, may not be disposed of when still edible, and for most fruit, must be made hefker at a certain point of the year (known as the zman biur) etc.
Vegetables: Additionally, the Chachomim decreed well as that all vegetables grown during Shmitah, even if grown without any human effort, may not be eaten at all, even in Eretz Yisroel. This is known as the prohibition on Sefichei Shvi’is. The reason for this prohibition was that since vegetables can be harvested not too long after planting (as opposed to fruit trees which can take years to mature,) we are worried that unscrupulous individuals will plant vegetables during Shmitah and claim that they just grow on their own.
They also ruled that Shmitah fruit may not be removed from Eretz Yisroel (even though they retain their holiness when removed).
Therefore, since we cannot be sure that the red peppers, were grown and harvested before the start of the year of Shmitah, they may not be eaten. However they may not be discarded either, since they retain the holiness of Shmitah. Therefore they should be left in their place to a point which they are no longer edible,(at which point they lose their holiness,) and then they may be discarded normally.

  Is it my obligation to inform the Shul’s management that this act is prohibited?
I passed by my Shul’s Mikvah this past Friday night after davening, and I noticed that there was a steady stream of dryer exhaust/steam coming out of its windows. It was clear that a clothes dryer was in use. This happened two hours after sunset, which means that the Goyim clearly started the cycle on Shabbos.
While I know that if a Goy is paid a lump sum to do something every day, including Shabbos (Bihavla’ah), and there is no enjoyment immediately being derived from his actions, then that is fine, however – shouldn’t this case be judged as an act of “Meleches Goy Bifarhesia” which is prohibited due to Maris Ayin?
And if so, is it my obligation to inform the Shul’s management that this act is prohibited?.

How to use a toilet which flushes by a sensor?,"Where no other bathroom is available, you may use an auto-flush toilet by activating the sensor in an irregular manner, for example walking away on your heels or sides of the feet in an uncomfortable manner. Ideally, you should first place a tissue or paper towel over the sensor, in a manner that it will eventually fall off later by itself, so that the toilet won’t flush immediately when you leave the toilet.
How to use water from a faucet which is operated only by sensor?
You should use a bottle of water or another cleanser.
Where this is not possible: After using the bathroom, you may satisfy with rubbing your hands with a cloth or other material, unless you’re planning on davening thereafter, in which case you may ask a non-Jew to fill up a cup of water for you. If however, you want to wash your hands before davening but you did not use the bathroom or touch parts of the body that are usually covered, you should just rub your hands.

• Generally:
For a child whose birthday is from after Lag Baomer until Erev Shavuos, the Upshernish haircut should take place on Erev Shavuos.

• However, regarding someone whose birthday is on 19 Iyar, a day after Lag Baomer:
There are instructions from the Rebbe to perform the haircut on Lag Baomer.
While in most places it appears that it should take place on Lag Baomer itself (during the day), a day before the child turns 3, others record that it should be done on the actual birthday, right after nightfall on the night after Lag Baomer.
See here the testimony of three people who were all instructed by the Rebbe to do it on Lag Baomer: R. SB Popak, R. YY Hecht and R. Refoel Hartman. In the case of R. Hecht, the Rebbe himself did the cutting. (This information has been independently verified by us). In the case of R. Hartman, we have the actual answer of the Rebbe.

While technically it’s not forbidden to host single bachurim and girls at the same meal, this is considered inappropriate. One should go to great lengths to arrange their hosting of meals in such a way that bachurim and girls aren’t invited at the same time.

The general age for when to separate kids is when they start maturing to understand the concept of separation between men and women. This is generally between the ages of 6 and 9. Children of 9 years and older, must be educated not to mingle and should be seated separately.
Where circumstances require such an arrangement, they should be seated at different tables.

"Do we still hold by this as a practical thing to do nowadays, and if so does that also include the half-day fasts that he mentions?
The Alter Rebbe distinguishes between the extra fasts, in accordance with the number of times the sin was done total, and the actual fasts totaling the number corresponding to the particular sin.
Although he goes into the whole thing about “only a healthy person etc.”, that was in regards to what he said about the Mekubalim who say to do 3 times the total, then he says to redeem them in tzedakah.
But then he says to complete the total amount at least once in one’s life, to push it off to the short winter days, and for the other number (totaling 3 times the standard amount) to do half-day fasting, and then to be stringent according to the other opinion, to redeem all of the extra ones (that add up to the total multiplied by each time) with tzedakah.
Do we still follow this “baal nefesh” thing nowadays?","
Nowadays, personal fasts are not recommended.
The Alter Rebbe writes in the third chapter of Igeret HaTeshuvah that fasting – with the exception of mandatory public fast days – must never come at the expense of one’s health or strength. If fasting will weaken you to the extent that you will not be able to serve G‑d that day with the same energy and vigor as you would have had you eaten—don’t. In fact, the Talmud is very clear about this: One who fasts despite the fact that it weakens him, is called a sinner.
In today’s day and age, when most of us are used to eating three round meals a day, there is almost no one who can claim to be unaffected by fasting.
More importantly, it is the spirit of repentance, the true repentance, that comes along with fasting that counts.
Rather, instead of fasting one should do as the Alter Rebbe brings from the words of Daniel, when advising Nebuchadnezzar: “Redeem your sins with charity, and your wrongdoing by being kind to the needy”. This can be done by donating to a charitable cause the monetary value of the food you eat on a given day.

"I have been practicing shechita at a halal place and many Muslims wear something that looks like a yarmulke. I have learned that some clients thought I was Muslim and therefore allow me to shecht (it’s totally kosher for a Muslim to eat the shechita of a Jew, but some prefer a Muslim do it, because it’s more “mehudar” in their eyes.

I am doing this for free and the owners are very kind about the fact that in order to be a shochet you need practice, but the customers have no idea that I am doing it.

 Is it permissible to pay for non-Jewish workers to eat Treif in a Jewish-owned Halal store?,"
It’s allowed. This applies only if the food never enters your ownership and you do not touch the food, rather you are just paying them for it. The payment can be made in either of the following methods:
You could tell them “Here’s money and buy yourself food”, as long as you don’t specify what the food is.
You can tell the storekeeper give them food and I will pay you.
However, you may not give money to the storekeeper in advance so they should be able to buy there.
If the items you’re buying do not contain food which is assur b’hana’ah (forbidden to benefit from), such as beef, lamb, or goat meat and dairy mixed together while hot, for instance a beef hamburger with cheese, or pizza with pepperoni, you may even give money to the storekeeper in advance.
Some allow in this case – where it’s not assur b’hana’ah – even buying the food outright if it’s to feed your workers, but not to give as a gift (unless it’s food which only forbidden rabbinically). It’s advisable to be stringent not to buy forbidden food to feed workers, even if it’s not assur b’hana’ah, unless it’s food which only forbidden rabbinically.

"I am unable to understand the Rav’s statement. Is the Rav saying that taking upon unnecessary, random new stringencies in life, actually make a person become lenient in other Halachic matters?","
Yes. There’s a concept in Halacha called “chumra d’asi lidei kula” – a stringency that leads to a leniency.
There are many ways such a thing is possible. As a general rule, any chumra should be done bli neder. Otherwise, it could cause a stumbling block.
Sometimes the obsession over a specific stringency does not allow a person the emotional strength to give attention and focus on the fundamentals.
Taking on a stringency in a place where other people do not practice this behavior can sometimes come along with a feeling of haughtiness and looking down upon others, or at least it might be considered “mechezei k’yuhara”, it appears as though one is showing off.
In a case where the particular stringency is very difficult for a person, it may be difficult for the person to serve Hashem with simcha. It might even cause the person to resent it, and as a result, they might resent other areas of yiddishkeit too.
As a general rule, one must ensure that any stringent behavior is in accordance with a person’s current standing in avodas Hashem, as we are not encouraged to jump to levels that are higher than us, both because it might lead to a downfall in other areas and additionally because our avoda should be bi’pinimiyus, grounded and internalized.
In the particular case in the link above, there could be a number of reasons why this would lead to a leniency in other areas. Aside for the above-mentioned reasons which apply here as well, it could create a problem in Shalom Bayis or similar problems.
Of course, there are many advantages to taking upon oneself stringencies, particularly in the area of tznius. However, this must be done in an appropriate manner, under the guidance of one’s mashpia etc.","###question

" Is there an issue with having a black Tallis Gadol?
Is there an issue with having a blacktallis gadol with white strips, instead of the standard white beged with black strips? The actual tzitzis strings would remain white as normal.","
Strictly speaking, there are no Halachic requirements relating to the color of the garment. However, the Poskim, including the Alter Rebbe, write that it should be white and consistent with the Tzitzis strings, in order to fulfill the Mitzva according to all opinions.
The black stripes are also sourced in Halacha (although not required, and some insist that the garment be completely white without any stripes), as well as in Kabbala.
In my opinion, doing otherwise would be considered a change to the traditional manner and should not be done.
Follow up Question:
What if the person is asking because he is trying to follow a Yemenite custom from way back. Does that change what someone should do today?
Answer:
If he is indeed Yemenite and there are still currently Yemenite communities that do so it is okay. To the best of my knowledge, even Yemenite communities currently do not wear black talleisim. Even in the past, this was only done for the weekday tallis. (It is assumed that since they wore their tallis – which is very long in Yemenite tradition – all day it was extremely difficult to have it white which would make it very dirty. Even if they would make it white it would end up turning out black because they wore it even throughout work etc.).
See references below from Yemenite sources.
In any event, since the Yemenite custom was to make the tzitzis always white, it would be correct to make the Tallis this way too, in accordance with the Rambam – the key halachic authority for Yemenites – which maintains that tallis and tzitzis should always be the same color.","###question

 Is there a Jewish source for not stepping/walking/jumping over someone?,"The Gemarah in various places teaches us that it is not proper to step/jump over another Jew in order to get to one’s place, as it is considered treating him or her in a disrespectful manner. This applies even to a simple Jew, because all Jewish people are descendants of Avraham Yitzchak and Yaakov. Even a leader or Dayan etc. should not do so unless his services are needed by the people ‘blocking’ his way.

  Is there a Jewish source for not stepping/walking/jumping over someone?.
 ###answer 
 The Gemarah in various places teaches us that it is not proper to step/jump over another Jew in order to get to one’s place, as it is considered treating him or her in a disrespectful manner. This applies even to a simple Jew, because all Jewish people are descendants of Avraham Yitzchak and Yaakov. Even a leader or Dayan etc. should not do so unless his services are needed by the people ‘blocking’ his way.

 Does oat flour need to be kosher in general? Does Chabad eat Matzah made out of oats?,"Kashrus:
Oat flour is inherently kosher and requires no hechsher for year-round use (not for Pesach), if there are no added kosher sensitive ingredients.
Obviously, one must ensure the flour isn’t infested. If one is particular about chodosh, you would need to check the date code.
Matzah:
There are serious shaalos with oat matzoh since they are treated with heat in order to store them. There are available oat matzos that are not treated with heat. These should be used when necessary. Even so, wheat matzah is always preferred.

Someone took money from me; about $1,300; without my permission. They took a few years to pay it back to me. When they finished paying it back, they paid me $50 extra. Do I have to give that back to them? Is it considered interest?","
First of all, if they gave it to you by mistake, due to a miscalculation or the like, you must return the money to them.
If they gave it to you as compensation for the time that they had the money in their hands, in other words, interest, then it would depend:
If you did not give him the money for any purpose, and you never turned the debt into a loan, you would be permitted to keep the money.
However, if you gave him the money to buy something and he used it for himself, or you turned it into a loan, it would be forbidden for him to give you the interest and for you to receive it, but you need not return it after the fact.

Indeed, not all descendants of the Shaloh have adopted this minhag. But those who have done so should continue adhering to it.

" Who Should Lead the Zimun?
Is there a Minhag for the Baal Habais to lead the Zimmun?
Is there a difference between Shabbos night and Shabbos day meal?
What if there is a kohen present?","
There is such a custom that on Friday night the host leads the zimmun. Otherwise, he may honor the guest. This custom applies even when a kohen is present.
Explanation:
Although there is a mitzvah to honor the guests, this only applied in the past when only one individual bentched and he exempted the others. Nowadays, when everyone bentches themselves there is no such mitzvah. Even in those days, if the host wished to lead the bentching himself and not honor the guest, at any time, he may do so.
A kohen takes precedence only if he is equal in Torah standing to the others. Otherwise, the Talmid Chochom precedes him. Additionally, all this applies where all attendees are hosts or all are guests (and the host isn’t joining).","###question
